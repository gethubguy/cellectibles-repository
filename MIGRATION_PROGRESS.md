# Migration Progress Report

## Summary
Migration to the `collectibles` repository structure is progressing well. We've completed Phases 1-3 of the migration plan while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1: Repository Structure
- Created comprehensive directory structure for multiple archive types
- Set up `checklists/`, `archives/`, `enrichment/`, and `tools/` directories
- Organized archives by type: `forums/`, `auctions/`, `content/`

### Phase 2: Compatibility Layer
- Created `BaseScraper` abstract class with configuration support
- Built YAML-based configuration system
- Implemented `Net54Scraper` wrapper for legacy code
- Created `scraper_wrapper.py` for seamless switching between old/new
- Updated storage to support new archive paths

### Phase 3: Data Migration Strategy
- Created `MultiArchiveStorage` class for isolated archive storage
- Set up archive-specific data directories
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow with `USE_NEW_SCRAPERS` toggle
- Created example configs for Heritage, PSA, and PrewarCards

## Current State
- **Old structure**: Fully operational (default)
- **New structure**: Ready for testing
- **Backward compatibility**: Complete
- **Risk level**: Low (can switch back instantly)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
```
tools/scrapers/base/base_scraper.py     # Abstract base class
tools/scrapers/base/storage.py          # Multi-archive storage
tools/scrapers/forums/net54_scraper.py  # Net54 wrapper
configs/net54.yaml                      # Net54 configuration
configs/heritage.yaml                   # Heritage example
configs/psa.yaml                        # PSA example
configs/prewarcards.yaml               # PrewarCards example
scripts/scraper_wrapper.py              # Compatibility wrapper
scripts/storage_updated.py              # Updated storage class
scripts/test_migration.py               # Migration test script
.github/workflows/test-new-structure.yml # Test workflow
.github/workflows/scrape_updated.yml    # Updated main workflow
```

### Modified Files
```
requirements.txt                        # Added PyYAML
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Test in GitHub Actions** - Run test workflow with small dataset
2. **Verify data paths** - Ensure data saves to correct locations
3. **Test resume capability** - Interrupt and resume scraping

### Short Term (Week 2)
1. **Parallel testing** - Run both old and new in parallel
2. **Performance comparison** - Check for any speed differences
3. **Data migration plan** - Plan for moving existing data

### Medium Term (Week 3-4)
1. **Switch to new structure** - Make new structure default
2. **Add first new archive** - Start with Heritage auctions
3. **Remove compatibility layers** - Clean up old code

### Long Term (Month 2+)
1. **Expand archives** - Add all planned sources
2. **Implement enrichment** - Add analysis tools
3. **Rename repository** - Change from net54 to collectibles

## Testing Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test old structure (default)
python scripts/scraper_wrapper.py --stats

# Test new structure
USE_NEW_SCRAPERS=true python scripts/scraper_wrapper.py --stats

# Run migration tests
python scripts/test_migration.py
```

### GitHub Actions Testing
1. Go to Actions → "Test New Structure"
2. Run workflow with test type "stats"
3. Check output for any errors

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Set `USE_NEW_SCRAPERS=false` (instant rollback)
2. Or use original workflow file: `scrape.yml`
3. All data remains intact in original locations

## Notes
- PyYAML is required for new configuration system
- New structure uses same delay/rate limiting as before
- All scraped data format remains identical
- GitHub Actions artifacts work with both structures
