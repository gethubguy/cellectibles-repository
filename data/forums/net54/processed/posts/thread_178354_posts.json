I've seen them a few times now, and I'm always impressed. \r\n\r\nI have to sit down, and start figuring out how I'm going to start storing all my different sets, and what's going to the safe deposit box. At some point in the future, I might get one of your boxes for my T206 cards at home. The Box Factory boxes I have can be used for my PSA slabs. \r\n\r\nThis box looks like it just fits the set so well. A really beautiful heirloom storage case for the best set ever made. I think $175 a box is a steal.",
