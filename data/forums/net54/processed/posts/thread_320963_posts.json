Purchased it raw, thought it may have been glue on the back because some of the back shows through but it is paper loss. Other than that it\u2019s a clean, attractive card (IMO). I was going to send it in for grading but then again it\u2019s not going to get better than 1/1.5 given the paper loss so it\u2019s almost pointless.  If it helps, I\u2019m attaching a picture here where I overlay this against another card in a holder to give a comparison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote name=\"westwin\" post=2234187]Hey Ed,\r\nDoes it measure?
