Please let me know if interested and I can give you my phone number to meet up.\r\nPlease excuse the poor scans.  It seems only PSA slabs scan decently.\r\n\r\nBender - $550.00\r\nYoung - $850.00\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBob\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=526053&d=1658366748[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=526054&d=1658366757[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=526055&d=1658366769[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=526056&d=1658366777[/IMG]",
