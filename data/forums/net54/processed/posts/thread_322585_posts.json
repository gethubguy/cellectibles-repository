I'm not too picky about technical condition but tend to like nice looking cards in fair or better.  \r\n\r\nPlease PM me if you'd like to talk trade.  No emails please unless we know each other already.  Too many scammer emails lately.\r\n\r\nIf you are a scammer, please don't waste my time.  I'm going to ask for references, and if I make a trade with someone I don't know, they will be sending their side of the trade first.",
