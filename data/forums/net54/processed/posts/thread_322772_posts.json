I'm not too particular on the back as long as the front is centered and presents well.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI think what Eliot was trying to say is that the Davis is a Polar Bear NO PRINT (meaning it was not printed with the Polar Bear back). :)\r\n\r\nThe only backs that his card are known to have been printed with are:  Piedmont 150 & 350, Sovereign 150, Sweet Cap 150 Factory 25, 30 & 649 Overprint, Sweet Cap 350 Factory 25 & 30, EPDG, Old Mill, and Brown Hindu.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your search!",
