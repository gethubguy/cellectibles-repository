    "post_content": "T206 Ed Walsh (Portrait)\r\n\r\nPiedmont 150 Factory 25 back\r\n\r\nInsert the typical \"looks great for the grade\" verbiage into this description. ;)\r\n\r\nNewly graded SGC 1 \r\n\r\nSOLD Shipped (in the U.S.)\r\n\r\nWrinkle top right corner. Surface wrinkle on the right shoulder area (looking at the card.) Nearly impossible to see in the scans no matter what settings I use. I've included both the SGC scans, and my own of the card. It's there I assure you.\r\n\r\nTiny bit of paper loss on lower back of card. By the word \"Factory\", and possibly on the other bottom corner, but not affecting any text.\r\n\r\nPay almost any way you like.\r\n\r\nPM to reserve or e-mail me at David at Boxingtreasures dot com\r\n\r\nThanks.",
