Not interested in Authentic examples, and likely only a 1, 1.5 or 2 (or maybe better). \r\n\r\nLooking for centered examples only. I have a small budget, but can probably pay between $3,500 to $5,000 depending on how nice the card is. \r\n\r\nAlso open to Green Cobbs but am aware of the price hike there at the moment. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nMark",
