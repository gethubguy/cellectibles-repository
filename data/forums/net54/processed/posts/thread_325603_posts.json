    "post_content": "Hey Everyone, I have to ask $1100 for the SGC 1 and $1400for the raw. I cannot budge on these prices. I am only asking these cost because I got a killer deal on a much better Cy Young Portrait, and the value/quality offsets the cost of the two I am selling. If you want both, I can sell them together for $2300. Both killer deals, and you would have success on eBay doing a ten day auction, OR both are good additions to T206 goals. I appreciate the interest, and would love to ship both of these out Monday. All day tomorrow is at AFA for the AF Vs Navy game. Thanks!!   I am paying for shipping as well!!!",
