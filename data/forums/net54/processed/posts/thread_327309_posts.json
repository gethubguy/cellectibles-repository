    "post_content": "For sale is the T206 card for Chicago Cubs star outfielder Jimmy Sheckard.  The Tolstoi back comes with a PSA 3.5 rating. The sale price is ( $435, dropped from $485. I listed the card on EBay today, and it reminded me how little I enjoy purchasers paying sales tax, and sellers paying EBay fees. [emoji52])\nI will include free shipping and insurance.\nPayPal F&F would be nice, as would Zelle. However, if you feel uncomfortable with either of these methods of payment, you may use regular PayPal. I will not charge a fee for that choice. \nLeon has appropriately been warning people to be wary of fraud in buying cards. In that regard, I have the following information:\n  1. My online EBay store is Vintage Tobacco. There, I have 533 transactions with zero dissatisfied customers.\n  2. I have successfully purchased and sold cards through this forum in the past.\n  3. I consider my reputation more important than any one transaction.\n\nSo, please respond if you are interested in this card, and thank you for looking.\nJeff\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20221107/b40606507a7c5e5f2eaa9c2479a51899.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20221107/cb48086d09fb0814fa7f122c7e44f64f.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
