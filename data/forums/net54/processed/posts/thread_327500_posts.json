I have to collect sales tax from Washington state buyers.\n\nShipping and insurance is $5.  Or you could choose $1 PWE shipping, which is at your own risk because I can't track it.  Totally your call which you'd prefer.\n\nHahn SC 150/25 GD $40\nSmith Old Mill poor $50\nStovall Sov350 poor (back is a little tacky, but shouldn't stick to anything in a permanent way) $50\nFlanagan Old Mill poor/fair $65\nLentz fair $75\nBradley SC 150/25 (crease-free) $45\nRaymond GD $40 SOLD\nHinchman VGEX (couple stains, no creases) $50",
