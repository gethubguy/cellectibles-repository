This card is insanely nice. I assume the reason for the grade is the ever so small pulls on the upper and left borders on the back. Great corners. Fabulous 150 series image and color. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52509705748_699249991f_c_d.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52509434589_4fb9e0b748_c_d.jpg[/IMG]",
