    "post_content": "Offering for sale a very nice T206 Mordecai Brown Sweet Caporal Factory 350/460 Factory 42 graded SGC 5.  This card has been a cornerstone of my Cubs T206 collection for years, but as I now have other interests (2 daughters in college) it is time for this card to have a new home.  Very tough to find factory 42 out of the 460 series, only a couple graded higher that I have ever run across. Asking $ 2,750 OBO, shipping and insurance included in price, payment via PayPal.",
