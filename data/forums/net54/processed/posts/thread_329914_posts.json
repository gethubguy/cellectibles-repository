    "post_content": "Hey All!\n\nI know this is a long shot, but I would like to swap this SGC VG 3 Parent Hindu Brown (NFS) for a Lefty Leifield Hindu Brown, ideally similar condition and a clean back.  Needed for my Leifield back run.  The Parent is in my T206 back display so the back is nice, there is a pin hole missed by SGC. \n\nI would add some cash if yours is nicer...\n\nlet me know if any interest.\n\nthanks!\n\nCliff\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=551141&d=1672872709[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=551142&d=1672872717[/IMG]",
