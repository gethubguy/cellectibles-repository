I think this one is nicer though. Just say'in ;) \r\n\r\nPrice on Mr. Mcgraw is $3,000 delivered - drop me a PM if interested. Thanks all, \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/sgc7t206mcgrawwhatfront.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/sgc7t206mcgrawwhatback.jpg[/IMG]",
