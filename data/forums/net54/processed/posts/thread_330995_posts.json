    "post_content": "Selling this lot of 108 T206 cards that came out of a collection I purchased. The cards are in this lot are all shown, front and back. There are 6 types of backs in the lot...Polar Bear, Piedmont 150, Piedmont 350, Sweet Caporal 150, Sweet Caporal 350 and Sweet Caporal 350 -460. As you can see these are in fair to poor condition with some being better than others as shown. I took the better ones from this collection and they were graded by PSA from authentic to PSA 1.5 and none came back as reprints.\r\nLooking to sell as a lot only unless unable right now.\r\n\r\nPrice -SOLD!!!! Payment can be Paypal FF, Venmo, check or MO.  For clarity to all interested, the first to claim it with an \"I'll take it\", or something to that effect gets it over negotiations/questions/etc.  \r\nI have more for sale in other sections as well if interested.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPrice has been lowered and will continue to do so until they find a new home.",
