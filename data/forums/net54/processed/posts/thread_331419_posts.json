    "post_content": "The T206 trading thread on the main page inspired me to post this here...I'd consider trading this SGC 3.5 Green Cobb for the right scenario. Would consider a Drum (graded higher than a 1), Brown Old Mill, BL460 graded higher than 1.5, (very) rare back HOFers (especially Cobb). Also looking for rare back Chase Blue Portraits (P42, Cycle 460, Lenox, Red Hindu, CB, BL350).\n\n(May also consider drastic front miscuts).\n\nCould be partial trade/partial cash.\n\nSend me a PM, thanks!\nMichael",
