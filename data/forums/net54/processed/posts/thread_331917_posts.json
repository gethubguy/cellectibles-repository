    "post_content": "I am getting married in a few months, so the time has come to start liquidating some of the non-essential cards in my collection to help with costs (and prove to my fianc\u00e9 that I have a handle on this addiction ;) ). That being the case, I have a few ungraded t206 commons, including two horizontals (pattee and Murphy) for sale. Several N.Y. National players that would give someone a great start on completing the NY team photo set.\n\nThe cards have creases, some paper loss, and general wear. Please see the photos for a more detailed description. I am also happy to send additional photos upon request. For the sake of simplicity I would like to sell as one lot, but I will entertain the idea of breaking up the group if necessary. \n\nAsking [STRIKE]$475 [/STRIKE] [STRIKE]$400[/STRIKE] $375 ($53/card) OBO for the lot. Last reduction.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=558643&d=1676856160[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=558644&d=1676856190[/IMG]",
