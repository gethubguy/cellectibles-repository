    "post_content": "Nicely centered copy of the Tinker bat off card, graded SGC 3.5.  For what it's worth, it is SC 350-460 Factory 42 Overprint back, is more rare than Old Mill, Polar Bear, and Sovereign 150 backs per the rankings on t206resource.\r\n\r\nIt is $525 postpaid in the continental U.S. Payment via PayPal \"gift\", personal check, bank check, or money order. Commitment to purchase outweighs any ongoing negotiation. You won't be disappointed.\r\n\r\nReferences available on inquiry. I've been on net54 since 2009 and have transacted business with many, many collectors over the years.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a PM if interested.\r\n\r\nOther T206 HOFers and prewar cards:\r\n\r\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83790/tinker[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83791/tinker[/IMG]",
