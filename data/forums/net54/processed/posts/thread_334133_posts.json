I was looking for something besides shelves for slabs and couldn't find a good solution... so I created this bespoke design for tobacco cards, to let your collection shine instead of being stuck in a book...\r\nPlease check it out:\r\n\r\n[url]www.martimar-cards.com[/url]\r\n\r\n.. and feel free to email with questions... I just launched the site last month so everything is on sale... would love any feedback or suggestions...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCraig\r\n\r\n[url]martimar-cards@hotmail.com[/url]",
