    "post_content": "I def have adult ADD, so after getting the T206 set, I'm wanting to get the same current grade in Sweet Caporal backs. PSA says 508 of the 520 are avail.\nSo is anyone willing to trade their Sweet Caporals for my Piedmont's and about 10-12 are PB, OM or Sov. I don't want to go down in grade but a slight .5 or 1 with some boot is fair. Most of mine are PSA 4 & 5, I have about 30+ PSA 3 & 3.5, and 20+ PSA 6. All but 5 are new PSA graded with lighthouse logo etc. NONE are (_) graded with MK, MC etc nor have any paper loss.\nTracy Snider\n[url]tracy@sniderinsurance.com[/url] is best/fastest response for me.",
