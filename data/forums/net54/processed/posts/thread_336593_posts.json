For my binder, I\u2019m fine with presentable 1\u2019s, and obviously raw cards as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any of these HOFers in PSA or SGC 1s, or raw, and would like to trade up to a 2, let me know. \r\n\r\nWould love to do my 2 for your lower grade of the same card (plus t206 commons to even out the value). Let me know if you are interested.
