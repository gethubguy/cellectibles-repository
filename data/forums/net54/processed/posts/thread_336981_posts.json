Per T206resource.com there are 329 known card backs of the 17 different subject Tigers in 30 variations.\n\nI\u2019ll be looking for PSA/SGC 3-5\u2019s of the more common backs and will sacrifice quality for rare backs due to price. I\u2019m willing to buy raw, but I\u2019ll eventually get them graded. \n\nMuch thanks in advance!\n\nEdit; I\u2019m on Blowout\u2019s forum (rememberthepast) and have an eBay account as well if needing any references.",
