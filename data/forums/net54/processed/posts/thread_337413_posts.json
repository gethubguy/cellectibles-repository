    "post_content": "I have another post like this and thought I'd try it again, I guess you could call it a step down sale. I'm going to post a few cards for sale each with a starting price today 7/4. I will also post lower prices that I would accept at 2 day intervals. Buyers can state that they would buy the card at any of the posted prices at any time, if we get to that date and the card hasn't sold on a previous day at a higher price then the first person stating they would buy the card at the current day price gets it. Days start and end at midnight for these purposes. For instance, I post a card stating the following:\r\n\r\nDay 1 $250\r\nDay 2 $225\r\nDay 3 $200\r\nDay 4 $180\r\n\r\nExample 1: On Day 2 someone says I'll take the card at $225 they they win the card.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nExample 2: On Day 1 some says I'll take it at $200 on day 3. If the card hasn't sold by Day 3 at Day 1 or Day 2 price that person saying on Day 1 they would take it at $200 gets the card.\r\n\r\nPretty simple, it lets you lock in a price on the card at a level you're comfortable with and let's me hopefully sell the card at a price that I am happy with. Note all prices include shipping, please state your price level in the body of the post and whether it's no fee venmo or pp gs.  If you are an NC resident please add 6.5% ST.\r\n\r\nHere we go.\r\n\r\nT206 Bill Dahlen SC 150/30 - SGC 3\r\n\r\n7/4 $320 venmo no fee or $322.50 pp gs\r\n7/6 $300 venmo no fee or $311 pp gs\r\n7/8 $285 venmo no fee or $295 pp gs\r\n7/10 $275 venmo no fee or $285 pp gs\r\n7/12 $265 venmo no fee or $275 pp gs\r\n\r\n\r\nT206 Red Dooin P150 - SGC 4\r\n\r\n7/4 $140 venmo no fee or $145 pp gs\r\n7/6 $132.50 venmo no fee or $137.50 pp gs\r\n7/8 $125 venmo no fee or $127.50 pp gs\r\n\r\n\r\nT206 Doyle w/ Bat Tolstoi - PSA 2\r\n\r\n7/4 $400 venmo no fee or $416 pp gs\r\n7/6 $380 venmo no fee or $392 pp gs\r\n7/8 $360 venmo no fee or $372 pp gs\r\n7/10 $340 venmo no fee or $355 pp gs\r\n7/12 $320 venmo no fee or $332.50 pp gs\r\n\r\n\r\nT206 Wiltse no Cap P150 - SGC 4 \r\n\r\n7/4 $185 venmo no fee or $190 pp gs\r\n7/6 $175 venmo no fee or $180 pp gs\r\n7/8 $165 venmo no fee or $170 pp gs\r\n7/10 $157.50 venmo no fee or $160 pp gs\r\n\r\n\r\nT206 Wiltse w/Cap SC 350-460 42 Overprint (Misplaced overprint stamp) - PSA 3\r\n\r\n7/4 $150 venmo no fee or $155 pp gs\r\n7/6 $140 venmo no fee or $145 pp gs\r\n7/8 $135 venmo no fee or $139 pp gs\r\n7/10 $130 venmo no fee or $134 pp gs\r\n\r\n\r\nT206 Wiltse w/ Cap SC 350-460/30, Slight name at top - PSA 5(mc)\r\n\r\n7/4 $225 venmo no fee or $232.50 pp gs\r\n7/6 $215 venmo no fee or $222.50 pp gs\r\n7/8 $205 venmo no fee or $212.50 pp gs\r\n7/10 $195 venmo no fee or $202.50 pp gs\r\n7/12 $180 venmo no fee or $187.50 pp gs",
