    "post_content": "A rare peek behind the curtain of the printing process of the T206 set. There are two known copies of the Downey batting that can be found with these Blue numbers on the bottom. I believe them to be the remnants of a factory number similar to what can be found of some Sweet Caporal cards.\r\n\r\nI wanted to put this up on the market to possibly trade. I mainly collect N.Y. Nationals (Giants). I would love to trade this for another print anomaly of a Giants player or maybe a rare back combination.\r\nPlease feel free to reach out to me via email if you have something I may be interested in at [url]maxjcards@gmail.com[/url] \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52840372776_98826a242a_k.jpg[/IMG]",
