    "post_content": "This is a first for me. I have never sold/traded any part of my baseball collection. When I dived back into the hobby in 1981, the goal was just to amass as many cards as possible. I have decided to refocus and try the trading route for my collection needs. I am two cards shy (Mantle and Musial) of finishing the 1954 Red Heart set. I lament the fact that I failed to purchase both cards before the price explosion.   \r\n\r\nPerhaps, your collecting focus has changed as well. With the cards of interest listed below, it is likely that my side of the deal will include multiple cards. I am not against adding cash (within reason) to any deal. \r\n\r\nCards of interest (ordered by year):\r\n\r\n1952 Coca-Cola Tips PSA 4 or 5\r\n\r\n1953 Bowman Pee Wee Reese PSA 7\r\n\r\n1954 Red Heart Stan Musial PSA 7\r\n\r\n1954 Red Heart Mickey Mantle PSA 7 (a man can dream)\r\n\r\n1961 Topps Mickey Mantle Sporting News All-Star PSA 7\r\n\r\n1961 Topps Mickey Mantle MVP PSA 7\r\n\r\n1969 Topps Mickey Mantle PSA 7\r\n\r\n1971 Topps Thurman Munson PSA 7\r\n\r\n1973 Topps Mike Schmidt PSA 7\r\n\r\nPre-1980 PSA 7 (minimum) Rookie Cards of HOF players.  \r\n\r\nBoard cred: I joined NET54 in August of 2010. During covid, I asked Leon to change my handle from Biohazard to Huck. I have participated in two of Bobby\u2019s PSA submissions. In 2020, I had a successful transaction (1954 Red Heart Ashburn) with LACardsGuy.\r\n\r\nSo, get creative and let\u2019s make a deal. I am looking forward to hearing your trade offers!\r\n\r\nThis will be posted in two sections (T206 and 1960-1979).\r\n\r\nThe following are the cards being offered. If you really need to see the backs, send me a PM.  Each case has a card sleeve which is causing the glare.",
