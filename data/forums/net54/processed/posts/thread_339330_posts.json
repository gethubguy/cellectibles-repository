    "post_content": "This card entered my collection many years ago via a board member. Now it is time for it to move on to someone else. \r\n\r\nRube used to live in a PSA 3 plastic house but was freed from it long ago. He is looking quite well after all these years and can still be classified as VG-ish. See images below to help you form an opinion on condition. PM or post in thread with any questions or requests.\r\n\r\nPrice is $OLD\r\n\r\nPayPal FF preferred. If PayPal G&S add $10. Shipping and insurance is included.",
