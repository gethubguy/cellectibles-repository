    "post_content": "Finished my 2nd t206 set and really only need one so I just listed on ebay.  \r\n\r\nIt's a 520 that has every card a PSA 2 with no qualifiers or half grades.  I think it represents pretty well for the grade with a few clunkers for the gradej(as you might expect).\r\n\r\nHere's the link:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/175887133707[/url]\r\n\r\nFor the set registry which has all of the images, click here:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/psasetregistry/baseball/t206-sets/1909-11-t206-complete-player-image-set-no-wagner-doyle-n-y-natl-plank-magie/publishedset/390557[/url]\r\n\r\nPlease PM if you have any questions but please don't ask if I'm breaking the set or what's the best I can do.  Price is shown on the ebay listing so feel free to make an offer if you'd like.  \r\n\r\nHappy to meet in person to do an exchange as well provided it's within a reasonable distance from Central Ohio.  \r\n\r\nThanks and yes, I'm keeping my other set....haha\r\n\r\nTroy Rambo",

I'll keep the big set (522) and work on a few upgrades but will likely focus on some other tobacco era sets.  Especially now that I have some extra room w/the 2 set being gone!  \r\n\r\nThen again, maybe a binder set???.... hmmm.....",
