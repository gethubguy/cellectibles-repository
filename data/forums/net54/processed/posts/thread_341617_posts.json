Does anyone know where it's at, willing to add cash with the scrap.\n\nAssuming the blank back does not show itself I would be open to other NY Natl print anomalies and error cards/scraps \n\nShoot me an email [url]maxjcards@gmail.com[/url] and let's talk \n\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/MtG6NKF.jpeg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/69xAVax.jpeg[/IMG]\n\nFull size images here\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/kyEfVgZ.jpeg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/qRrIwHK.jpeg[/IMG]",
