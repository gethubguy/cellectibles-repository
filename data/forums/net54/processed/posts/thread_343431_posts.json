Send PM please.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdited to add - looking to pay $40-$50 per card, assuming the T206 isn't totally trashed.  Will pay more for star cards.  Yes, there are many on ebay, but all are priced a bit high for what they are.  Fleabay sales are all over the price range.  There are many sales in the range (or less) what I'm offering and that doesn't take into consideration the ebay fees the seller pays for the sale. Thanks for the offers received so far.",
