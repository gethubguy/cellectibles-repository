If interested in discussing, shoot me a PM. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m putting together a binder set so condition isn\u2019t important to me as long as not trimmed. Thanks for looking. \r\n\r\nChris",

I f we can work something out for them, I'd also consider Leifield and Hinchman.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nDoug",
