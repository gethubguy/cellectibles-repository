    "post_content": "I would like to acquire a really sharp Evers blue sky in SGC 4 to 5. My requirements are bold color, sharp image, good corners and bright borders.  Basically a really strong example of the card; likely graded fairly recently at SGC. Not interested in any PSA graded. I won't even consider them due to the cross-over process. Backs are not of interest to me so Piedmont or SC are fine.  Shown below are just a few examples of cards I have to trade and what qualities I would be looking for in the Evers card. I am willing to give someone a bit over value in trade for the right card. Nothing shown here is for sale, only for trading towards an Evers. In order for a trade to work, you should be an active longer term member, not a recent sign up, that is willing to trade contact info.\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/PmC2lvql.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/sRYChIdl.jpg[/img][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/Ds3i6r3l.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/WK8Erpwl.jpg[/img][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/wIt5z4rl.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/iFK8731l.jpg[/img][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/jv1WhEil.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/RHWQou4l.jpg[/img][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/wj1Qshtl.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/OcaeOYQl.jpg[/img][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/EhBq8FIl.jpg[/img][/IMG][IMG][img]https://i.imgur.com/tMzVCpdl.jpg[/img][/IMG]",
