    "post_content": "I am looking for an SGC graded Ty Cobb Green Portrait.\r\n\r\nAuthentic graded to probably a 2.5 is in my price range.\r\n\r\nSweet Cap or Piedmont back is preferred, mainly to keep overall cost down and the project I'm working on, the back will not be shown.\r\n\r\nI am open to trading or buying at this point in my search.\r\n\r\nMain trade bait would be more modern sports, but I do have a PSA 2 Nap Lajoie Portrait to put towards the overall cost of the Cobb.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help and/or leads!!!\r\n\r\n~Joe",

Packaging was A+ as well.\r\n\r\nThanks Frank!!!",
