So looking to sell for $450 or trade toward a graded 3~4.5 AB 460 HOFer or an Old Mill HOFer portrait in the 3~4.5 range. Would also consider raw HOFers or SL guys in G-VG range.\n\nIf a cash buyer comes before a trade is ironed out, that takes it, but would prefer trading.\n\n\n\nThanks,\nBob\nPM or email at\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
