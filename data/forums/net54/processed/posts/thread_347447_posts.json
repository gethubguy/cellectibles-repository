    "post_content": "Hey all,\nThis guy doesn\u2019t blend in with my VG-VGEX HOFers so would like to use him as trade bait or to get some cash to find a VG-VGEX Hindu HOFer.\n\nLooks like there are 2 PSA 5\u2019s and this one has better centering than the other one that I was able to find a pic of. Also has a touch of wet sheet transfer.\n\nPrice $2650 or we can work on a trade for or toward a VG or VGEX Hindu HOFer (preferably a Portrait, but open).\n\nThanks,\nBob\n\nEmail:\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
