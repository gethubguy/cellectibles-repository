I might have some trading stock if you are looking for one of the other poses.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have a nice one, pretty well centered, since I\u2019ll be looking at it on the wall. A fun back would be a bonus, but not required as I\u2019d just love to finally get these on the wall!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBob\r\n Current lineup:",
