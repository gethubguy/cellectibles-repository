    "post_content": "Looking to either sell, trade, trade/cash my raw Cy Young bare hand. Nice big borders, good coloring and registration. It has a Sweet Cap 350/30 reverse. At one time it must\u2019ve had a stamp of some sort affixed to it as it has remanants still on the card along with a little paper loss where someone tried removing whatever was affixed. Overall, it presents well. $775.00 cash or willing to look at T206 HOF off backs in trade. If interested, please shoot me a PM and I\u2019ll email or text you pictures. I\u2019m not super proficient with posting images on this site. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nJohn",
