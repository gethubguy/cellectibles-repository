Just looking for a bio on the card, if any, how long you\u2019ve had the card and images front and back of the card to repost with your consent for the online error collection. Thanks and check out @t206er for a feel of what  I am looking for : misprints, miscuts, multistrike, multiprint, ghosts, wet sheet transfers, underprints, color variations, printer scraps, blank backs, upside down backs, proofs and whatever else you got!",
