    "post_title": "Reduced 206 Piedmont 350/25 Ty Cobb Bat on Shoulder PSA 4",
    "post_author_name": "benedini",
    "post_content": "This one has great colors and overall image quality front and back. Pretty decent centering, little wear on all corners (worse top left), tiny edge wear showing on top of back, and 6mm surface wrinkle (front only) on border just above and right of Cobb's hands. Nice eye appeal on this one overall - $SOLD including express delivery or 3% discount for Zelle/FF/check. \n\nNew seller to here - member for past 18 months - and have purchased items from a few of you before and made a couple successful sales here now. Just selling off a part of my collection and a few others I've picked up here and there as I have a slightly different focus now (changes often). eBay user ID is megalodonteeth so you can see feedback.  Thanks for looking - Steve\n\nPotentially interested in partial/full trade for T3 Turkey Reds I don't have with strong appeal.",
