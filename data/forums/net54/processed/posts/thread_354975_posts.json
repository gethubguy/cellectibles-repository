The card has a small tear near the top left corner (see pics) that doesn\u2019t really distract from its great eye appeal for the technical grade. \n\nAsking $450 net to me (including shipping) but will entertain reasonable offers. \n\nThanks!\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20241109/f7dd9462ca834199687a5fe0102dc070.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20241109/2acfb64227335075894771422eb2e8e3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20241109/9d4aa6d1c0f706e8aad7f0a322c842a7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20241109/07d3fe51eba7a39cce7bb0e43c5f97e1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20241109/61dd9b1c781c798e31a162d2951a47b7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
