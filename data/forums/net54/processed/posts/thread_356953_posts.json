    "post_content": "Hello all -\r\n\r\nI still have a nice availability of raw T206 and T205 commons (and minor stars and I think one HOF in this group) available for sale - these are cross-posted across other platforms but wanted to post here too.\r\n\r\nI hope this attachment works - too many photos to include (several dozens of cards).  99% of the backs are SC other than the Cycle Back cards at the front end of these.\r\n\r\nAny card here where the price is in WHITE letters is available at the time I am posting this - PM me with any questions or claims.\r\n\r\nHappy browsing - I think you'll find some nice ones in here!\r\n\r\nJeff",
