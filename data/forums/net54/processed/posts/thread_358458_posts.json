    "post_content": "Doing a little cleaning up of doubles and had forgotten I still had this one from a failed all PSA 1 set build (don't worry, I did build an all PSA 2-520 and my 522 still is in tact!).  \r\n\r\nTy Cobb - Bat off Shoulder Piedmont 350-460 factory 25 PSA 1\r\n\r\nPresents reasonably well for the grade.  \r\n\r\nAsking $2,850 net of any fees.  Paypal, venmo, check, money orders are all fine. Allow time to clear if mailing payments.  Shipment will be via registered mail.\r\n\r\nFeel free to message me with any questions or to discuss the purchase.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I do have another 20-25 PSA 1s as well as some PSA 2s left over I'm happy to discuss as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
