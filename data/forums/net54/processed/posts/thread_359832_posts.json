    "post_content": "I have a T206 John Titus Sweet Caporal 350/30 PSA 4 to trade for another very hard to find T206 card (or back) that I don't have. I am new to T206 and don't have much, yet. \n\n[url]https://imgur.com/a/wg8PHo9[/url] \n\nSince I am new here, I am open to sending first to an established member (if that is what it takes) who can be vouched for by Leon, who has my number, and has recently spoken with me by phone.\n\nAs a point of reference, my eBay ID is the same name with 100% feedback (mostly as a buyer). I also have flawless feedback on MacRumors forum (same name and 12+ year active member with 36,000 posts) with selling $500-$1400+ items via PPG with no problems, if that matters to anyone here. \n\nI would enjoy making a deal with a fellow enthusiast on the forum.",
