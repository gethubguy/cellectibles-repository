    "post_content": "Trying to find some focus in my collection. \n\nLooking for PSA slabs in the 3-5 range. Ideally cards will have great registration, and be crease/wrinkle-free. I also steer away from diamond-cut cards. Centering isn\u2019t paramount, but 30-70 or better is preferred. Rounded corners are okay! Dings, minor stains / paper loss probably aren\u2019t dealbreakers. \n\nI only have about 50 PSA slabs, so there\u2019s a lot out there I\u2019m still searching for - more so interested in \u201cgood\u201d players (~15 WAR and up). Will consider selling as well. \n\nGrade / condition wish list becomes more negotiable if you\u2019re bringing a rarity or something like a Mathewson to the prospective deal. \n\nSGC:\n\nDahlen Boston 30 (2.0) - Piedmont 150 - $190 > $165\n[strike]White portrait 3.5 - Piedmont 150[/strike]\n[STRIKE]Powell 40 (3.0) - Piedmont 150[/STRIKE]\n[strike]Lundgren KC 55 (4.5) - Piedmont 350[/strike]\n[strike]Speaker 2.0 - Piedmont 350[/strike]\n[strike]Doyle portrait 4.0 - Piedmont 460/25[/strike]\n\n[STRIKE]Turner 40 (3.0) - Sweet Cap 150/30[/STRIKE]\n[strike]Lajoie portrait 1.5 - Sweet Cap 350/30[/strike]\n\n[strike]F.
