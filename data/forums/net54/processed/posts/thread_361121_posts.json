    "post_content": "Two very cool factory Diamond Cut cards.\r\n\r\nFrank Chance (HOF) SC 350-460 Factory 42 - Lower Pop - Yellow Portrait \r\n\r\nThis card is a beautiful example of a Diamond Cut WITH Wet Sheet Transfer of red back ink on the front of the card.  Likely a 1 of 1 for this issue.  The 350-460/42 back shows a total Pop of all grades by PSA of only 30 examples. (SGC doesn't differentiate).\r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\nChick Gandil (Black Sox Scandal - His Lifetime Ban lifted just yesterday!) Piedmont 350-460/25\r\n\r\nOnce again a great Diamond Cut example with near-perfect centering!  Great color!\r\n\r\nSOLD. \r\n\r\nPayPal, Venmo or Zelle no-fee accepted\r\nTons of Vouches available\r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
