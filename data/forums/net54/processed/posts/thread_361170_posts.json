This particular card is not one you see very often in PSA 5 or better. $1100 with signature delivery required. Payment via PayPal gift or PayPal G&S and you pay the 4% fee. As soon as payment is made and clears, I will ship and provide tracking information the same day.  Click on the link for pictures. \r\n\r\nSelling board reference since I have been a member: Andrew T206. He paid PPG and was pleased with the T206 Titus transaction. \r\n\r\nMacRumors forum - Been an active member for almost 13 years with several thousands of dollars in sales and all with A+ feedback. Most recent was a 2024 MacBook Pro for $1100 via PPG. \r\n\r\nIf interested, please send me a PM and I will get right back with you. \r\n\r\n[url]https://imgur.com/a/dIQv3KC[/url]",
