    "post_content": "Very nice mid-grade (high-grade for the Polar Bear back really) T206 Ty Cobb (Bat off Shoulder) SGC 4. Great colors, very nice centering, and that gorgeous dark blue back. Mild corner wear and typical tobacco stains that are common on these\n\nSGC population of 6 with only 5 graded higher. If you include PSA graded cards there are only 9 that grade higher than this and I doubt there's even a few at most that have this eye appeal. \n\n$SOLD Thank you.",
