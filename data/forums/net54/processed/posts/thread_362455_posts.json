Mix of raw & graded - but similar - high eye appeal front / lower grade.  Also have a 514 set (no cobbs or demmitt or ohara) in lower/beater grade (and an additional 200 or so other t206). Got caught up in completing the monster (almost twice), but am switching focus to what I find most interesting about the set - backstamps, miscuts, oddities, etc, and associated tobacco packs. Not listed anywhere else for now, but will likely end up posted on facebook groups, too.",
