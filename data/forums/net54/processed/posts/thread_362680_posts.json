I prefer Paypal ff. \r\nThanks for looking, Robert\r\n\r\nThese cards are cross posted . \r\n\r\nPSA 3.5 Addie Joss Old Mill $1200 - PSA must have graded this one with their eyes closed. Multiple surface scuffs. Pop 1 with 1 higher, but it should be a 2 or 2.5 at best.\r\n\r\nPSA 2 Ed Walsh EPDG $1100 - Could be viewed as over graded with the rounded corners and crease in upper front left.\r\n\r\nPSA 3 Miller Huggins American Beauty $900 - Pop 2, total pop 9.",
