Mostly a binder set of quality raw cards mixed with Graded 1s - 4s \r\n\r\nOn the advice of Cory Robinson (one of the greatest dudes in this space BTW) I started with some of the more difficult cards to find and now have just a few HOFers left, which are always available somewhere, just a matter of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCobb, Ty (Portrait - Green)\r\nCobb, Ty (Bat On Shoulder)\r\nJohnson, Walter (Portrait)\r\nTinker, Joe (Bat Off Shoulder)\r\n\r\nDemmitt, Ray (St. Louis Amer.)\r\nO'Hara, Bill (St. Louis)\r\n\r\n\r\nFive of these six will require me to save and reload between purchases, but right now that Tinker is just low hanging fruit. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has a decent Tinker , Bat Off , hit me up. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\nPS - always buying Tom Downey batting and Fielding",
