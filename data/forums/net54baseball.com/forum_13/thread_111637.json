I have need about 80 T206's and only have 27 T205's so if you have T205's to trade, I probably need them.  Like cards are fine and I can trade multiple cards for single cards if needed.  Email me with any questions you might have.\n\n[IMG]http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee112/tycobb1909/trade1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee112/tycobb1909/trade2.jpg[/IMG]",
