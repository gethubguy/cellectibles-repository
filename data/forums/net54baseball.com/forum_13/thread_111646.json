I also have other items for sale in the post-war and memorabilia categories, so check those out if you think you might be interested. Sorry the photos aren't a little better, I had to use a camera instead of a scanner. I'll give discounts for purchases of more than one item. I prefer Paypal, but I'll take a check or M.O. if you'd rather. All prices include shipping. I'll sell the pair for $62 shipped.\n\n1921 Neilson's Chocolate &quot;Deacon&quot; Sam Jones--New York Americans VG-Ex \n\n$25\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/jonesfront.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/jonesback.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n\n\n\n1941 Play Ball Joe Cronin misprinted back--Ralston Hemsley upside-down back VG\n$45\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/croninfront.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/croninback.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]",
