      "post_content": "I am thinking about parting with my T206 collection.  I want to sell as one group.  If I get the right price, I will part with it.  I am looking to raise some quick cash, so don't want to take the time to sell individually.\n\nI have 214 graded T206s.  The breakdown is:\n\n2 - SGC70\n12 - SGC60\n194 - SGC50\n2 - SGC40\n1 - PSA5\n3 - PSA4\n\nThere is 10 HOFers and 6 Southern Leaguers.  I don't have any scans yet.\n\nI can email you a spreadsheet of what I have if anyone is interested.  Price is negotiable.  Email me if you have any interest.\n\nThanks!",

I continue to waffle.\n\nSo, that being said, if anyone is still interested, I will re-think any legitimate offers.  I am willing to come down a little from my initial $15,000 price tag.\n\nAgain, anyone interested and I can send you a complete checklist of what I have.  Again, no scans yet as I might own one of the worst scanners in the world.\n\nEmail me if you are interested.  I have added 2 more commons since my initial post in SGC50, so the total now is 216 graded cards.\n\nThanks,\nPhil\n\nP.S. Again, I am not willing to break up.  If I sell it, I will only sell the entire collection as one.",
