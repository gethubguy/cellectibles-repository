Anyway, There are over 210 cards graded SGC 50 and above with the following key cards and Hall of Famers. Cards can be seen on the Sgc registry under \"Long Strange Trip\" or if this link works...\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=239&userset=2121[/url]\n\n\nSgc 60\n\nBaker\nBeckley\nBender (portrait)\nBrown (cubs)\nChance (batting)\nChance (red)\nChase (dark cap)\nCollins (Jimmy)\nCollins (Eddie)\nCobb (bat on)\nDuffy\nGriffith (portrait)\nGreiminger\nJohnson (portrait)\nKleinow (Boston)\nLajoie (bat)  Piedmont 42\nLajoie (throwing)\nMarquard (hands at hips)\nMathewson (white cap)\nScott (Carolina Brights)\nYoung (glove shows)\n\nSGC 70\n\nEvers (w/bat)\nMathewson (dark cap)\nMcgraw (no cap)\nWalsh\nWheat\nYoung (bare hand)\n\nOther cards included are\n\nShappe\nChase (white cap) Sgc 88\n7 sgc 80's\nA bunch of Sgc 50 Hall of Famers, Piedmont 42s, and tough commons.\n\nA great way to get a jump on a Vg/x to Ex T206 set.

That list is contains about 50 cards now, but I will pare it down to around 20. If the card you want is on that list, make an offer if you like.  Shipping and handling included. If using paypal, please add 3%. Thanks again for your patience.
