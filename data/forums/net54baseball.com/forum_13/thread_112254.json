I go in order of e-mails received and you would have received a scan if the first two folks passed.  I understand your point about posting scans and will do that soon.  I also get scans out fast but do go in the order of requests.  Anyone can return a card that they have bought from me without an issue.  I have not had a single issue on this site and have done quite a few transactions.  Good luck in your pursuits.",
