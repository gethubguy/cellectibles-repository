I am after all PSA cards for two reasons - firstly I want to display the cards at home so they'll all match, and secondly I don't want to send in cards for grading and spend big $$ for the previlege of international delivery.\n\nSend me an email at [url]bcd@boxingcarddigest.com[/url] if you have anything available.\n\n  Brown, George    Batting \n  Brown, Mordecai  Cubs on shirt \n  Brown, Mordecai  Portrait \n  Chance, Frank    Batting \n  Chance, Frank    Red Portrait \n  Evers, Johnny    Cubs on shirt \n  Evers, Johnny    Portrait \n  Hofman, Solly    Batting \n  Howard, Del    Batting \n  Lundgren, Carl    Ready to Throw \n  Moran, Pat    Seated \n  Needham, Tom    Catching \n  Pfeister, Jake    Throwing \n  Reulbach, Ed    Glove Showing \n  Schulte, Wildfire  Front View \n  Schulte, Wildfire  Back view \n  Sheckard, Jimmy  Pitching \n  Steinfeldt, Harry  Portrait \n  Tinker, Joe    Bat off Shoulder \n  Tinker, Joe    Bat on Shoulder \n  Tinker, Joe    Hands on Knees \n  Tinker, Joe    Portrait",
