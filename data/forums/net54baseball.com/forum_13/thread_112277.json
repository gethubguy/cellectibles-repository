The card is in great shape with very slight corner touches and a small crease from the left border to his cheek.  The cards front and back are both bright and clean with a perfectly focused image.  As one of the \"big 4\" the condition is excellent for the given numerical grade and one of the best looking examples on the market.  With the purchase of this card registered shipping will be free to the new owner.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.  Asking $12,500.00 or your best offer\n\n[IMG]http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x63/Captainhask/MagieFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x63/Captainhask/MagieBack.jpg[/IMG]",
