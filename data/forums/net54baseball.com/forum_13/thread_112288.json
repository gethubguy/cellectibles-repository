      "post_content": "Thanks for the kind words. My Hindu Pack is dated 1908 so is a year before the cards would have come in it. I don't know what it's worth exactly but I would guess about $200, as it is still very rare.  The Hindu Young I picked up from a board member about a year or so ago. I always wanted a Young Portrait and the back just added to the flavor.....it's one of my favorite T206's.....take care",
