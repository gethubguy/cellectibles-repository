      "post_content": "I am selling a large number of t205s (90 now, more later).  Included are, commons, stars, HOFers, variations, Short Prints.\n\nThere are a few graded ones which are duplicates from my personal collection.    Each card is priced individually and reasonably.  I will not charge a lot for shipping.  $3 flat fee.  Add 3% for paypal.  \n\n\n[URL=\"http://imageevent.com/ltsgallery/memberfoldersko/mrc32/forsale\"]Here is the link to the imageevent gallery[/URL]\n\nEmail me at mrc32 @ insightbb.com.  I will take the first request for the card.\n\nThis sale is perfect for t205 collectors, team collectors, etc.\n\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD:\nI am now asking $2050 for the lot.\n\nI have added 10 new commons, all higher grade (scroll down to the bottom).\n\nI will also add in 11 lower grade t205 (one of which is Hugh Jennings).\n\nThis is a nice lot with 7 HOFers, SPs and Variations.\n\nLMK",
