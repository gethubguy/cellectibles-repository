      "post_content": "I continue to waffle about my decision of whether to sell my T206 collection or not.  One day it is not for sale, the next it is for sale again.  I pulled back from my post of a week or two ago and now feel again, that I will sell my set for the right price.\n\nI have also come down a little from my initial asking price.  Email me if you would like a spreadsheet of what I have and my \"NEW\" asking price.  I don't have any scans yet, as I might own one of the worst scanners in the world and it took me hours just to scan a few cards recently.\n\nMy set breaks down as follows:\n\nI have 216 graded T206s\n\n2 - SGC70\n12 - SGC60\n196 - SGC50\n2 - SGC40\n1 - PSA5\n3 - PSA4\n\nThere are 10 HOFers and 6 Southern Leaguers.\n\nI am not breaking up the set at all.  It's either 216 or nothing.  I will not sell individual cards.\n\nThanks,\nPhil",
