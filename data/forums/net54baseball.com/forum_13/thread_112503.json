      "post_content": "Shooting himself in the foot, but at least trying to be honest, the Old Prof notes that this is the most overgraded 4 in PSA history.  The mark referred to may be a faint pencil trace over Keefe's face, or it may be a small \"O\" under the R in \"CIGARETTES\" on the reverse.\n\nIn addition, some vandal took cut into the top part of the card, leaving a deep scratch about a quarter inch down from the top, running parallel to the edge.\n\nNonetheless, it is what it is.  Asking $150.\n\nFRIDAY AFTERNOON-- CARD HAS BEEN SOLD.  THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST.",
