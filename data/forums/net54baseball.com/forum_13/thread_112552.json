SOLD\n\nThe card now resides in an SGC 30 holder, but I have been unable to scan it in the holder because my HP all-in-one printer is apparently on sabbatical.  The little bastard is spewing out error messages left and right.\n\nThe card has a wrinkle/crease that runs from his left ear to just above his hat that is not visible in the scan.  A 2nd crease that runs between the \"G\" and \"I\" in Giants is somewhat visible in the scan.  I suppose due to the dark color of the card, neither crease detracts much from the card's beauty.\n\nmy email:  [url]boboinnes33@gmail.com[/url]",
