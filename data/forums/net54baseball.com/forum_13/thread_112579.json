Thanks also need to go to Joe, who let me in on the fact he has one more, and it will also soon be on its way to me.\nI've told Leon, and many others, that examples like this are why this board is so great. Its not just the knowledge of everyone here, it is the willingness to keep an eye out for others, let them know when things they have been looking for are available, and in this extreme case, stepping in to make sure they get it. Everyone on this board is great, and I really appreciate all the help I get from everyone on my quest.\nSincerely, Ed",
