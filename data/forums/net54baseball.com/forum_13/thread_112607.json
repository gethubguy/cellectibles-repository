      "post_content": "I have a card that is a bit unusuall to say the least.  It is a T206 Snodgrass with the name in red ink.  Does anyone know anything about this type of variation.  From what I have heard there are many variations of T206's.  This card checks out in comparison and uniformity to other T206's I have.  There is no eveidence of alteration under a loupe or blacklight.  Just looking for some feedback about the card and a value if possible.",

If it were a bright red, and not altered, then I think you would have something special. Most folks are looking for the \"S\" to be almost gone, which is the well known (s)nodgrass variation.",

Is is common for the names to be in brown ink and fade???  All 46 of my other T206's are as black as can be even the crappiest of them.  Kind like my Revelle with the OM back.  It looked dark brown but under a loupe you could see it was just faded out.  My luck though.",
