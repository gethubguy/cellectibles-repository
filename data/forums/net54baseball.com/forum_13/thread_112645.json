      "post_content": "Looking to unload on this toughy.  For those that were following me when I was selling off my T222s to buy the land next our home, it has become a reality!  :)  My family is very excited to be able to invest in this land and to have more room for my girls to play on.  However, this last card will help finish things off.  \n\nThis is a tough Leibold card to begin with, let alone have it autographed by the man.  Leibold died in 1977. Much like Bob Feller, he was happy to pass along his autograph to those who wanted it.  It's not a great looking auto since he wrote in pen on photo paper, but it is his signature.  This card generally sells for a few hundred since it is a high numbered SP, so I am looking to get $425 for the card.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you all!\n\nJimi\n**see attachment**",
