Great color and eye appeal.\n\nThomas SGC 40 - $250 - light wear to each of the corners, 3 small spots of white to the right of his glove, very light stain at top right edge, bottom edge looks to have been pushed against SGC black insert and damage is only noticable on front, very light crease starting at bottom middle edge and goes inbetween  the words \"Thomas\" and \"Phila.\".  The picture I took shows a bunch of flash reflections that are NOT on the card, so I included the scan from the seller I got the card from.\n\nAny questions, please ask!\nThanks,\nRob\n:o)",
