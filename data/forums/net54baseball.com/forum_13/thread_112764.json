      "post_content": "Frank's recent \"BST auction\" gave me an idea:  Let's try a True Dutch Auction --- I will start these cards at a price, and lower that price 5% per day, until someone buys them (just email me when you want to buy).  This daily reduction will probably occur early afternoon (EDT :)), but that may vary.  Final price will include s/h/i, and paypal, check, or mo accepted.\n\nThis should be straight forward ;), but will see as we go :confused:\n\nT212-1 -- Ort -- SGC 40\n\nStarting price on other thread:  $200 -- didn't sell.\n5-30-09:  $190 -- didn't sell.\n5-31-09:  $180.50  -- didn't sell (&^%#$, should have accecpted $190 offero on ebay, oh well)\n6-1-09:  $171.48 -- didn't sell.\n6-2-09:  $162.91\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=979&d=1243707848[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=980&d=1243707866[/IMG]\n\n\n\nT212-1 -- Ragan -- SGC 40\nStarting price on other thread:  $225 -- didn't sell.\n5-30-09:  $213.75 -- didn't sell.\n5-31-09:  $203.06 -- didn't sell.\n6-1-09:  192.91 -- didn't sell.\n6-2-09:  $183.26\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=981&d=1243707879[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=982&d=1243707893[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nMan, this might come back and bite me in the a$$ :eek:, but I will NOT stop until sold.\n\n\nFun, Fun, Scott",
