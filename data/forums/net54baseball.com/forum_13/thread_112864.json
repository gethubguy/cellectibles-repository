      "post_content": "One of the more desireable cards from the later series, the Hyames is a toughie to find for sure. Terrific looking pose, one of the more popular ones from the t210 sets as well. Conditionwise, the card has some corner wear but no significant wear or other damage. No wrinkling or creases exist anywhere on the card and the back is clean and damage free. Asking $365 or would trade for t210 orange borders or anything else from my wantlist.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1076&d=1243988669[/IMG]",
