Certainly one of the more unique poses in the T206 set - you just gotta love the solid black \"KC\" moniker on the solid black uniform! $150.00 delivered.\n \nFirst person to send an e-mail to [URL=\"sschris@att.net\"]sschris@att.net[/URL] committing to make purchase (\"I'll take it\") is the new owner. Good luck!\n \nThanks,\nSteve C.",
