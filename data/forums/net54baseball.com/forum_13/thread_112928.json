      "post_content": "For auction is this T206 white border tobacco card of Frank Isbell. It is a Sweet Caporal series 150 factory 30 card. Isbell had over 1000 hits in the majors, and a 4-7 record when he pitched, with a 3.59 ERA. The Bald Eagle played in over 1100 games, had 253 career stolen bases, swiping 52 in 1901. He was with the White Sox World Champions of 1906.\n\nThe card has a diagonal crease from his right elbow down through his glove. Nice color and registry, a clean and well centered back.\n\nI'll let you guys bid on it for a while. If/when it gets up to where I'm willing to let it sell, I'll contact the high bidder to let them suggest a convenient closing day and time for him. I'll post that day and time, and clearly state the time zone. Then the auction will close at that time so long as there have been no bids in the preceding 5 minutes. \n\nBid in any increment you wish. High bid wins, even if a penny more. Shipping is $2.50 for 1st class with delivery confirmation, or I'll ship any way you wish for about what it costs. Payment by Paypal if you wish, or USPS money order. I'll take a check but may wait for it to clear.\n\nIf you're complaining about the auction style, or auctions in general, please do it somewhere else, on the main board. I don't mind the bashing, but it isn't fair to interfere with the auction. Thanks.\n\nFrank Wakefield\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=17&pictureid=577[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=17&pictureid=578[/IMG]",
