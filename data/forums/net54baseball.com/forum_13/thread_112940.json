      "post_content": "I have BCW toploaders 10 per pack w/sleeves and Pro-Mold screwdowns for single tobacco cards.  I do sell these on Ebay but would like to see if anyone would like to buy them here.  \n\nThe cost is:\n\n $1.75 per toploader 10pk\n\n$1.50 per screwdown.\n\nShipping is $2 for the first item then $1 per item after.  If you buy larger amounts over 10 pks I will cut shipping down because it goes into a priority box.\n\nDo not reply to this thread as I don't want it to  keep being bumped to the top.  I will do that about once a week.  Please send me an email to\nPup6913@hotmail.com with amount you are requesting.\n\nThanks \n\nAndrew",
