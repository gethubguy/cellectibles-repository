Here is a huge list and they are priced to sell.  Don't forget that 2010 is also the 100 year anniversary for the T3 set.  Prices have come down on these recently, but I am doubtful that they will stay down.  This is a long list so I didn't post scans, but I am happy to send scans and/or descriptions on any of them.  Please email me at [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url] with anything you need.  Thanks in advance!\n\nSeveral have sold since this list first went up - thanks to all who have inquired and bought - and there are some absolutely beautiful cards still available.  These are quality cards, ask for scans and take a look.  I am ready to sell these, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks again!\n\n\nBergen       PSA-5      $825\nLeach        PSA-5    $1000       No-ad back - graded years ago - should be 5.5+ easy\nChase       PSA-4 $750\nCamnitz    PSA-4.5    $625\nDevlin      PSA-4.5      $625\nDevlin  PSA-1(MK)  $225 - No-ad back\nDooin       PSA-4        $450\nJordan    PSA-4                 $525\nKrause     PSA-4                $500\nMcIntyre  PSA-2                $250          Brooklyn\nMcIntyre   PSA-5MK           $350            B& C\nMConnell  PSA-1  $225 - No-ad back\nMullin        PSA-4.5           $ 625\nSallee      PSA-5              $875\nWiltse       PSA-4              $475\nSafe At 3rd  PSA-2             $400\nClose Play   PSA-2             $350\nAmes          PSA-4             $475           Checklist\nBescher       PSA-4            $ 550           Checklist\nBrowne        PSA-5             $825            Checklist\nCovaleski    PSA-3             $350            Checklist\nCovaleski   PSA-2            $225 ad-back\nCriger  SGC-40  $350  ad-back\nDoolan         PSA-5             $875            Checklist\nDoolin          PSA-4MK       $1200           Ad-back\nDoolin   PSA-1     $700   ad-back\nDowney       PSA-4             $500           checklist\nDygert PSA-5  $775  checklist\nDygert         PSA-4             $475           checklist\nGroom          PSA-5              $875           ad-back\nHoblitzell       PSA-4            $ 500           checklist\nHofman         PSA-5            $ 825            ad-back\nKling            PSA-4MK         $325            ad-back\nKonetchy      PSA-4              $550           ad-back - graded years ago - should be 4.5+ easy\nLobert           PSA-5             $850            checklist\nNiles              PSA-2            $175             ad-back\nPaskert         PSA-3            $325              C&P -ad-back\nSchulte         PSA-4MK       $275              ad-back\nSchulte   PSA-1  $150  checklist\nStreet            PSA-3            $325              adback\nStreet  PSA-2  $225  ad-back\nSullivan         PSA-4.5         $ 650              checklist\nSullivan  PSA-3  $325 checklist\nTenney          PSA-4            $450              NY - checklist\nThomas        PSA-4             $425              adback\nWilson          PSA-2             $350              adback\n\nI have several ungraded as well - they are all authentic, etc - just haven't been sent in because they have a pinhole and will grade PSA-1.
