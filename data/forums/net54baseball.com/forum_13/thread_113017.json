      "post_content": "...to sell you, but in terms of price, I usually go by the general price line for no-name/not special commons:\n\nSGC 10 - $10 - $15\nSGC 20 - $20 - $25\nSGC 30 - $25 - $35\nSGC 40 - $35 - $40\nSGC 50 - $45 - $50\nSGC 60 - $70 - $90\n\nThings have been somewhat recessed, so to speak, over the last year or two.  Sometimes you can do better than these prices, but I think they're probably a safe range.\n\nGood luck!",
