      "post_content": "I have a pair of nice 1909 Obaks - Browning and Williams available.  Both exhibit very little wear.  Browning has some mild staining on the back and Williams has a crease in the upper left corner.  Both cards are free from damage on either side.  Asking $170 apiece which was roughly my cost for each card when purchased.
