      "post_content": "Looking for a T200 Fatima Team card for a Type collection. I'm looking to spend between $125-$200 depending on the card. I would prefer a low grade SGC (20 or 10) but raw is ok. I will consider any card, but I'm fishing for a Cleveland or Phila. American card because then I could also cross Plank or Jackson off of a player list (yeah, it's iffy but the wife has us saving for a house so I'm cutting corners). I've checked Ebay and most offered are 30's to 50's and I'm not as interested in grade as I am checking it off the list.\n[url]sbfinley.mac@gmail.com[/url] \n\nP.S. If you hand deliver the card like Nashville Baseball (Jeremy) did and I answer the door while I'm hung over from the night before in my boxers I'll add 10%. Really embarrassing but it happens. The life of a barkeep.",
