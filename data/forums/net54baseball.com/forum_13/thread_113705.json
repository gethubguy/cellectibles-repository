      "post_content": "For sale is this graphically beautiful Turkey Red cigarette Box.  This box is complete with an unbroken spine and full back tax stamp.  The box is not crushed in any way and aside from the scuff to the front cover, grades EX-NM.\n\nWhile I would not classify Turkey Red boxes as rare, they are difficult to find and I can't recall the last one I saw for sale besides this one.  Would display nicely with a T3.\n\nSOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/TRfront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/TRback.jpg[/IMG]",
