      "post_content": "Hello, I am working on the T206 set. I am looking to buy a grouping of cards, preferably 20 or more per deal. Once I get down to a hundred or so needed cards, I will look for individuals rather than group lots. I am not concerned about condition. I am looking for cards that would grade between Poor to EX. Please email me at [url]bucklercards@yahoo.com[/url] if you have any available. Thanks, Chris",
