      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nUp for sale is a very nice T206 Brown Hindu Jack Powell graded an SGC 40. As you can see from the scan, the card is slightly miscut at the top border. However, the scan will also attest to how incredibly sharp the corners are on this card. If not for the miscut, this is almost definitely a 5. The back is crisp, clean, and unblemished. There are NO CREASES in the card. Tough to find a rare back on a horizontal. I'm looking to get $400 for this spectacular card and will consider all offers.\n\ne-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://s107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/t206-powell.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://s107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/t206-powell-b.jpg[/IMG]",
