      "post_content": "I recently came across a few Drum tobacco pouches and I'm offering what I have for sale (having kept one for myself).  All of the pouches are empty and vary in condition.  However, the best part of this grouping is every single pouch dates to 1910 (original tax stamps are in tact for the most part).\n\nAs I've stated before on this board (numerous, numerous times), the Drum tobacco pouches did not contain the T205 and T206 baseball cards.  They were made by the ATC as a sister product to Drum cigarette packs (which did contain the cards).  Currently, there are no known Drum cigarette packs from the time period and only 1 Drum cigarette pack overall known to exist.  The graphics from the Drum tobacco pouch are most likely identical to that of the cigarette pack and would be a great companion piece for the cards.  Most Drum pouches that you see today date to the 1920s.  Again, these date to 1910 which puts them squarely in the T206 era.\n\nNow, while the T206museum seems to think these should sell for $10-$12k, I have priced these pouches between $10 and $50 each (including shipping), depending on condition.  Please email me at [url]jon_canfield@hotmail.com[/url] for detailed scans and pricing of the few I have.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/Drumcopy-1.jpg[/IMG]",
