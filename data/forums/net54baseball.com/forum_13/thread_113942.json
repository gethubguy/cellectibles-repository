      "post_content": "I have an original pocket schedule for the 1910 East Carolina League which is the exact year and league that the T210 Series 7 cards were made for.  Nice condition and the handwritten notes on it are from a player pictured in the series named Fred Stoehr.  $150\n\nI also have an original autographed cabinet photo (on back) of Fred Stoehr who appears in the T210 Series 7 set as well as the T209 Contentnea set.  $85\n\nThese are both from his estate.",
