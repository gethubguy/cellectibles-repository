      "post_content": "Hello.  I am making progress on my T207 set but still need over 100 cards.  I am looking to buy or preferably trade for any that I need.  I'm looking for lower grade cards, even beaters are fine.  I have the following T207's available to trade.  I also have 200+ low to low/mid-grade T206's and T205's including many HOF's and tougher cards, and a few e90-1's available to trade as well.  Please e-mail with any offers.  Thanks very much!\n\nAvailable T207's:\n\nBecker - really nice looking card, looks EX+ but appears to have some light glue residue on back\n\nCole - wavy top edge and obvious crease but nice looking otherwise\n\nDoyle - crease and some residue on back\n\nHamilton - couple of light creases and tiny dots of paper loss\n\nLatham - creases and a couple of spots of paper loss\n\nMcBride - small razor slash on left edge, nice looking card though\n\nOtto Miller - obviously low grade but SUPER tough Broadleaf backed card\n\nO'Toole - multiple creases and markings\n\nSmith - couple of creases and small dots of paper damage\n\nSteinfeldt - creasing, rounded corners and dirty/stained back\n\nWilie - very nice looking card but with some light glue residue on back",
