I also have Tobacco screwdowns if interested.  Shoot me an email @ [url]pup6913@hotmail.com[/url].  I have been asking for just sleeves for ever and they are lolly gaging around.  As soon as they come I will let the Board know\n\nAndrew",

      "post_content": "Hi Andrew!\n\nThanks for the reply, I bought a few packs of these earlier today from amazon right before you posted. Otherwise, I would have bought them from you. I think I am going to try an experiment with these. I am putting together a raw T206 set and want more protection than the 15-page ultra pro's give. I am thinking of putting my set in penny sleeves and top loaders and then placing them in 9-page sleeves. What do you think? Have you tried this?\n\nJeff",

      "post_content": "no I always put them into the sleeves and then loaders and place them in the box.  I use a deep check box and lay then on the side and they store great.  What did you pay on amazon???  I was the first person on the market to get these from BCW and now everyone has them and Pro-mold launched last summer but I strive to be the cheapest.  I found that as long as there is a little pressure on the loader they do not come out. Great idea and would love to see a pick when you are done.  Also remember I have screwdowns for these great cards now in case you have some you are skittish about leaving in a book.\n\nAndrew",
