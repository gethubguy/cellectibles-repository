Backs on these are clean and damage free as well.\n\nScans are available upon request and prices include shipping.  I'd also consider trades for items on my wantlist - d311s, 1918 Zeenuts, t210s, etc...- in case anyone was interested in going that route.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n\n\nEbinger (Wilmington) VG - mild corner wear, no wrinkling -- $135\nBeusewein (Charlotte) GD - one corner wrinkle, mild staining -- $110\nMcKeavitt (Winston Salem) GD - one corner wrinkle, mild staining -- $110",

At this point, the majority of the cards have been asked about and quite a few have sold.  I'll keep working through the emails and will finish them all by the end of tonight.\n\nThanks guys,\nBrian",
