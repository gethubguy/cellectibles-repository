I will let Mr. Goodwin give you the description, and his pics are better than what my scanner will do, so below is the link to the auction that I got it from.  If anyone wants to break me even (including my shipping both ways), I am happy to pass this one along to a board member.\n$1135 puts this one on your doorstep!\nDue to the $$ size of this one and me looking to break even PAYPAL will need 3% added on.\nPaperloss on the back is the biggest defect.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\nOriginal auction link:\n[url]http://www.goodwinandco.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=8287[/url]\n\nMy scans:\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Current/?action=view&current=T206BrownHinduMathewsonFront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Current/T206BrownHinduMathewsonFront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Current/?action=view&current=T206BrownHinduMathewsonBack.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Current/T206BrownHinduMathewsonBack.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
