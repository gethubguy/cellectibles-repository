Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $75 delivered.\n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\nHere's future Yankee and Red Sox \"Million Dollar Outfield\" member Duffy Lewis in his only Obak appearance.\n\nCard grades Good with a heavy horizontal crease and the other edge and corner wear you'd expect.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3795&d=1249043893[/IMG]",
