      "post_content": "After selling about half of my little stash of 1909 Obaks on the Net 54 auction venue, I'm going to try a fixed price sale. Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $75. \n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\nI'd grade this Bodie card as Fair-Good with a corner crease, rounded corners, edge wear and several areas of rubbing or abrasion that have taken off some ink on front.\n\nBodie had one of the more lengthy and distinguished major league careers among the players in Obak. He is, of course, credited with being the first player to claim, \"I didn't room with Babe Ruth, I roomed with his suitcase.\"\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3796&d=1249044152[/IMG]",
