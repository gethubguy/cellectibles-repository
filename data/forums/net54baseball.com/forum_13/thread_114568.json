      "post_content": "After selling about half of my little stash of 1909 Obaks on the Net 54 auction venue, I'm going to try a fixed price sale. Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $75.\n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\n\"Buff\" Ehman was only in the 1909 Obaks. He was on the Boston Red Sox reserve list for 1910, but never made the bigs.\n\nCard grades Very Good with corner and edge wear typical for that grade.",
