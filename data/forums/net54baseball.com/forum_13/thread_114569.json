      "post_content": "After selling about half of my little stash of 1909 Obaks on the Net 54 auction venue, I'm going to try a fixed price sale. Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $75.\n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\nCard is Very Good and is one of the handcut variety 1909 Obaks.\n\nAl \"Kit\" Carson pitched a 10-inning no-hitter against Los Angeles in July, 1909. The next season he pitched in two games for the N.L. Champion Chicago Cubs with an 0-0 record and 4.05 ERA.",
