      "post_content": "After selling about half of my little stash of 1909 Obaks on the Net 54 auction venue, I'm going to try a fixed price sale. Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $75.\n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\nCard is technically Good-Very Good. Looks EX at first glance, but has a couple of \"bends\" (not creases) visible on front, some spots of paste residue on back and a purple rubber-stamped \"23\" on back, and a bit of purple ink bleed on front left border.\n\nBrashear appeared in all three Obak sets. In 1902 he played most of the 1902 season as a utility player with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3801&d=1249045501[/IMG]",
