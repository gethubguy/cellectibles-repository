      "post_content": "After selling about half of my little stash of 1909 Obaks on the Net 54 auction venue, I'm going to try a fixed price sale. Any that remain unsold about a week from now will go to auction.\n\nPrice is $200.\n\nThe buyer will be the first person to \"claim\" the card at my price on this thread. Payment can be via PayPal, check or m.o.\n\nCard is Good with multiple creases, but no intentional damage.\n\nIt is one of only a couple horizontal format cards in 1909 Obaks (none in 1910 or 1911).\n\nFelix \"Fred\" Martinke had a lengthy minor league career out West, but never cracked a major league lineup.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3802&d=1249045927[/IMG]",
