This card was in a SGC 40 slab but the slab had a crack in it when I purchased.  I have scan to prove.  I broke it out because the crack on the slab was bothering me, believe it or not.  No creases but has what, if a modern card, i would call wax on back top and bottom.  hard to see unless card is tilted at certain angle in certain light.  White speck on bottom of back IS NOT ON THE CARD but from the scan - SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i693.photobucket.com/albums/vv298/daviddbreadman/T206/For%20Sale/T206LiebhardtSweetCaporal.jpg[/IMG]",
