PSA has graded this example a 1!\n\nAfter the National and seeing a few Cobbs ranging from $800 and up, I feel that asking $500 is reasonable! \n\nFeel free to email me at [url]tlwise12@aol.com[/url] with any inquiries!\n\n\nI'm also open to any serious offer with cash or trades (I have a HUGE wantlist available through email).\n\nThanks for looking!\nTravis",
