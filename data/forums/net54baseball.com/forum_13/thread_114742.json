I bought it last week from Quan, who acquired it via the B/S/T the week before. I bought it thinking I didn't have a Lajoie/batting with a Piedmont 350 back, but it turns out I do. So I'm offering it for the same price I paid.\n\nCheck or money order only. If I know you from the board, I will ship the card the day after we reach a deal to make up for the no-PayPal delay.\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\nwolfie51sb at aol.com",
