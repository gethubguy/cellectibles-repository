I'll add a few more dollars for delivery confirm on both, so how about if I sent 55.00 for the 2 cards? \nLMK if that works.\nThanks,\nBill\nPS:\nI'm also loking to see if I can afford the entire Cubs lot, but am disabled on a budget, things might work out. You can email me at:\n[url]bh3443@aol.com[/url] or call me at 1-508-620-7585\nRegards and God Bless,\nBill",
