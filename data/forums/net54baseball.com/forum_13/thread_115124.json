If you are not willing to sell at Fair market please do not reply.  If you want to sell some cards at what they would go for on Ebay and sorts, minus all the fees so you actually come out with more $ this way then send me a list of what you have to sell. \n\n Rare backs are welcome and I understand premium prices so I am willing to negotiate $ for those.",
