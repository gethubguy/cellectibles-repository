My main focus is the T206 cards I don't have (want list is  [URL=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tDUw9N8hA3ikwOFi2VqbvgA&output=html\"]here[/URL]), but I will trade for pretty much any pre-war cards I don't have, I collect whatever I can get my hands on cheaply.  Beaters are a-ok by me.  \n\nTrade list is [URL=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=ttNNzn8hw1T2sTtHp-1KLIA&output=html\"]here[/URL].\nScans of the T206 cards available are [URL=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/tmauchter/T206Trade?authkey=Gv1sRgCILBjJb1zK3BzQE&feat=directlink\"]here[/URL].\nScans of the T205 cards available are [URL=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/tmauchter/T205Trade?authkey=Gv1sRgCKzE7sP93vWLdQ&feat=directlink\"]here[/URL].\n\nThanks for looking.",
