Before the site switched to its new location I was in touch with someone who offered to sell me some and I had a small disaster strike in my life and couldn't follow through and buy them.  I am looking for anything anyone has from this set because I live in the area where most of the teams were based.  If anyone has anything avaliable my email is [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  You can send scans and your price request for the cards there.  Thank you for your time.  \n\nTT",
