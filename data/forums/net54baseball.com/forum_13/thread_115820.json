Putting aside the Hall of Famers, many of which I need, the signed T206 cards that I know exist that I would gladly pay at least $1,000 for are:\n\nLena Blackburne\nDonie Bush\nGavvy Cravath\nDeacon Phillippe\nNap Rucker (Pitching)\nGeorge Wiltse\nHeinie Zimmerman\n\nAnd the HOFers, for which I would go much higher, include:\n\nSam Crawford (Batting)\nRoger Bresnahan (Batting)\nFred Clarke (Portrait)\nNap Lajoie (Batting)\nTris Speaker\n\n...and of course, Ty Cobb (any and all poses)\n\nPlease let me know if you've got any to share or any leads as to where any of these can be found.  I am particularly interested in the whereabouts of any of the cards in this Mastro lot from May 2001:\n\n[url]http://www.legendaryauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=14752[/url]\n\nE-mail [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url] if you've got any info at all!",
