      "post_content": "Hello, I collect T210 Series 6's I just started and love the set because I live in kentucky.  I realize how hard they are to get and I currently have two cards.  I would really like to get a player from winchester and richmond because I was born in winchester and I went to school at EKU in richmond ky.  I would like to offer my two for trade for players from these two teams if anyone would like to trade.  I would especially like to get ahold of a Toney card from the winchester team.  If someone has one of those they are willing to trade for then I will trade both of these cards and add extra money to the deal if need be.  The two cards I have are as follows\n\nKulhman paris :very good condition light surface crease that does not run through the card on the back side.  ungraded\n\nYancey Lexington PSA graded 3.5 vg+  A very nice looking card.  If anyone is interested send scans to [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] and I will send scans of my two cards.  If you are intersted in trading and you have cards that are not from winchester or richmond I will still be happy to consider trading with anyone interested.  Thank you for your time as always\n\nTony",
