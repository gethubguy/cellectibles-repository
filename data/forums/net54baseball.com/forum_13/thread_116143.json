I'm sending you a list of the cards that I do have (I should have posted this in the first place, but I'm worried about taking up too much space). If you have any cards that I don't have I would be willing to trade. The cards without an x and a description are the cards I need. If anyone else would like a copy of the list let me know.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJoe",
