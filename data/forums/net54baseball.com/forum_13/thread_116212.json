Also any beaters that someone might have avaliable from the series 6 set I am definetly interested in. I know it is unlikely but I thought I would ask, I have two series 6 cards one psa graded, and they would be avaliable for a possible trade and cash deal if anyone is interested as well.  Thanks for all your help\n\nTony",
