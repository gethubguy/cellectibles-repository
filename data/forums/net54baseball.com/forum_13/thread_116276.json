      "post_content": "Hello, I have just started collecting this set and thanks to ebay and the kindness of some fellow board members my collection has grown from two to four and I am talking to someone about adding a fifth card possibly.  Everyone has seen my request for a series 6 Toney, that is the card I want above all others, but I would be willing to conisder trades to get one of each team represented in the set to start out with since I just started collecting. I really wanted to offer a trade because the board has been so nice to me and someone might need a specific card I have and I am just starting so as long as I get one in return that is totally cool with me.  I am really interested in Richmond and Winchester cards the most and if anyone has a toney I will trade multiple cards for that one or a card and cash for it etc.  But on to what all the T210 collectors want to know, what I have at this point.  The list is as follows:\n\n1.Yancey Lexington PSA Graded 3.5 VG+\n2.Kimbrough Lexington\n3.Keifel Lexington \n4.Kuhlman Paris\n\nJust email me about any possible deals anyone wants to make, I have scans avaliable upon request, my email is [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  And if you just want to talk about the set and the bluegrass league in general I always love to talk about it so feel free.  Thanks for your time\n\nTony",
