      "post_content": "For sale: An M. Brown error card with doubling of the portrait silhouette which causes a shadow effect. I have seen a number of ghost overprints, but this particular error appears to be somewhat different due to the darker double image. This type of error is rarely ever found on a HOF card.\n\nThe card appears to be factory cut, but is smaller side to side and longer top to bottom than a regular T206. An added bonus is that it has a Sovereign back.\n\nAsking $275 which includes shipping. Check or money orders only.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nJerry",
