I have 5 series 6 cards and I also have a Cabinet Photo of the Maysville Club from the bluegrass league covered in T210 series 6 cards.  If anyone has anything for sale or wants to propose a trade of some kind for other t210 series 6 cards they have please email me any time at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] and I will send scans of what I have to see scans of what you have if it is a trade you would be intersted in.  Thanks for your time\n\nTony",
