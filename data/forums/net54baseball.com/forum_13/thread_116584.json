Contemplating upgrades is ... well ... too much to think about.  \n\nLink to images from the set is in my signature - many of you will recognize your cards scattered throughout.  Your collective help has been great throughout this 3+ year learning experience.    Any help in closing this last hole would be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n--\nMike",
