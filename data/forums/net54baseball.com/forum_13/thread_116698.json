I'm interested in buying or purchasing those with technical grades of VG and below, especially HOF'ers. PM me if you have any. thanks in advance.",

      "post_content": "Got an extra T206 Cobb Green.  Was purchased in the 1980s as a NM card and looks every bit of that.  However, PSA says that it is trimmed even though it measures full size.  Looking at the border cuts, I suppose that I agree - heck of a nice card though.\n\nSend me a line of interested in discussing.\n\nRegards,\nScott",
