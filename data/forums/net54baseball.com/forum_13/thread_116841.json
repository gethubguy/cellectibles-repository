      "post_content": "Hello.  I have this T205 Irvin Wilhelm \"suffe ed\" variation available for trade.  This is the more common variation but still a tough card.  As you can see, it is graded a PSA 1 due to a couple of light/moderate creases and light edge and corner wear.  I believe it presents much better than the technical grade and could easily bump up a grade or so.  I am looking to trade for T207's or E90-1's.  I'm not looking to sell right now but please send me any and all trade offers.  Thanks very much.",
