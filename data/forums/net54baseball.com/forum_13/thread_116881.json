      "post_content": "I'm going to start the T206 set by building a team at a time. First up is the St. Louis Cardinals. I'm looking for raw or graded with a nice looking front. The back doesn't matter as much as these are for a display that I will be making so writing/missing paper is okay. Scans are a must. Right now I'm a little strapped for cash so if someone has a card or two available in the $20 to $30 range please let me know. Thanks! \n\nChris",
