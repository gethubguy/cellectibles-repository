I think they're a bit overpriced for how many of them are out there.  If I had them both I'd probably change my mind on how rare they are though.  ;)\n\nGood luck on the final stretch!",

Most cards have nice eye appeal and are centered pretty well.  You can see it here\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=250&userset=1174[/url]\n\nor its called Gallo's 1909 American Caramel.  Feel free to make an offer.\n\nThanks\n\nJames G",
