I'm trying to find as many different backs as I can afford (probably no Hindu, Uzit, Drum, Carolina Brights, Lenox, or Broadleaf right now) so I'd like to avoid Sweet Cap or Peidmont backs except on the Bresnahan and Willis cards.  Please let me know if you can help me. :)  Thanks!  \n\nJap Barbeau\nJack Bliss\nRoger Bresnahan Batting\nBobby Byrne\nChappie Charles\nSteve Evans\nBilly Gilbert\nEd Konetchy Glove High\nCharlie Rhodes\nAl Shaw\nVic Willis Throwing\nVic Willis Batting",
