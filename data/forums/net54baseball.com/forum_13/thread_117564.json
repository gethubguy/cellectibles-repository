      "post_content": "Hello, I have decided to focus on the winchester and richmond subset of the Series 6 T210's. They have recently cut my hours at the job I work at while I am going to school also so I need to make a few extra dollars.  I have four cards available.\n\nKimborough Lexington Excellent Condition 100.00\nKiefiel Lexington Excellent Condition 100.00\nKhulman Paris VG-EX Condition 100.00\nWomble Shelbyville VG Condition 100.00 \nAll backs on these cards are clean with no paperl oss.\n\nPrices are negotiable especially if buying more than one.  I only ask 5.00 for shipping to cover cost for paypal and shipping etc.  The 5.00 shipping is the same regardless of how many of the individual cards you buy.  I have scans avaliable just email me at  [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  I accept paypal or money order, my paypal address is [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] also.  Please email me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] if intersted and just put T210 in the message title.\nFirst person to tell me they want one or more of the cards gets the card.\n\nThanks",
