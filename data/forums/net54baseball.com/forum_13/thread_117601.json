I need to let go of a few groups of cards.\nThis is a pretty good looking group of Bears.  Great big scans for you all.\n\n$125 delivered, Paypal is fine.\nAlso looking for SOV, Cycle, AB, and SC factory 25 Eddie Collins cards as trade.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Ebay%20store/?action=view&current=T206polarbearfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Ebay%20store/T206polarbearfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Ebay%20store/?action=view&current=T206polarbearback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Ebay%20store/T206polarbearback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
