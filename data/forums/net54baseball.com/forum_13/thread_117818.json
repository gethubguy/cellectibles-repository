      "post_content": "reduced to $15 each delivered. These cards are being sold as raw. To be clear I have never submitted these cards to a grading company and do not know what grade and if they would grade.  I have owned them for 5-10 years so do not know if they were submitted prior. All have creases and corner wear.  They are my only raw T206 cards left and I am selling many of my cards.  See my photobucket site and use zoom in top right corner to see names and prices.\n\n[url]http://s693.photobucket.com/albums/vv298/daviddbreadman/?albumview=grid[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i693.photobucket.com/albums/vv298/daviddbreadman/T206TannehillRAWPiedmont350Factory2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i693.photobucket.com/albums/vv298/daviddbreadman/T206SeymourBattingRAWPiedmont150Fac.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSOLD  Gasper",
