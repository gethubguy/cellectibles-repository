      "post_content": "Hi there,\n\nFor sale is a PSA 1 T201 Huggins / Bresnahan.  Card looks better than the grade with decent corners and a clean back, but there is a small tear at the bottom (just to the left of Huggins' left foot, which is visible in the scan).\n\n$38 gets the card delivered to your door.  Paypal or check is fine.  Post here or email to [url]scooter0729@yahoo.com[/url].\n\nThanks,\nScott",
