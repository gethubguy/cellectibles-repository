Seller might not know that they are reprints....but that specific series mixed up the back colors and were printed on thicker and glossier paper stock.  From the look at the scans the cards appear to be thicker than a typical T206.  If I were you, I'd pass on this lot.\n\nRegards,\nScott",

There's too much space at the bottoms of the cards.  This matches several reprints I've seen with the same back characteristics.\n\nIn my view, these four are definite fakes.\n\n\nSteve",
