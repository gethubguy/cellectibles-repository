      "post_content": "Scans are available upon request and trade offers are always welcome.  I always discount for multiple purchases as well.\n\nThe one notable addition to this list as of late is the f50 Earl Smith.  I'm still not really sure what sort of value to put on this, however the Smith from the Heritage auction was receiving genuine bids at $12 and $13K before the auction was pulled so I figure I'd start around there. I'm flexible though and open to input from others on this one.\n\n\nF50 Green Harrington's Earl Smith SGC 20 -- $11,000\n\nc46 Complete Set of 90 -- $3850 \nt201 Meyers/Doyle GD/VG - mild corner wrinkle -- $35\nt205 Leach PSA AUT [Broadleaf back] - torn corner, otherwise very nice - $75\nt205 Fromme VG - no wrinkling -- $30\nt205 Lord VG - no wrinkling -- $30\nt205 Simmons VG - no wrinkling -- $30\nt205 Richie VG - no wrinkling -- $30\nt205 Gaspar VG - one corner wrinkle -- $30\nt205 McGraw SGC 40 - one very faint corner wrinkle -- [SOLD!]\nt206 Attabacchio PR/FR - several wrinkles/creases -- [SOLD!]\nt206 Ford PR/FR - several wrinkles/creases -- [SOLD!]\nt206 Chance (port - YELLOW) PR/FR - pinhole, wrinkling - $40\nt207 Fromme VG+ - mostly sharp corners, no wrinkling -- $35 \nt207 Schaefer VG - offcentered, sharp corners, no wrinkling -- $30 \nt209-2 Ebinger (Wilmington) VG - mild corner wear, no wrinkling -- $110\nt209-2 Beusewein (Charlotte) GD - one corner wrinkle, mild staining -- $90\nt209-2 McKeavitt (Winston Salem) GD - one corner wrinkle, mild staining -- $90\nt209-2 Stouch (Greenville) FR/GD - mild surface wear, no significant wrinkling -- $80\nt209-2 Hearne (Wilson) PR/FR - wear on front -- $70\nt209-2 Fairbanks (Spartanburg) FR/GD - rough lower corner, no wrinkling -- [SOLD]\nt209-2 Drumm (Greenville) PR/FR - WOF, rough lower corner -- $85\nt209-2 Brent (Winston Salem) FR/GD - nicks on photo, no significant creasing -- $80\nt209-2 Morgan (Goldsboro) FR - mild wrinkling/surface wear -- $80\nt209-2 Boyle (Fayetteville) PR - wear/nicks on front -- $60\nt209-2 Kelley (Wilmington) FR/GD - mild wrinkling -- $80\nt209-2 Midkiff (Winston Salem) FR/GD - corner wear, edge chipping, no wrinkling -- $80\nt209-2 Jenkins (Greenville) PR/FR - chipping along border, nearly flawless photo -- [SOLD]\nt209-2 Jackson (Spartansburg) FR/GD - heavy crease towards upper right corner -- $80 \nt210 Series 7 Ham SGC 20 - The ONLY example that has been slabbed by PSA, SGC, etc.. -- $135\nt210 Series 7 Hyames  SGC 30 (no creases) -- $285\nt210 Series 7 Irving SGC AUT - The ONLY example that has been slabbed by PSA, SGC, etc.. -- $110\nt210 Series 7 Gunderson SGC 10 - The ONLY example to be graded by SGC -- $85\nt222 Lee Magee SGC 10 - second toughest card in set -- $1200 \ne92 Dockman Shean PSA 4 mk - no creasing, very little wear, mostly sharp corners, bit of writing on back -$110\ne92 Dockman Donovan PSA 3 mk - no wrinkling/creasing, tiny pencilmark on back --$75\ne92 Dockman McLean PSA AUT - trimmed with back damage but very nice on front -- $25\ne92 Dockman Miller PSA AUT - wrinkling on front w/ back damage -- $25\ne92 Dockman Murphy PSA AUT - recolored corner on front, backdamage -- $20\ne92 Dockman Ohara PSA AUT - nice on front, NO trimming, heavy back damage -- $25\ne92 Dockman Smith PSA AUT - great color and little wear on front, no trimming, heavy back damage -$25\ne93 BLANK BACK Collins SGC AUT - very sharp....no wear...hand cut with a blank back - $340\ne97 Camnitz B&W/PROOF SGC 20 - very little wear, one corner scratch, no creasing --- $365 \ne99 Maggert PSA AUT - lowest POP report in set, tiny pinhole, very little wear -- $600 \ne100 Cutshaw PSA 1 - rounded corners, nice HORIZONTAL POSE, very tough -- $875 \ne101 Bender (blue back variation) FR - tiny wrinkles and \"flecks\" on surface ...tough variation!! -- $225 \ne102 Wagner (fielding) SGC 10 - creases/corner wear.
