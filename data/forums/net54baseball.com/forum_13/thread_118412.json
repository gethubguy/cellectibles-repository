      "post_content": "Hi all,\nI am down to the final card on the front back combo to fill the HOF backs line.  After comparing my stuff with the confirmed list, I have two options to fill this slot.  Anyone willing to part with a SC 350-460 Factory 42 (No overstrike) 3 Finger Brown or Willis Throwing in VG or VGEX graded condition??!!\nI will pay well above market for one of these two cards, via Paypal.  I need to get the pot out to auction really quick to make up for some loss of income coming shortly.\nThanks for the help,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
