At this point, any grade would do, just to fill the hole.\n\nIf you've got one you'd consider parting with, I will make it worth your while, $$, trade, or both.\n\nHave some trade material - mostly pre-war Pirates stuff and other T207 an a smattering of other older material.  Pretty much everything from the trade/sale page (link below) as well as albums other than the T207 set at my [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/gspinf\"]ImageEvent site[/URL] would be fair game for this.\n\n[URL=\"mikefrohme@yahoo.com\"]Send me an email[/URL] if you have any interest, and thanks for looking.  \n--\nMike",
