      "post_content": "Hey guys, I am looking to fill a hole in my backs collection.  I am looking for a common or semistar in SGC 40 or 50 first, but would consider a PSA 3 or 4.  Cubs guys would also be a plus, but I am mainly just looking for the back since I do not own one yet.  Frame or no frame, I need both.  Needs to be a clean back with no damage.  I would like to get a deal done tonight if at all possible.\n\nThanks!",
