It doesn't really fit my collection, so if someone would like it, just post here and I'll e-mail you for your address and mail it to you free of charge. All I ask is that it's for your collection and not for resale. The card is ungraded with multiple creases.\n\nNo e-mails, please. First post here gets it, and I'll be in touch.\n\nThanks, Rob",
