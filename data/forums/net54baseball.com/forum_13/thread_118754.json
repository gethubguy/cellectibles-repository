      "post_content": "Hello,  I have for sale this PSA2 T206 Cy Young portrait card with the more rare Old Mill type of back.  It has NO creases, NO missing paper on either side, and only a very slight hair line surface paper wrinkle on the back.  The front's color and image of Cy Young is really nice.  I know that the only reason why PSA didn't grade it higher, is due to the slight tobacco stain spot on the Old Mill back.  SGC might not be so harsh on downgrading for tobacco stains like PSA is and could grade this card higher.  My firm asking price for this Cy Young T206 is $420 with insured shipping included.  If interested; please email me at [url]trreeves@cox.net[/url] or feel free to call me at 949-857-6247. Thank you & Happy Holidays.  Tom Reeves; Irvine, Ca",
