I would also consider working in a VG or VGEX graded SC 150/25 and a SC 350-460/42 (no overprint) that I don't have.\n($$$ have priority over trades if a purchase comes in while trying to iron out a trade)\n\nPSA 5 Eddie Collins Old Mill back: $395\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206CollinsOMPSA5.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206CollinsOMPSA5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
