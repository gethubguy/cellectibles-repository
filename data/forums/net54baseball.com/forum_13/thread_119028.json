      "post_content": "For sale or trade, this is a 60 card lot of T206's.  There are three HOF's (Bender, Clarke and Marquard), a Chase pink portrait and a couple of tougher backs.  All cards are obviously in poor condition and have major issues such as paper loss, damage, missing pieces, trimming, etc.  Still, this is more than 10% of the set and would make a great starter/filler lot for somebody looking to check a bunch of cards off the list without spending a ton of money.  \n\nI am asking $400 delivered for the lot or I would be glad to trade for T207's, e90-1's, or other lower grade pre-war cards.  I'm not looking to break up the lot at this point.  Thanks for looking and please e-mail with any offers.\n\nLOT IS SOLD.  THANKS FOR LOOKING.",
