      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI would like to buy, or maybe trade for a T213-3 Miller Huggins port card.  Low grade is just fine as it will blend in nicely with my low end Type 1 and Type 2 Huggins ports, but will take a look at any that anyone would like to get rid of and help my finish off my 3 types of the T213 run of Huggins cards.  If you have any of the other pose, I will be more than happy to take a look at those as well.\nHappy Holidays,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
