      "post_content": "I'm currently looking for a low grade T205 Muggsy in an SGC slab that has a nice looking front.  The back can be damaged, I just want the front to have nice color and not too much damage.  This will be part of a framed display which is why the front is really my main concern.\n\nI'm hoping for something in the $40 - $50 range for this one.\n\nAnyone have anything that might help me out?  Please email me with scans and prices if you have anything.\n\n[url]andyhuntoon@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks a lot guys,\n\nAndyH",
