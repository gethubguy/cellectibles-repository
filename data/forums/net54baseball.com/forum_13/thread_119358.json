Thanks!\n\nedit: I guess I should clarify - I am somewhat picky about condition. The vast majority of my Superba collection is P-F and all are unslabbed. I'm looking for like condition cards. Thanks very much to those who have already PMed me. I appreciate the time taken to reach out to a new guy. I'm active over on CU and have been a member of OBC since '96 but have only lurked here from time to time.",

I was going to pick one of those up for my collection, but I got one in an ebay auction for $28 just the other day.  \n\nGood luck on your subset!",
