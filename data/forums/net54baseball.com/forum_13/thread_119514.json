I will show you a picture of the condition of the cards and if your interested please let me know. Backs are Piedmont, Polar Bear, Sweet Caporal, Sovereign. 4 cards have slight paper loss on back, 5 look to be slightly trimmed, and the 1 chesbro in good to vg condition. As you can see the cards are really nice. I am asking $2000 OBO for the entire lot. Thanks for looking! [url]mpowers23@verizon.net[/url]",
