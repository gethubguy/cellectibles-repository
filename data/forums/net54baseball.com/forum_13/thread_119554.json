      "post_content": "Lot of 27 T206's for sale.  Most are Sweet Caporal backs.  I would really prefer to sell them as one lot, but if there is one card you must have, I would possibly listen.  I am not going to set a price, just make me decent offers.  Shipping will be free, so you do not need to worry about working in the shipping price with your offer.  I have scans of each individual card, but the link may or may not work.  Below are scans which you should be able to see.  If the link doesn't work email me if you want individual scans. \n\nChris\n[url]ckb333@gmail.com[/url]\n\n[url]http://picasaweb.google.com/ckb333/200912Dec?feat=directlink[/url]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page3Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page3Back0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page2Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page2Back0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page1Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page1Back0001.jpg[/IMG]",
