      "post_content": "I was very fortunate to be able to trade for a larger 09 Obak group recently.

      "post_content": "Guys, my fault on this.  I posted the 1909 Obaks that I still NEED yesterday.  I corrected that mistake just now and up above are the actual cards I have with their conditions/grades listed out.  I apologize for that...\n\nSince I've now posted the correct list with the actual grades, I thought that I'd add that if anyone wanted to upgrade an existing card they have with one of mine, that is fine too and we can work something out.  \n\nI wondered why I was getting notes about Gandil....even when I was at work today and didn't have the list in front of me, I was thinking to myself \"well gee, I know I don't have THAT card...\"  :)",
