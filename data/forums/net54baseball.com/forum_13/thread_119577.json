Paypal or other forms of payment work for me.\n\nUPDATE: only the T206 Evers is still available, the other 3 cards have been sold.  Thanks!\n\nT206 Evers (Chicago with bat) PSA 2............................$85\nNice card with a spot of paper loss on the upper right corner as well as on the back.  At first glance it does not appear to have a crease, but does display a very faint horizontal hairline above his right elbow (right on the sleeve).  It actually is more visible on the pic then it is in person.\n\n[IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_016_1263347803.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/mobiquo/ http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_017_1263347802.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** T206 Tinker (bat on shoulder) Sovereign 460 SGC 30........***SOLD*** $95 ***SOLD***\nCorner creases on the two lower corners and a slight hairline corner crease in the upper left corner.\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/mobiquo/ http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_011_1263347809.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_013_1263347808.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** T206 Chance (yellow) SGC 30......................................***SOLD*** $85 ***SOLD***\nCorner crease in the upper left corner and a slight hairline crease running horizontally from left-to-right on the bottom border\n\n[IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_014_1263347806.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_015_1263347805.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD**** T205 George Stone PSA 3...........................................***SOLD*** $30  ***SOLD***\nNice card with a slight hairline crease in the upper left corner.\n[IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_006_1263347812.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_007_1263347811.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLovely Day...",
