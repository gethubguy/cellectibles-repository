At first glance it does not appear to have a crease, but does display a very faint horizontal hairline above his right elbow (right on the sleeve).  It actually is more visible on the pic then it is in person.\n\n[IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_016_1263347803.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/mobiquo/ http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_017_1263347802.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nE96 Myers.................................................................SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_450.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://app4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/picture_451.jpg[/IMG]",
