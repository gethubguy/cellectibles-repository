I have a few of each from my initial \"press run\" that I can make available for $3 apiece postpaid.\n\nEach card is in the original 1-7/16\" x 2-5/8\" format in full-color, front and back, on stock replicating the originals. You can drop cash, check or M.O. in an envelope to Bob Lemke, P.O. Box 8, Iola, WI, or PayPal to [url]crystalsdad1979@yahoo.com[/url].\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=12460&d=1263508945[/IMG]",
