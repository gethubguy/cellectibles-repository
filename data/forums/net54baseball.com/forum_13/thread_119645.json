      "post_content": "Hello All, \nAfter a year or so break I am back to working on my T206 set. I have about 200 cards. I am looking for cards in the Poor-Good-VG at best range. I primarily need commons and southern leaguer's. If you have 1 card or hundreds please let me know as I am anxious to finish the set. Also if you have a large group with many cards I already have, I will still be interested as I would like to upgrade many of my Poor cards to Fair. Please let me know if you have any T206 available for sale. Please email me at [url]bucklercards@yahoo.com[/url].  \n\nThanks,\nChris",
