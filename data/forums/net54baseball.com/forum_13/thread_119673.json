      "post_content": "Hi all. I have decided to go with SGC graded cards only, so I have this beautiful PSA 5 Billy Sullivan I would like to trade for a SGC 60 of the same. I just don't want to take the time and added expense of having it crossed over. I would also trade for a SGC 50 if I can get one with an Old Mill back. The other scan shows 2 cards I can offer in trade to sweeten the deal for the OM version. Let me know what you have.",
