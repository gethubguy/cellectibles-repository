      "post_content": "I noticed you moved this Rube Marquard PSA 4 to ebay the other day. I was the high bidder up until today then poof! It vanished from my list of cards I was bidding on. You ended the auction early. If a card is listed on ebay, it should be listed for the full duration of the auction. I would have made an offer to you for this card but when I saw it move to ebay, I decided I would win it there. I planned on winning that card. I think I will start a thread asking if it is ethical to end an auction early using you as an example. What do you think?\n\nUpdate: Thanks for talking to me, you're a stand-up guy.",
