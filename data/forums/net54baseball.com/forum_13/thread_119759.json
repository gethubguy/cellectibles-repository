      "post_content": "Hello All,\nI am back to working on my T206 set. I have about 200 cards. I am looking for cards in the Poor-Good-VG at best range. I primarily need commons and southern leaguer's. If you have 1 card or hundreds please let me know as I am anxious to finish the set. Please let me know if you have any T206 available for sale or trade. \n\nPlease email me at [url]bucklercards@yahoo.com[/url].\n\nThanks,\nChris :)",
