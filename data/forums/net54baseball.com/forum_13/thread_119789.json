I would prefer SGC graded 4's and higher but will take any condition raw or graded.  Also if you have any I need for my registry in SGC (or can cross to SGC) 4's and higher.  Here is a link to my registry list:\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=794&userset=2843[/url]\n\nPlease send scans and prices to me @ [url]pup6913@hotmail.com[/url].",
