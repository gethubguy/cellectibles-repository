If anyone has any C46s from those that I need (see below) and is interested in in trading for any of the cards below, shoot me an email (richard@richardarmstrong.ca).  Alternatively, if I can't trade, I'd sell these instead.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.\n\nC46s I need:\n------------\n3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 31, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 56, 59\n61, 62, 63, 64, 69, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 88, 89, 90\n\nSee the links below for massive scans:\n\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/ForTrade_Fronts.gif[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/ForTrade_Backs.gif[/IMG]",
