      "post_content": "$50 delivered. Dobson has two very small pinholes that are noticeable if you hold the card up against the light. They're very small and I didn't even notice them until today unfortunately. I would trade for T204, T213-1s I need. Thanks, Andy\n\n[IMG]http://i671.photobucket.com/albums/vv73/Cloran86/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/jan24c.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i671.photobucket.com/albums/vv73/Cloran86/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/jan24d.jpg[/IMG]",
