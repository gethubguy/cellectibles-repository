      "post_content": "I want to make some progress on my T206 set, right now I am sitting at about 32%. I want to trade the following cards for T206's that I need. Almost all cards were graded at one point, however, I have cracked most because I usually buy slabbed and collect raw. I kept most of the flips and can try to find them if you want to have them. If any of these cards interest you please email me what you have available and I will send scans and hopefully we can work something out. I am looking to trade these cards for T206's in about the same condition (good to very good). Here they are:\n\nT206:\n\nBay, Nashville (Southern Leaguer) G-VG\nHelm, Columbus (Southern Leaguer) G\nMolesworth, Birmingham (Southern Leaguer) G\nRhoades, St. Louis (EPDG) G-VG\nMcCormick, New York (Piedmont) G-VG\nMyers, New York (Sweet Caporal) G-VG\nPhillippe, Pittsburg (Piedmont) G-VG\nTitus, Philly (Piedmont) G-VG\nPickering, Minneapolis (Piedmont) G-VG\nBrain, Buffalo (Sweet Caporal) G\n\n\nN162:\n\nAndrews, G-VG (this is the only one that would not grade numerical because it has been touched up just a little on the front, must see scan to appreciate card)\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nJeff\n[url]jwilliams81@mac.com[/url]",
