      "post_content": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy t206 quest is TEMPORARILY taking a giant step backwards due to my daughter's wanting to study in Italy next semester.  I plan on putting my t206 cards up on eBay over the next few weeks but I thought that I would offer them here first.  There are many Hall of Famers and rare cards available.  I'm mainly just looking to get out of them what I paid.  All cards can be viewed at:\n \n[url]http://www.psacard.com/SetRegistry/publishedset.aspx?s=52683&ac=1[/url]\n\nIndividual scans available on request.  Shipping is on me.  Checks, money orders, & paypal are all acceptable.  My eBay feedback can be checked under user name \"rknfurnish\"  I can also be emailed at [url]rknfurnish@aol.com[/url]\n\n\nHere's what is available:\n                                                        \nBarry, Milwaukee                        psa 4              $48        Polar Bear SOLD\nChief Bender, with trees        psa 3.5           $120      Piedmont 350\nChief Bender, portraitpsa 5  $425      Pied 150 PENDING \nJoe Birmingham      psa 4.5  $120      Pied 350\nLena Blackburnepsa 5  $85        Pied 350 SOLD\nMordecai Brown, Chicago shirt psa 5  $330      Sweet Cap 350 PENDING\nBobby Byrnepsa 4.5  $65        Pied 350 PENDING\nBilly Campbellpsa 4  $56        Pied 350\nDoc Caseypsa 5   $85       Pied 350 PENDING\nPeter Cassidypsa 4   $45       Pied 350 SOLD\nFrank Chance, battingpsa 5   $395     Old Mill PENDING\nFrank Chance, yellow portrait         psa 5       $425  highest ranked Polar Bear PENDING\nHal Chase, dark cappsa 4   $100     Pied 350-460\nJ.J.
