The card was sold, but the buyer had to back out of the deal due to familyhealth issues.  \n\nI'm looking for 33 goudey PSA 5 #53 Ruth, #92 Gehrig, #181 Ruth, and #223 Dean. I would also be willing to entertain other trades.\n\nI'm sure there would be cash involved to get a trade done.\n\nIf you'd like to buy the cards,  you can also e-mail me at [url]incugator@Hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a376/incugator/T3Brown.jpg[/IMG]\n\n-Ryan",
