      "post_content": "Hi. Not crazy about getting rid of these but will do so for the right price/trade.\nThey are both SGC 40's. Cash for the Merkle is $100, no offers less than that please. I will accept cash offers on the Phelan over $50 as I don't know what it's going for these days. I will also consider trades for SGC (only) graded T206's. 50's or 60's on commons, 40's or better on HOF'ers. Let me know what you have. Send scans & prices to [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nThanks!\nBoth Sold. Thanks!",
