Any condition and they can be graded or raw.\n\nLooking for examples with any of the three backs: Kotton, MINO, and Virginia Extra.\n\nIf you have something available send me an email: [url]crazylocomerk@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nWill buy or trade (I've got a few type cards available to use as trade bait).\n\nThanks for looking.",
