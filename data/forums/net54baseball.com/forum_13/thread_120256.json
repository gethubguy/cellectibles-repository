      "post_content": "In this time of tight budgets, I have taken to trading duplicates for other cards in order to continue the rush I get with new cards.  I have decided to trade off my oldest T206 card, a PSA 5 Nap Lojoie throwing.  I picked up this card at auction years ago, and although this is clearly the better card of my Lajoie throwing dupes, the remainder of my T206 HOF set is mainly PSA/SGC 2-3's.  Therefore I am looking to trade this beauty for a few lower grade T206 HOF's that I am missing.\n\nMainly looking for another T206 Lajoie (either with bat or port) in a PSA/SGC 3+ range, PLUS another big HOF like:\n1.  T206 Matty White Cap in the PSA/SGC 2-3 range\n2.  T206 Young with glove in the PSA/SGC 2-3 range\n3.  T206 Johnson (either pose) in the PSA/SGC 2-3 range\n4.  T206 Cobb low grade\n\nNot looking for rare backs, unless it is a Chance Yellow portrait.  \n\nPlease send offers (and scans) to my email address at [url]DHarford@satx.rr.com[/url].  \n\nFront on this post, back on next.\nThanks, Dave",
