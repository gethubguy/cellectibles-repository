      "post_content": "Hi again. I MAY be willing to trade these 2 type cards from my collection for the right card. These are SUPER nice SGC 50's (I've rarely seen better and usually much worse). What I want in return are SGC graded T206's. I will consider SGC 40's or better (NO creases) of any HOF'er's (esp. portraits) or Southern Leaguers : Otey, Jordan, Lafitte, Ellam, Bernhard, Mullaney, Thornton & Lipe, any Tolstoi, American Beauty or EPDG back. Also SGC 50's or better of: Powers or Merkle (throwing) would work. I know some of these are alot to ask but I might be able to throw some cash in for the right card. Let me know what you have and send scans to [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nThanks, Tony:)\nAll sold. Thanks!",
