Rather than list 100 cards I want, just tell me what you have available. I am interested especially in any HOF'ers 40 or better (no creases) or commons (50 or better). The 2 commons on top of my list are Mike Powers and Fred Merkle (fielding) followed by around 80 other cards. No list is too big or too small, let's make a deal! See attached scans and send yours to: [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url] with your offers.\nThanks!\nCards now for sale, see info below.",
