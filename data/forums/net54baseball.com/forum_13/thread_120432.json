Me making offers on Larry's cards, and the business I conduct with him or anyone else, has nothing whatsoever to do with this thread, my thread, that I started.  I also happen to buy cards from different years and sets.  Does that invalidate my request in this thread?\n\nIn this thread I asked for PSA 6s under $200.  You responded to that request by offering me a PSA 5 for $400.  That makes no sense whatsoever.",

So that is when i emailed you for your email address to send you a picture of and that is when  all of this got started. So don`t tell me that I am insane and confussed! That seems to be where you are right now! Try to remember what you said and if you can`t go back to the replies and see what you wrote!  It is all there. Have a great weekend!   :confused:",

When I asked why you were offering me this card, you said it was in response to my request thread, which as everyone can see who reads this thread, makes no sense whatsoever.  That is where this got off of the track.  Don't confuse me being polite in considering a PM with thinking your offer in this thread is o.k., because it is not.  I'm not interested in any unsolicited offers.  And since your offer is not a PSA 6 and is not under $200, I'm considering it unsolicited as long as it is in this thread.\n\nJudging from your spelling and grammar, I'll just consider that maybe you never read or understood the request qualifications and just consider this matter closed.",

If anyone has any questions about what is common courtesy pertaining to these area they can always email me and I will help them. Thanks....\n \nps....the BST area is a priviledge and not a right so please play nicely.....this isn't aimed squarely at anyone it's only a general statement",
