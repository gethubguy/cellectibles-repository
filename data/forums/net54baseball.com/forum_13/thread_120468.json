We have had some incredible weather here with corresponding power outages but I did send you a couple of emails yesterday. You might want to check your spam folder. Anyway, let me know if the Kling is still available and whether you are receiving my emails.\n\nThanks and sincerely, Martin",

I apologize to anyone who might have requested scans from me and was ignored.
