Some interesting, some not so much. Will consider offers for singles, groups or the whole group. Cash/Trade offers are fine. All must make sense to each of us. My collecting interests are T204\u2019s, PCL cards, S74 silks with backs, T3\u2019s and others.\nPrices include SH&I. PayPal OK with no additional vig. Email me for high resolution F&B scans and I will respond promptly. \nThanks for looking, and in no particular order:\n\nT206                      Hooks WILSTE PitchingPSA 4 60.00 \nT206                      Fred CLARKE Holding BatVG 75.00 \nT205                      James PHELAN POLAR BEARSGC 40 105.00 \nPB4 MOTHERS BREAD PIN GILHOOLEY                          PSA 5 50.00 \nW514                      Lefty WILLIAMS             SGC 40 300.00 \nBF2 PENNANT         Geo J.
