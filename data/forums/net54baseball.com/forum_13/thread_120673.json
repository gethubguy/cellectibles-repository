Here are the requirements for the card:\n\n- must be older than 1915\n- must be in the VG to VG-Ex range\n- can be graded or raw\n- cannot have any paper loss, writing or major creases\n- must have color (I do not want black and white cards)\n- would prefer an action pose rather than a portrait pose\n- must be under $100 delivered\n\nPlease post scans or send them via email to [url]brad_green@cox.net[/url].\n\nI will post here when I have found a card that meets these requirements.  At that point, my search will end.  Thanks for looking!",
