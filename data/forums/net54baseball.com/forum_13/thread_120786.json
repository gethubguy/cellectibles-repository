      "post_content": "I am looking to trade one (or more) of my Piedmont 42 T206s for one (or more) of your rare-backed T206s in PSA 5.  Ideallly, I would swap one of my Piedmont 42s straight-up for a Carolina Brights PSA 5.  However, I will also consider cash/trade deals for a Hindu, Broad Leaf or Lenox PSA 5.  SGC 60s also considered.\n\nI am offering three Piedmont 42s as possible trade bait:\n\nChase (Trophy) PSA 4 (rare 460-only subject with Piedmont 42; high-end for the grade)\n\nManning (Pitching) PSA 5 (slightly off-center, but otherwise very nice)\n\nSteinfeldt (With Bat) PSA 5 (lower end for the grade due to tiny wrinkle on front and light staining on back, but I have never seen another copy of this front/back combo in 7 years of looking)\n\nScans below (I could only attach 5 scans--email for back scan of Steinfeldt).\n\nScot",
