You might be a little more patient. The hobby might not be real fun if you aren't. I have a T206 Johnson Lenox but I think he is a bit out of what it sounds like your range is. All of my others are in my personal collection.;....good luck in the hunt (Which is half the fun anyway)",

This way you can see the progress. \n\nI have been collecting the t206 Baltimore team for years-at the biginning I could add a front/back combo about once every other week or so. In one six month period I added 3 Broad Leafs-I have not added another BL in 3 years and have only found 2 new additions to my collection in the past year and 3 in the  past 2 years.\n\nIt is really neat to go back and look where my collection stood in 2000 or 2002. I didn't keep any records to speak of before 2000.",
