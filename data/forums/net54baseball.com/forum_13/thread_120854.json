I was going to list it on ebay and then use the proceeds for a card purchase but figured I'd thow it out there and see if the fish were biting. CD's are like new and included all inserts and booklet. Again, I hope this isn't too weird of an offer. If so, feel free to delete this posting.",

Well, \"I'll be the best I can\" in regards to crafting a response. \n\nFirst time visitors to Net54 who view your thread might think, \"People are strange\" for posting such a request. But then they will think about the request and \"Tell All the People\" about this great idea. \n\nPersonally, I was glad to see the request. The love of my life, \"Maggie M'Gill\" left me last night..for a woman from LA. I was pretty upset so \"I was going to the roadhouse to have a real good time\" but they didn't open for a few more hours. But, with time to kill before the bar opened, I thought of a woman in my office, I think her name is \"Della Brown,\" who is quite cute so I might pursue her.\n\nDo you think it would be too forward if I walked up to her and said, \"Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name?\"\n\nConcerning the trade of the boxvset, I'll take \"5 to 1\" odds that you don't find any takers.",
