      "post_content": "Offered for sale is among the highest graded HOFer's from the T213-1 set.  Card is appropriately graded showing honest corner wear.  Back and front are clean.  I believe the Coupon type 1's to be a T206 issue, making this rare back desirable.  Additionally, T213-1's were printed on thin cardboard stock making this issue tough to find in presentable condition.\n\nPrice is $1300 insured delivery.  Email me at [url]darren.duet@chouest.com[/url] with interest.  Scans will be available this evening with requests.\n\nRegards",
