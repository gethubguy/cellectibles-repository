      "post_content": "Hello again. Not as weird a trade offer (????) as the last one (Doors box set) BUT, would anyone like to trade me a SGC graded T206 (HOF'er or tougher back SGC 40 no creases OR a SGC 50-60 common I need) for a copy of the Old Judge Book: The Photographic Baseball Cards of Goodwin & Company? It's brand new, I only flipped thru it once. It's a beautiful and informative book (and just fun to look at) but I am not going to pursue the OJ's like I thought, I'll just stick to the T-206's. I'll take the best offer over the next couple of days. This book was like $125 when it 1st came out and worth every penny. Send any scans of cards to [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nSold, thanks Jeff!",
