I've been out of collecting for a while... started a family. \n\nAnyway, I'm looking to sell some Southern Leaguers to raise some cash for a gun purchase. I'm looking to get around $1400.00 for the group of 10. I'm willing to hear offers on singles as well.\n\n[IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/3552/67532437.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7945/82815257.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/4747/36255302.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7641/78011252.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/4354/58875193.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/7616/68874940.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nZach",

It seems the seller has zero ethics. He agreed with me to a price, and then 2 minutes later nixed our deal in favor of a few more dollars. Im actually glad now that I wont be doing business with this seller, as he doesnt understand HOW to do business properly.",

The seller claims that he had prior PMs to mine, yet he responded to mine with a total price shipped to my door? What really happened is that he got a higher offer right after mine and went for the extra cash. I once sold a coin for $35 on a BST and within 25 minutes I was offered $900 for the coin. It turned out to be a rare variety. What did I do? I sold it for $35 to the guy who offered my asking price first. Its called integrity, and while the extra $865 would have been long gone by now, I can still hold my head up high as my reputation in the hobby is unblemished. I've said my piece. Congrats to the guy who \"outbid\" me in this NON-auction format.:)",
