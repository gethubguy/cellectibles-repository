Email me or respond here if interested.  Thanks.\n\nT222 Archer (SGC 30) - nice for a GD card, with the usual cracks and a small tear on the left border $125\nT222 Benton (SGC Auth) - difficult high #.  Short left-to-right, but otherwise VG sold\nT222 Bush (SGC 40) - solid VG card sold\nT222 Panzer (SGC 40) - the actor & actresses 'Photoplay' cards are even tougher that the baseball short-prints and this is a very nice VG example.  $150\n\n<center>\n[IMG]http://www.t207.com/images/sale/t222/t222_archer_sgc30_both.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.t207.com/images/sale/t222/t222_benton_sgcA_both.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.t207.com/images/sale/t222/t222_bush(1)_sgc40_both.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.t207.com/images/sale/t222/t222_panzer(1)_sgc40_both.jpg[/IMG]\n</center>",
