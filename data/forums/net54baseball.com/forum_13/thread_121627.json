If it doesn't, feel free to return it for a full refund.\n\n$195. Payment can be made by check or money order (If I recognize you from the board, I'll ship the day after we reach a deal to make up for the no-PayPal delay.). Shipping will be $3.\n\nE-mails to reserve the card take precedent over posts and PMs. Feel free to pass along any questions.\n\nThanks, Rob\n\nwolfie51sb at aol.com",
