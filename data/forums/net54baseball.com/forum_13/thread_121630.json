      "post_content": "Evening Folks,\n\n   I have a bit of money in my PayPal account and am wondering if I might be able to turn it into a few more C46s for my set.  I'm at 57/90 so far, and would love to break the 60 mark before summer hits and baseball cards take a back seat to sunshine and actual baseball games.\n\nThat said, I'm looking for vg-ish cards raw or graded.  I have a few duplicate C46s and a couple others T-s I can trade too if folks are interested.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nRichard.\n\n\n3Frenchy LeClaire\n5James Murray\n6Joe Ward\n10Royal Rock\n12Butch Schmidt\n15Jack Kelley\n18Doc Adkins\n19Jack Dunn\n25Charlie French\n31Bayard Sharpe\n37Rube Vickers\n39Shadow Carroll\n40Jake Gettman\n41Luther Taylor\n43Robert Fisher\n44Fred Parent\n45James Dygert\n48Heinie Batch\n49Michael Corcoran\n51George Wheeler\n54Fred Beebe\n56Robert Wells\n59Vernon Manser\n61Rube Dessau\n62Fred Jacklitsch\n63Stanley Graham\n69Bob Gaunt\n72Rube Kissinger\n73William Malarkey\n74William Byers\n77Joseph McGinnity\n78Jack Hardy\n88Dick Breen",
