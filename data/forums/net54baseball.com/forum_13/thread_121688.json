      "post_content": "I am looking to purchase a bunch of T206 cards in PSA 6 grade.  A bulk or lot of these would be great. 1 card or 50 cards.  Minor Leaguers or commons preferred.  I only have about 25% of the set so the chances are good that I need what you have.\n\n\nPlease PM if you have some to sell. \n\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid :)",
