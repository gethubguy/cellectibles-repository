      "post_content": "Hello all. These are the last 2 SGC graded T206's I have to move along. I have tried the trade route without much luck (see my previous post -\"SGC 60's\" for the full list of my wants). So I will try the sale route and fund my own purchases. The Schaefer is $100 ppd and the Jackson is $65 ppd. If someone wants them both, you can have them for $150 ppd (ins. $4 extra). Paypal (gift if poss.)/mo/check all good.\nThanks!\nBoth sold via ebay.",
