      "post_content": "Hello all,\nAnyone need a HOFer with a difficult back?  T206 Drum backed Vic Willis graded SGC A.  It looks just like a bunch of the other Drums out there.\nCARD HAS BEEN TRADED.\n\nI have pulled this one back out of the box and is on the market. I would trade for a bunch of VG HOFers that do not have Piedmont and Sweet Cap backs. Old Mill or Sovereign White Cap Matty in VG-VGEX would be a nice piece of trade bait.\n\nI would consider all HOFers with mid difficulty backs in VG range.\n\nLets do some trading!!!!\n\n\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206DrumWillisFront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206DrumWillisFront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206DrumWillisBack.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206DrumWillisBack.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
