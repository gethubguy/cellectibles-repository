As of now I am not looking to sell individual cards, but feel free to PM me if there is something you really need. \n\n[url]ckb333@gmail.com[/url]  \n\nSOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page3Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page3Back0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page2Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page2Back0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page1Front0001.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/cbcbcb_photos/T206/T206Page1Back0001.jpg[/IMG]",
