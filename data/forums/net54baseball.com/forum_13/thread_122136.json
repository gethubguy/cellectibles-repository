      "post_content": "Slowly making progress on this very challenging set.  I am looking to buy or trade for the following T207s.  I will take them in any condition, even total beaters.  I'm mainly looking for lower grade for now.  I have included scans of some of my tradebait.  I also have more than 300 other T205, T206, T207, etc including many other HOF's, SL's and short prints available to trade for T207s that I need.  I'm not looking to sell right now, only trade.  Please feel free to e-mail or PM me with any offers, large or small.
