This card was offered on ebay and the winning bidder never paid (after 5 emails to him and several promises from him) and will be offered here for 3 days at the \"sold for\" ebay price before I offer it to the second high ebay bidder at his bid. NO PMs, emails will be addressed in the order received [url]Snoopy525@Embarqmail.com[/url] There are 5 recorded PSA 4 sales on VCP with the latest and highest being $587.50, the lowest is $372.
