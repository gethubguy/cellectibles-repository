After negotiating a deal with Jamie for $1300 for the card, he told me the only caveat was that it \"might take a couple weeks\" before he gets the card. In our several emails, I was very clear to him that I dont mind waiting, as long as I was guaranteed the card....he said no problems. He never once said he didnt own the card, or that it was in a live auction. He led me to believe he was just waiting on delivery. Basically Jamie was going to use my money as leverage to win that auction without disclosing it to me. VERY deceptive indeed!!! Jamie should be ashamed of these actions. If he needs an \"auction partner\", he should just ask for that rather than trying to sell a card he may never even own! \n\n\nI want to thank the couple of members who \"busted\" him on this scam. Saved me some potential grief. I know Leon is very tolerant on activities on this BST, but in my opinion, this type of activity is unethical at best, criminal at worst!\n\nPhil",
