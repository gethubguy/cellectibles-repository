      "post_content": "I would like to expand my SGC 40 or 50 T206 HOF'er collection. I have these that I can offer for yours. Also will trade for SGC 50-60 T206 White Sox I need. My only caveat for the HOF'ers is they can't have any creases. Corner creases, rounded corners, worn backs, even a bit dirty all fine. They just can't have any creases or wrinkles in the body of the card. I don't care about what back they are, more common the better if it keeps the price down. Postage will be $3 and insurance (if you want it) $3+ depending on value purchased.\n\nSGC 50's:\nCy Barger  Piedmont 350  SOLD\nGinger Beaumont  Piedmont 350  SOLD\nJack Quinn  SC 350  SOLD\nJohn Titus  Sovereign 350  SOLD\nSGC 40's:\nHeine Wagner  Bat on Left Shoulder  SC 150 SOLD\nHarry Covaleski  Piedmont 150 SOLD\nFred Snodgrass  SC 350 (Orange Variation)  $55\n\nI need: Chesbro, Waddell (both), Jennings (all 3), Keeler (both), Willis (all 3), Wallace, Beckley, Clarke (both), Joss (pitching), McGinnity, Wheat, Marquard (all 3), McGraw (all 4), Baker, Flick & Huggins (portrait).\nThanks!",
