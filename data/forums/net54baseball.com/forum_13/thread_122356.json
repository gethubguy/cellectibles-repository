First to email me stating \"I will take it\" will get the card(s) they want.  I'd prefer PayPal, but will happily take a check or money order.\n\nI just got a new computer and my scanner is not working right now, so if there isn't a back scan then I won't be able to get one for you.  These cards are all low grade though, so not having a back scan on a poor condition strip card shouldn't be a big deal anyway.\n\nPlease be patient when waiting for a response, but know that I will respond to all inquiries.\n\n[url]http://picasaweb.google.com/andyhuntoon/BST?feat=directlink[/url]\n\nThank you very much,\n\nAndyH\n[url]andyhuntoon@gmail.com[/url]",
