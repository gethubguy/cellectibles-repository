      "post_content": "I've recently picked up a handful of cards here and on Ebay in the Authentic/ trimmed category that were very nice looking cards in the $20-$25 range.  I don't have the issue with trimming that most people do as long as there is a respectable looking boarder on the card.  I'm more interested in the overall presentation of the card - good colors, registration, absence of creases, etc.  Not interested in beaters/massive paper/tomahawked cards, but in really nice looking cards that someone took a razor to at some point, for whatever reason, and rendered them less valuable in the eyes of most collectors.\n\nEmail me at [url]jlynch@capspart.com[/url] if you have any cards in this price range/condition that you would care to part with.",
