      "post_content": "Hello everyone,\n\nUp for sale is a T200 Pittsburgh Pirates team card featuring HOFers Honus Wager, Fred Clarke, and Max Carey. This has been graded by a company that no longer exists. The bottom edge looks trimmed to me but otherwise there are no flaws. The back is 100 percent clean and there aren't any creases in the card. Corners are sharp and the border is unchipped. Card is guaranteed to grade authentic or money back. I'd like to get $200 shipped and insured for it. E-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url] or PM.\n\n[IMG]http://s107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/fatima.jpg[/IMG]",
