      "post_content": "I'm looking for this card in a lower grade but with a nice-looking front. I'd be willing to buy if I can afford it--or possibly work out a trade--but T206's are the only Pre-WWII cards I collect at the moment, and I have no doubles. I do have trade-ables from other eras, however.\n\nThanks",
