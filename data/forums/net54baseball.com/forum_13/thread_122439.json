      "post_content": "Need to raise funds for a purchase. These cards have been in my personal collection for a long time. Roy Castleton was the first Mormon to play in the big leagues while Spencer Adams was the first Mormon to play in the World Series. No matter what, these are neat cards.\n\n1910 T212 Obak and 1911 T212 Obak Castleton grade (GD) each with moderate creasing, nice colors, decent centering, and clean backs, with some soiling on the 1911. I'm asking $20 each on these.\n\n1924 Zeenuts Adams grades (FR) but also comes with a page taken from a 1925 World Series program. Heck, I'll even add a TCMA Spencer Adams cards. Most of his collectibles in one shot! (sorry Middy Bread)--Asking $20.\n\nPaypal is preferred, shipping included with delivery conf. Thanks so much!\n\nJames",
