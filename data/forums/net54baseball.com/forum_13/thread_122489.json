      "post_content": "Just completed the set, and while it was fun, its just not much fun without being able to discuss cards with others. Since it seems that more people want to fight than talk cards on both here AND over on CU, I have decided to part ways with both forums as well as with my collection. Below is a list. Some of these backs can be seen in my \"rare backs\" thread. I can produce scans of the others on request. Rather sell here than on ebay. Prices are shipped...break on 2 or more cards obviously.\n\nDrum Rube Kroh PSA 2---$2540.....Unavailable\nLenox Happy Smith PSA 2---$850....SOLD\nBL350 Purtell SGC 10 ---$310.........SOLD\nCB Dineen SGC 30---$395..............SOLD\nHindu brown Bergen PSA 2---$360...SOLD\nCycle 460 Sheckard PSA 4---$200...SOLD\nCycle 350 Arellanes SGC 40---$120...SOLD\nAB 460 Geyer SGC 50---$325...........SOLD\nAB 350 (Fm) O'Brien SGC 60---$290...SOLD\nAB 350 (no Fm) McQuillan PSA 3---$95....SOLD\n\n\nTotal on all is $5485....Will sell the whole lot at $5,000 DLVD if someone wants it. All payments must be either Paypal \"gift\", or USPS money order. Responses IN THIS THREAD will get priority. Thanks.\n\n\nScan of the Lenox per request:\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/Lenoxf.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/SmithLenoxb.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/drumpied42.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/drumpied42b.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/3absandacyclef.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/3absandacycleb.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/hindublf.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/hindublb.png[/IMG]",
