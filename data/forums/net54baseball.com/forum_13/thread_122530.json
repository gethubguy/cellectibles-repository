      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI have the following T206 Chase cards that I am considering for trades. The first is a T206 Chase Blue Port. with a Piedmont 460 Factory 42 back. It is graded PSA 4 but it is overgraded in my opinion. Looks more like a 3. The second is a T206 Chase with Trophy Sovereign 460 graded PSA 4. I am intested in trading for other hard to find T206 backs or possibly N28 base ball player between SGC 40 and 70. Also am considering trades for a Chase Colgans Chip PSA 8, which I believe is the highest graded by PSA or SGC. Thanks.\n\nDavid B\nOrions father\n[IMG]http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u200/Nedwob53/Orions%20father%20Album/T206ChasePiedmont460Factory42.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u200/Nedwob53/Orions%20father%20Album/T206ChasePiedmont460Factory42back.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u200/Nedwob53/Orions%20father%20Album/T206ChaseTrophySovereign460.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u200/Nedwob53/Orions%20father%20Album/T206ChaseTrophySovereign460back.jpg[/IMG]",
