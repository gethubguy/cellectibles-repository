      "post_content": "I've ended up with an extra T206 Jake Beckley (Piedmont 350) that I would like to sell or trade.  Scans available on request.  Asking price is $90.00 with delivery included.  Payment by check, money order, or PayPal gift is acceptable.  If you're interested in a trade, I'm building a set of T206 HOFers (any back) and SLers (Old Mill back only) graded PSA 3, and would also be interested in purchasing any cards fitting the bill irrespective of a trade.  Thanks.\n\nOFF to eBay...still looking for PSA 3s as described above.",
