      "post_content": "These 3 cards were recent eBay purchases with the intentions of crossing each over to an SGC 50 VG-EX.  However, they would not cross as they did not meet the minimum grade requested.  I thought I would try to sell them here first before putting them back on eBay.  \n\nJohnny Bates (eBay #290405747861) paid $84, will sell for $75 SOLD\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Vintage%20Cards/Bates.jpg[/IMG]\n\nChick Gandil (eBay #160405652845) paid $157, will sell for $145 SOLD\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Vintage%20Cards/Gandil.jpg[/IMG]\n\nCarlos Smith (eBay #270534571903) paid $187, will sell for $175 SOLD\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Vintage%20Cards/Smith.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAll prices include delivery.  Will give discount if purchasing more than 1 card, other than that the prices are FIRM.",
