      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI was able to upgrade my Old Mill spot with a nice VG Lajoie last week, so I have an extra Johnson SGC 30.  This one also has some really cool transfer that is worth some looking into (more than just the OM line on at left).\n\n\nI have an extra Tinker Sovereign 150 PSA 4.  It is a solid VGEX, seen better and worse, so not bad.  It is part of the group scan (Chance could be talked away too, also SOV 150 back!).  Great deep color!  I would like to keep one or the other for the backs spot.\n\nTinker $300\nChance $300\nJohnson $SOLD\n\nPaypal transfers best.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=PSA4Front.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/PSA4Front.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206OldMillJohnsonfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206OldMillJohnsonfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206OldMillJohnsonback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206OldMillJohnsonback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
