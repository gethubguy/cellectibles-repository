Card grades SGC 20 FR with some creasing and has a Sweet Caporal back. The card was treasured by Commissioner Kuhn in part because of his first baseball experiences as a scoreboard attendant for Clark Griffith's Washington Senators. Graded by SGC with special designation as having originated from the Kuhn collection. Includes letter of provenance from the Kuhn family.\"\n\n[url]http://www.huntauctions.com/LIVE/imageviewer_online.cfm?auction_num=33&lot_num=623&lot_qual=[/url]\n\nI actually don't recall getting the \"letter of provenance\" from the Kuhn family, but I'll keep trying to track it down.  The SGC slip may have to suffice....\n\nClean Sweet Cap 150 back.  (SGC got it wrong on the factory - it is not a Sovereign back)\n\nIf you're interested, please email me at [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks!",
