      "post_content": "I have a few lowergrade t215s available.  As you can see by the scans, each of these is somewhat rough with spots of paper loss on the front and some scuffing on the back.  On the whole, I'd say the Miller is the nicest card as the paper loss on the front is minimal and he doesn't really have any significant wear on the back at all. \n\nI listed each below with prices however would entertain trade offers for anything of value as well.  Thanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\nt215 Type 2 Lake-- $90\nt215 Type 1 Willits-- $125\nt215 Type 1 McIntyre -- $125\nt215 Type 1 Miller-- $165\n\n\nAll four have been sold.  Thanks guys!\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17422&d=1271734010[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17423&d=1271734034[/IMG]",
