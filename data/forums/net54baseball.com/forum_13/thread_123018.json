So I'd trade for an SGC 50, or I'll accept offers for a straight sale.  Thanks.\n\n[IMG]http://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv82/3fingerbrown/T206%20HOF%20For%20Sale/Mathewsonwhitecap565psa4.jpg?t=1271964698[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv82/3fingerbrown/T206%20HOF%20For%20Sale/Mathewsonwhitecapz565psa4.jpg?t=1271964723[/IMG]",
