      "post_content": "Don't have t206s available too often but I have a couple for this weekend.  Both with Sweet Corporal 350 backs.  Chase is a gorgous card - sharp corners, great color and no wrinkling.  Very attractive card in it's SGC 50 holder.  The Chance is rough, but it is a yellow portrait variation and even better - it's cheap!\n\nAsking $40 for the Chance and $145 for the Chase.  Thanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17683&d=1272058907[/IMG]",
