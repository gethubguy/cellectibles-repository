I have some cash if there is some difference to be made up.\nAlso looking for AB 350 Eddie Collins.\n\nI moved these cards to ebay to see how they do.  Seller ID is sampson21 please let me know if any questions.  Thanks!\n\nThanks as always,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206HOFlotfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206HOFlotfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206HOFlotback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206HOFlotback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
