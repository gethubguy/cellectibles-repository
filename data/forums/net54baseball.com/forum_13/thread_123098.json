      "post_content": "Hello, I wanted to give the board members one more shot at these two T210 Series 6 cards before I put them on ebay at the end of next week.  I have decided to focus on the Winchester and Richmond teams in the set and I am parting with these two cards.  They are \n\nKhulman Paris VG\nWomble Shelbyville VG\n\nI would take 200.00 for both and that includes shipping.  As always if someone has a low grade winchester or richmond player from series 6 I will trade both of these cards for that one card also.  We can negotioate on price also.  You can message me through the board or at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  I can accept paypal.  I have attached scans of the cards to this post.  both cards have no paper loss on the back.  If the scans dont come through just email me and I can send more.  Thanks\n\nWilliam",
