      "post_content": "I have a Chief Meyers (batting) T206 available for trade, which has several ghost images. One ghost image is of Chief Meyers, which can be seen in the right margin of the card with part of the image in the right white border. The second image I have never been able to identify. The 2nd ghost image extends into the left white border of the T206.\n\nI would glady trade this printing error T206 for items such as Chief Meyers colored S74s, and PCL catchers.\n\nSee below for scans of the front and back of the Chief Meyers T206. Scans were done at 600 DPI.\n\n\n\nPatrick",
