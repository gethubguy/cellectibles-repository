T222 Jimmy Archer PSA 3; $225 ppd.\n\nChase--slightly threadbare but top and bottom threads are excellent,no fraying except ever so slight upper left.\nTechnical grade probably VG-EX, although presents better and grading companies, to the extent they grade these at all, are notoriously tough:\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/imoverhere/prewar/various/huge/10s74chase.jpg[/IMG]\n(colored silk so no backing)\n\nBender-- has three horizontal/diagonal creases through area from pitching elbow to glove wrist. Technical grade probably g-vg, possibly VG.  Creases are not heavy but are in an obtrusive spot.  Well centered and corners Vg or better--presents very well for this issue.\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/imoverhere/prewar/various/huge/14t213bender_nt.jpg[/IMG]\n\nArcher-- has several crimps particular to this issue; three along left side about hat level and a couple full horizontal around knee/calf.  Well centered and the only PSA 3 with one graded higher (SGC pop report shows three in this grade).\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/imoverhere/prewar/various/huge/14t222archer.jpg[/IMG]",
