There's a hard to see wrinkle by his left cheek, doesn't go through to the back. Small \"ding\" (looks like a chip in scan, but isn't) in the border nearest his left shoulder as well.\n\nTaking offers.\n\nEmail: [url]trae@t206.org[/url] (PM fine also)\n\nI'd trade too, although I'm only into 50/50 centered and well registered T206 portraits, a.k.a. \"blazers\".\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/randallmilwaukef.jpg[/IMG]",
