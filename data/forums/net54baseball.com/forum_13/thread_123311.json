      "post_content": "Drum is a Kroh, PSA 2....light blue stain on the upper right corner of the back. A light crease runs east/west just above \"350\" and is also visible from the front. A wrinkle runs north/south between the \"R\" and \"U\" in Drum and is not visible from the front. $2300.\n\nRed Hindu is a Devore, PSA 1....multiple light creases throughout, moderate crease with paper break on front lower right corner, and just a fantastic back for a 1!  $800.\n\nPrices are shipped with insurance....USPS money orders or certified bank checks (7-10 days to clear) are accepted. Would do both for a package deal of $3,000. If you say \"sold\" here in this thread, you get preference. PM's are also acceptable, but cards will be sold to first taker!\n\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/bam002.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd37/geckster109/rh001.jpg[/IMG]",
