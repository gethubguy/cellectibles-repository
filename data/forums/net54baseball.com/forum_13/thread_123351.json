I'd be interested in several of the Series 7 cards as well as the Series 3 orange borders and would be willing to pay over cost to get these.  \n\nI don't need the Kelly Mascot though so I'm not out to try to snag that card at least :)\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]",
