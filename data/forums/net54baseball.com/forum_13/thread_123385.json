      "post_content": "Looking to raise funds for a vintage bicycle purchase.  Anyone interested in this Johnson at $600 delivered (slightly less than the cardpricer average)?  Card has brilliant Piedmont 150 colors and no creases, a tiny surface wrinkle upper left, under magnification what I think may be a tiny paper loss above his right eye (now evident in the pics), some tobacco staining on the rear and the boarders/corners shown in the scan.  Edited to add pics since my scanner sucks.\n\nIf you want to check it out on VCP, I paid $565 on 2/7/09 on eBay (during the darkest days of the Great Recession).  \n\nPayment would be by Paypal.  \n\nemail [url]jlynch@capspart.com[/url]",
