Might have been mislabeled, maybe supposed to be a mc qualifier because the card is exceptionally tall or maybe psa gave it the mk qualifier because there is the faint image of the tolstoi back on the front of the card but i have never seen a mk qualifier given for a wet sheet transfer... Idk ???",
