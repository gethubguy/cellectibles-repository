I REALIZE I HAVE MY HANDS FULL IN COLLECTING 500+ CARDS THAT ARE 100+ YEARS OLD. USING THE  EBAY SITE, I HAVE PURCHASED A FEW \"COMMONS\" IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT. THE GRADES HAVE BEEN PSA 3s. \n\nMY FIRST QUESTION IS - WHAT IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY GRADERS, PSA VS. SGC, ETC?... \n\nMY SECOND QUESTION IS - HOW MUCH CAN I EXPECT TO PAY FOR COMMON PLAYERS PSA 3s?\n\nLASTLY, IF THERE IS ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT HAS ANY T206 CARDS (GRADED OR NOT) FOR SALE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.\n\nI CAN ONLY DREAM THAT SOMEDAY I'LL BE A PROUD OWNER OF A MAGIE, PLANK OR THE WAGNER CARD. ONE CAN DREAM, RIGHT?? :)\n\nTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME !\n\nPETE[STRIKE][/STRIKE]",

      "post_content": "First off,\n\nWelcome Pete.  \n\nIn my personal opinion there are only three legitimate grading companies for prewar issues (SGC, PSA and BVG).  Each of these three tend to follow reasonably similar grading standards.\n\nAgain my opinion is that its better to collect the card not the plastic slab that surrounds it.  I like to buy cards that are 'raw' (aka unslabbed) because they tend to be cheaper that way.  However for nice conditioned items like (ex/5 or better) it's usually safe to buy them in a slab so that you know that the cards are less likely to be trimmed or altered.\n\nCommon PSA 3s will tend to sell for about $35 each.  Some cards will be more either because of their scarcity, popularity of the player or the brand of back they contain (those without sweet cap and piedmont are more desirable).\n\nAs for sale cards I have roughly 200 duplicates ... almost all are raw and most are roughly \"Good / 2 condition\" --- even though some are better.  Shoot me a line if you want to know more or have other T206 questions.\n\n[url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
