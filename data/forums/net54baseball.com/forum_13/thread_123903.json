      "post_content": "Hello all.\n\nI am new to this forum, as well as to the T206 set. I posted in the main forum about myself a bit. I have started a collectibles investment partnership and am looking to try to amass about as much of a master T206 set as I possibly can. \n\nMy thinking is that the best way to get this going would be to purchase a massive existing T206 collection and build up from there.\n\nI am going to try to amass this collection of front/back variations in VG condition or better (staying closer to VG to keep costs down). I see large lots go for sale at REA and Legendary and the like...good stuff but lots of Pr-Fr-Gd in those lots too. If need be, I will go that route...beggars can't be choosers after all. \n\nBut if anyone out there on this forum is serious about selling their large collection of T206 cards, please email me at [url]tom@regalfinancialgroup.com[/url]. \n\nI realize there are some 4,000+ known front/back combos...so I'm looking to start with a large foundation. At this time I am not looking for a lot that is less than 500 cards. If you may potentially be interested, or if you know of someone who may be, please drop me a line.\n\nI am excited to be part of this forum and hope to get to know many of you in the years to come.\n\nTake care.\n\nTom",
