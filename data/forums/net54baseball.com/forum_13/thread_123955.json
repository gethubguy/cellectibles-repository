      "post_content": "Soon after I found this site a few months ago I posted my wantlist of T206's with the goal of trading my duplicates for the cards I needed.  \n\nBut judging by how few reponses I got, I think my request was flawed because collectors who may be attempting a set do not have many duplicates to deal.  Or not.  I can't be sure.\n\nEither way, in an attempt to entice more of you to respond I would like to offer you 2 commons for every 1 common t206 you trade me.  Same for HOFers.\n\nEssentially I'm saying I'll give ya a good deal.  And sure we can include some cash as needed.\n\nI'm looking for non-graded cards in at least gd+.  The cards I have to trade are in varied conditions averaging about gd+ as well.\n\nWhy would I prefer to trade?  It's either because I acquired most of my cards by 1980 when the hobby was more about trading.  Or it could be because I'd find it pretty funny that in 2010 some of us would actually be trading t206's the same way kids did in 1910.\n\nProbably for both reasons.\n\nI hope I can give you a great deal on the cards you're looking for and complete my set while doing so.  Thanks for looking.   -peter\n \nLong Lists below.....\n\n\nNEED THESE T206\u2019s\n\nBarry Phil Al\nBridwell Port.\nDahlenBost.
