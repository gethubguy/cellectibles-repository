I am gettin my feet wet in the vintage arena and wanted some opinions on this so pardon my ignorance...\n\nA pastor in my town has this card for sale. He wants $575 for it. It is a Piedmont back and obviously trimmed. Questions? Thoughts? How is the price? \n\nI would appreciate any expertise on this. Thank you :D\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=19436&d=1274713616[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=19437&d=1274713631[/IMG]",
