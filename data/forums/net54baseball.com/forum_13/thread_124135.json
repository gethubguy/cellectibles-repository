      "post_content": "Hi, I didn't really see a great place to introduce myself so I figured I'd do so by explaining what I'm attempting to collect.  \n\nI've been collecting T206 cards for about ten years and have acquired a small collection of quality cards.  Now that I'm a few years removed from college and actually have the funds to spend on cards again, I've decided to focus my efforts on the Washington T206 team set.  Currently I only have the Elberfeld (fielding) and Conroy (batting), so I'd be interested in any of the other cards.  Thus far my collection only consists of PSA 5 and above but I don't have to stick to that, especially for the other Elberfeld and Johnsons.  By the way the Johnson portrait is my favorite card, I've dreamt of owning it since I was young.\n\nAnyways I look forward to learning more and hopefully contributing to this forum.  If you can help me out with any of the Washington cards or point me in the right direction, thank you in advance.\n\n-Kyle",
