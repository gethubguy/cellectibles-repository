      "post_content": "Due to an overwhelming response, I have added prices and pictures to this post rather than answer all emails directly.  Upon further detailed review, a few of the cards did have some technical issues which can be seen in the scans or I've detailed accordingly.  Prices quoted are for check/money order.  If you wish to utilize Paypal, add an additional 2.5% or you are welcome to pay in a manner where I incur no fees.  I will entertain cash offers on most cards and in any quantities.\n\n\nI recently acquired a group of T206 that included a couple dozen very high end, crease free, T206 that look anywhere between EX and NM but have a purple stamp on the reverse: \"OCT 2 1911\".  Unless they are some type of manufacturing samples, I can only assume an original collector stamped these on the date they acquired them back in 1911.  A few examples are shown below for reference (all backs are a version of Piedmont or Sweet Caporal and some were stamped twice).\n\nIf you have any interest in obtaining a piece or two for your set or collection, please email me for scans and prices (I will respond with scans as I get time to make them this weekend and I will only respond to emails, not posts). \n\nEmail - [url]ppgustafson@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nI have the following players/teams:\n\nAlperman - Brooklyn ($150)\nAmes - NY ($60)\nBates - Boston ($75)\nBell (side arm throwing) - Brooklyn ($60)\nHulswitt - St. Louis ($150)\nHunter - Brooklyn - ($90)\nMagee (batting) - Philly ($OLD)\nMarshall - Brooklyn ($80)\nMcQuillan - Philly ($85)\nMurray (Portrait) - NY ($100)\nOverall - Chicago (creases top right) - ($65)\nPfeister - Chicago ($90)\nPhelps - St. Louis (light creases near top right) - ($70)\nSeymour (batting) - NY ($150)\nSpencer - Boston (tiny spec of paper loss at start of right shirt sleeve) - ($115)\nStarr - Boston ($90)\nSteinfeldt (Portrait) - Chicago - (very small crease near bottom right - tough to see) ($85)\nSweeney - Boston ($90)\nTenney (Portrait) - NY ($90)\nWiltse (Portrait) - NY ($95)\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampf.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampfb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampbb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampfc.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampbc.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampfd.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampbd.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampfe.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/datestampbe.jpg[/IMG]",
