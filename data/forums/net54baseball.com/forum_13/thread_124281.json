      "post_content": "I have an extra 1911 Piedmont cigarette slide and shell box available for sale.  The box is in very good condition overall.  Has a beautiful 1910 tax stamp on back with what appears to be a 1911 overprint (although the ink is a little difficult to read - see the photo below).  The pack also retains a few original cigarettes.\n\n$150 shipped.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0004.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0002.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0001.jpg[/IMG]",
