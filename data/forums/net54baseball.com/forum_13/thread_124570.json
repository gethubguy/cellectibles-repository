      "post_content": "I am looking to trade my T206 Coupon Cigs (aka T213-1 Coupon   :D ) card of Christy Mathewson for a comparably scarce/valued card(s) of Walter Johnson.  WAJOs I am looking for include the tougher backs of T205, T206, and M101-4/5 as well as other tough issues such as E123.  Matty has a mild crease at the lower left corner, but is otherwise a very nice card, IMO.  These pics (digital camera) were taken before I sent Matty to SGC - came back as a SGC 30, which surprised me, as I thought (hoped!) it would be a 40.  Having just acquired a scanner, I can send scans of Matty in the SGC holder to anyone possibly interested in a trade.",
