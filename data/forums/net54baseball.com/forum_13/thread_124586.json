      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have for sale one of the scarcest and most sought after T206 Southern Leaguers.\n\nFor sale is a T206 Shag Shaughnessy SGC 60 with an Old Mill back. The card is beautiful. It is graded SGC 60 with very nice corners, perfect centering and perfect color and registration.\n\nThe price of this card is $950 which includes shipping and insurance. I do not have PayPal, so I would like to be paid with a US Postal money order. I will ship out the card on the same day that I receive the payment. \n\nIf you are looking for a high-grade T206 Shag Shaughnessy, you will be very pleased with this card. I have scans below.\n\nTo buy the card, please send me an E-mail at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nThank you.\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-429b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-429rb.jpg[/IMG]",

      "post_content": "I apologize for the price on this card. I got greedy and over-priced it. I thought that $1000 was a fair price for the card but I tried to get an extra $200. So for my excess greed, I will lower the price below what I thought was fair. The new price is $950 and that includes insured shipping.\n\nThere are some Shag cards out there. I have not seen one this nice in a long time.\n\nTo buy the card, contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]",
