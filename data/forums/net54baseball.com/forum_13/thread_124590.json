      "post_content": "Ok this is a fun one.\n\nHall of Famer John McGraw with a double name and a Tolstoi back.  Card is really nice with strong colors.  It has one solid crease that does not break color and really displays much better then the grade.\n\nCard has full name on bottom and about half on the top.  Back is super clean and nice.\n\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/bbct206mcgrawdoublename.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/bbct206mcgrawdoublenamebk.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/bbct206mcgrawdoublenameclose.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLooking to trade for some Boston Store Cards I need.  I might consider a crazy cash offer as well.  \n\nEmails before posts.\n\nThanks\n\nJames G",
