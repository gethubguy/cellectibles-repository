      "post_content": "I'm still slowly grinding out progress on the T207 set.  I'm looking to buy or trade for any of the following cards, preferably in lower condition.  I have over 400 T205, T206, T207 cards available to trade including MANY Hall of Famers, Southern Leaguers and short prints.  I also have a few low grade E90-1's and E95's as well as a few mid-grade Imperial Tobacco C46 baseball and C56 hockey cards.  I will include scans of some highlights below.  I'm not looking to sell right now but please feel free to e-mail me with any trade offers, large or small.

Just trying to cross a few more off the checklist.  I have traded the Keeler and McGinnity cards from the scans above but all others are still available as well as more than 50 T205 and T206 HOF'ers, many T206 SL'ers and hundreds of other commons, short prints, and stars from the T205, T206, T207, E90-1, E95, C46, and C56 (hockey) sets.  Thanks for looking.",
