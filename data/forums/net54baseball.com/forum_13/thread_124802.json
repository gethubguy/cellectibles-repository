I'd call it G-VG, but it is miscut along the bottom so only the top half of the lettering shows.\n\nI also have a Phillippe with Sweet Cap 350 Fact 30 back.  The front looks VG-EX, but it appears to be slightly trimmed.  The back has some paper loss - looks like it may have been glued into a notebook.\n\nOtherwise, there doesn't appear to be any creases, scuffing or paper loss.\n\nI'd like to sell them as a pair for a total of $35 delivered.\n\nIf you're interested, either PM me or shoot me an email and I'll make scans for you.\n\nBest regards,\nCraig",
