I think it received the 40 grade because of two light scratches on the front where the P (for Portsmouth) is located. Other than that, the card is very nice.\n\nThe price is $125 and that includes insured shipping. I accept a US Postal money order or check. To buy the card, send an E-mail to: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url].\n\nIf you are collecting in this grade, you will really like this card.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-304b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-304rb.jpg[/IMG]",
