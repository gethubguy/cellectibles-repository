      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nBoth cards are sold. Thank you.\n\nI have two T206 Southern Leaguers for sale today, both are graded SGC 50. \n\nThe cards for sale are Pat McCauley and William Otey. The cards are very nice for the grade. The price of each card, delivered and insured, is $200. However, I would prefer to sell both as a lot. So if you want both of them, I will sell them as a pair for $365.\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-3041b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-3041rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-362b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-362rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTo buy either or both of these cards, send me an E-mail at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]",
