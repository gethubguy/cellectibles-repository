      "post_content": "Hi all, I'm fairly new here but was looking to get started with some low grade (raw or graded) T206 Brooklyn cards. My grandfather passed recently and grew up in in Brooklyn so I figured I'm going to start there and see what I come up with!\n\nI'm a long time modern collector just now dabbling in Pre-War cards. I kind of fell in love with them when I came across a bunch in person at a local antique shop. I plan on making a few purchases over there this weekend.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n[url]willbbc@gmail.com[/url].",
