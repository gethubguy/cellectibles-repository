      "post_content": "Hello all, I have the following card which it pains me to offer, but offer it I must. I prefer to trade but will accept cash if necessary. A T206 Nap Lajoie (throwing) SGC graded 40/3. This is one of the nicest 40's you'll ever see. Should be a 50 IMO. No creases and only minimal corner wear. Back is a Piedmont 150 and is very clean. I would like to trade for a T206 Johnson portrait (my card and cash) SGC 20-40 or a SGC graded (20-40) T3 Turkey Red (see my pervious post for my want list or email me). Cash price would be $230 (what I paid, I can't take any less) shipped with del. conf. (ins. extra if you want it) Paypal (+3%), check or m.o. all ok. Send offers and scans to: [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nThanks!\nSOLD - Thanks Dave!",
