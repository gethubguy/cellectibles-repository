I'm always looking for trades, especially T202, T205, and 1952 Topps (beaters permissible).  I'll also sell if I don't get a trade, so send an offer if you want.\n\nTake Care,\nGeno\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/WillsFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/WillsBack.jpg[/IMG]",
