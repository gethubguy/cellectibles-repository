      "post_content": "to your larger point...I have really just gotten back into my vintage cards in a bigger way and I have been a little shocked at how much they have gone up.  \n\nI would think if your stuff is super high-end, it would probably be a good enough time. The Middle of the Road stuff, the economy will probably hurt you.\n\nThe big question is, what would you do with the money that you would prefer to owning your cards?   I had a friend who sold his collection to buy a convertible, and honestly think he regretted it. It's a nice car and all, but he misses the people he used to associate with and even a nice car is just a car. \n\nMy minister collected comic books.  He is a wonderful man who everyone loves and had amassed as nice of a collection as anyone of ordinary means could ever hope to.  But he came to a point where he felt that the collection and the time and effort required to pursue his collection was getting in the way of his relationship with his family and with God. He sold the bulk of his collection and donated the money to charity. He has no regrets. \n\nIf you have bills, would like the security of paying off your home (which is nice), have a charitable concern that is close to your heart, I'd consider it.  If you're just a little bored, there's nothing wrong with waiting a little while...something will spark your interest again. \n\nIt all comes down to the answer to the question: In what way will the proceeds of selling my collection allow me to do something I enjoy more?",

A sort-of mini-Net54 convention and card show. No swarms of the unwashed shiny card masses, no square miles of shmata. Not beholden to pencilling out huge arena floor space factors and other logistical concerns. Sounds great on paper.
