      "post_content": "Thanks to those of you who have recently traded with me - it was fun.  And while I still have over 100 raw t206's to trade, I thought I would now offer cash in exchange for raw t206's listed below.  \n\nI'm looking for raw vg or better.   Ideally, I'm looking to get as many as possible in a deal from those willing to give a bit of a discount for purchasing multiple cards.\n\nIf you want to send me your lists as well I'll gladly send you scans and help you with your needs.   Thanks again\n\n\n\nBarry Phil Al\nDahlenBost.
