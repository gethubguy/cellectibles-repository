      "post_content": "I am looking to find a low-grade T206 Speaker to add to my Red Sox (Americans) team set. Below are some of the things I am looking for:\n\n1. Less than $200\n2. Prefer graded PSA or SGC, but will consider others\n3. Less concerned about corners and edges than about an unbroken front surface to the card. \n4. No trimmed or horribly disfigured cards.\n\nThat being said, those are only wish lists (except the price one). I will look at any Speakers that anyone has, even if you just want to show off some high-grade one that I have no chance of buying just to make me feel bad :)\n\nThanks!",
