      "post_content": "Hello, as usual I know this is a long shot but if anyone has any Winchester   \nT210 Series 6 cards avaliable I would like to buy them.  I currently have two, a fred toney and a Goostree with bat.  As far as something I have that I would trade, I have a cabinet photo of the Maysville Rivermen team that I would consider trading for some winchester cards from the set.  I have recently decided to focus only on the winchester team from series 6, that being my hometown.  If anyone has any for sale please let me know through the board or at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  If anyone is intersted in the cabinet photo in a trade let me know and I will send scans.  The photo was sold to me by our fine fellow board member Rhett.  As always thanks to everyone on the board for all their help in my Bluegrass league projects so far.\n\nWilliam",
