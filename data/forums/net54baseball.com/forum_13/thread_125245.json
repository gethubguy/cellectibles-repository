The T209 is an absolute blazer and would grade EX if it weren\u2019t for the minor crease at the bottom right corner, it\u2019s one of the nicest examples from the set that I have seen. Shipping is on me.\n\n\nT209-2 Forque: $250\nT210-8 Lot (I will break this up if a few parties are interested): $650\n\nThanks for looking and please write with any questions.\n\nZach R.\n[url]Mzm55@mac.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/IMG_0001.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/IMG_0002.png[/IMG]",
