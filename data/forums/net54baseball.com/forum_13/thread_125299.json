      "post_content": "If anyone is interested, I have a Doyle with Sovereign 350 back that I would be willing to trade for another Doyle with a common back. The card is not in that great condition, but it is presentable.  \nIn return, I would either ask for an upgrade on the Doyle I have in terms of condition or the same condition Doyle but with common back plus addition of some T206 cards that I don't have (I don't have close to 300).\n\nEmail me at [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url] if you're interested in such a trade.\n\n[URL=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cdD-UXWHBPGCTmiXGDPB1w?feat=embedwebsite\"][IMG]http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Ys7fw31kTDs/TCvs3eiAc1I/AAAAAAAAH70/rcDCZBAgzjA/s800/JoeDoyle_Sov350.JPG[/IMG][/URL]",
