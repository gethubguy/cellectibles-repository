The ink is not as bright in person as it comes out in the scan, but it is certainly there and visible.  \n\nLet me know if anyone has any trade thoughts.  I'm not collecting specialty backs right now and am currently only collecting HOFers, but I would take $$ as well, of course.\n\nThanks for looking.",
