      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\n\nBeen lurking around the last few months.  Love the site.  I've recently gotten back into cards after a long layoff and love the tobacco and candy cards.\n\nI just picked up a bunch of T206s at a yard/garage sale.  I posted a couple of threads and am looking to sell or trade them for another HOFer.  I already have this Willis card in a higher grade, so I'm looking to sell or trade this as well.\n\nIf anyone wants to make me an offer on the bunch, I would certainly be open to any offer.  For sale, I'd like to get $30 for this.  Seems like there is a similar condition one on VCP for $33 recent sale.  Open to trades as well.\n\nThanks for looking,\n\nJason",
