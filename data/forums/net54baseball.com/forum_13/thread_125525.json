Callahan Winchester\n4. Scherenberg Paris Portrait Variation\n\nI focus on Winchester but there are a few cards I have searched in vain for that I would like to get.  My wantlist includes\n\n1.Creager Richmond\n2.Viox Lexington\n3.Vanlandingham either team variation\n4.Any Frankfort Player or other Winchester Players\n\nThe only card I do not want to trade from my list above is the Toney card. The others I will be happy to consider a trade for.  If anyone is intersted in trading for any of these please email me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \nAs always if anyone has anything from my wantlist for sale also please contact me also.  Hope to here from a few fellow T210 collectors.
