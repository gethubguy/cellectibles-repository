      "post_content": "This is a wonderful die cut soldier advertising sign for Recruit, complete with an image of the original pack.  The sign is 100% ORIGINAL and dates to 1910-1915.  It truly would be the perfect companion piece for a T207 or advertising collection.\n\nOverall size is 28 inches by 14 inches.  The condition is wonderful with minor blemishes that do not detract from the overall appearance.  There are three small tack holes where the sign was hung at one point and the left shoulder pad has a crease.  The back is also very clean and display evidence of there once being an easel present.  \n\nThis is the first and only die-cut soldier sign I've ever seen.  SOLD.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/7.jpg[/IMG]",
