It is graded SGC 60 with very nice corners, perfect centering and perfect color and registration.\n\nThe price of this card is $915 which includes shipping and insurance. I do not have PayPal, so I would like to be paid with a US Postal money order. I will ship out the card on the same day that I receive the payment. I will accept a check, but I must wait until the check clears before I ship the card.\n\nIf you are looking for a high-grade T206 Shag Shaughnessy, you will be very pleased with this card. I have scans below.\n\nTo buy the card, please send me an E-mail at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nThank you.\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-4291b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-4291rb.jpg[/IMG]",
