      "post_content": "Hello everyone I put a trade list up not to long ago but I thought I would give up the ghost and dive back in to collecting this entire set and not just the winchester team.  If anyone has any series 6 cards for sale I am intersted. The board has been so kind to me I thought I would try it again.  I am looking for any card from the set.  I currently have \n\n1.Cornell Frankfort Portrait\n2.Haines Lexington\n3.Toney Winchester\n4.Goostree With Bat Winchester\n5.Callahan Winchester\n6.Scheneberg Paris\n\nI am especially looking for cards from teams I do not have a player of because I would like to get a player from every team in series 6 so richmond,maysville,and shelybville will take priority.  Winchester is my home town so those cards are always high on the wantlist.  As always I am always willing to discuss a trade if I have a card someone really needs as I have sold cards to fellow collectors on the board in the past since I know this is a tough set.  I am always up for talking with fellow series 6 collectors also. If anyone has anything avaliable please email me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] or through the pm on the board.  Thanks \n\nWilliam",
