      "post_content": "As many board members know, I'm trying to put my T213-2 set to rest. I need 8 more (see below) and would love to trade these dupes for the ones I need. If not, I'm happy to sell them too. \nthanks, Andy\n\nMy T213-2 Wantlist:\nDemmitt (NY on Shirt)\nMagee (Phila caption)\nMcQuillan (Phila caption)\nMurray (Chicago)\nReulbach (Brooklyn Fed)\nSweeney (Richmond)\nTinker (Chicago Nat, Bat on Shoulder)\nWheat (Brooklyn)\n\nAvailable:\nA note on condition - the HOFers are all PSA-1 - for the life of me, these are about the nicest PSA-1s I own - see the scans. The backs are all clean and  have no paperloss, smudges or writing.\n\nBaker New York Amer - not as difficult as his Phila Amer card, but much tougher than his Philadelphia Amer version was $160 now $135\n\nBender Philadelphia Nat - this is a difficult card because it was only issued in 1916. Check out Ebay and you'll see how many Philadelphia Amer versions there are, but not Philadelphia Nat SOLD\n\nCollins Chicago Amer A on shirt - the most difficult of the three Collins variations SOLD\n\nCrawford was $150 now $125\nGriffith was $150 now $125\nJennings both hands - was $150 now $125\nMarquard portrait NY Nat - was $150 now $125\nTinker Chicago Fed Bat Off Shoulder was $150 now $125\n\nQuinn Vernon PCL - this is a tough card, issued only in 1916, one of three PCL cards in the set (the other two are both Frank Chance) SOLD",
