      "post_content": "Looking to put together a solid foundation for this set. I already have a bunch of HOFers, but the set is so big that putting together individual commons will take forever, and ebay costs will be massive. If anyone has a chunk of commons to sell me, I'd be interested. \n\nI don't have a ton of money to spend, so I'm not looking for cards that are in amazing condition- can be trimmed, bent, worn, have paper loss, have holes, etc. I'd probably be willing to buy dupes as well if you want to get rid of them.",
