Liberty Album\n\n\nThese are not cards.\n\nI am interested in selling. Based on my online research it looks as though some pages may have been trimmed. I do not see holes for string binding. Not sure.\n\nSomeone mentioned cutting cards from albums. This seems as though it would devalue them.\n\nSome are blank back (Champions). The inventors have printing on the backs as do others.\n\nI can email photos.",
