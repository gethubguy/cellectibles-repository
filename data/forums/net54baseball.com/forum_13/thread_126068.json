      "post_content": "I have the following T206 Lot for sale.  Sixteen different cards, including four hall of famers and the pesky Lundgren Cubs variation (all with Piedmont backs). Price for the lot (including shipping) is $450 (paypal, check, or money order). Email address = [url]agonzdude@yahoo.com[/url] (this is not my paypal address...)\n\nThe Lundgren has a nice front with no creases but some paper loss on the backside.  The Waddell is SGC graded (fantastic eye appeal for the grade with no creases, but has two pinholes in the upper border).\n\nLovely Day...",
