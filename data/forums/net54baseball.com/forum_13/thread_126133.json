The boys in Parsippany had another opinion.  Joss didn't cross.  There is a small spider wrinkle on the L border a little above his eyes it extends to about the part in his hair.  It is barely visible in the scan.  There are also a couple of spots of color loss in the background -- right above his part and in the UR corner.  These appear to be very small surface abrasions. \n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ltsgallery/memberfolderssv/srs1a/mycards//willis_port_PSA45_tn.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWillis also did not cross.  SGC said the card was trimmed.  I sent the card back to PSA and they said it was fine.  \n\nIf interested, please respond to this thread.  thank you",
