      "post_content": "WTB- T206 commons in PSA 3 grade, preferably medium size lots of  5 or more cards to make for more efficient transactions and minimize shipping costs. Criteria for graded cards: Don't like dirty cards or cards with off registration (out of focus), no paper loss on any part (front or back), corner wear ok, minor creases are ok as long as they don't detract too much from the presentation of the card. Please be prepared to send scans of cards.  I will be traveling later today for the weekend so please be patient with response time as I will have no computer access.\n\nPlease send a message to my mailbox with any opportunities.",
