I wasn't aware of that.\n\nI searched around first but didn't turn up anything, but now that you mention it I searched again and realized I've overlooked an Archive post from the old board where this took place.\n\nI'd like to keep my reputation clean so I am definitely not going to involve myself in any referrals to this gentleman.\n\nThanks.",

I prefer to overpay for my t206s one at a time, not in bulk :)... not saying it is overpriced, just that it seems to be to be priced at about what you would expect to pay with some shopping individually.",
