      "post_content": "It looks like this is turning into a cather's tale!\nBack in the day, I pissed off my centerfielder, who was money on the throws to the plate.  He a big arm and knew were to put them.  We played a team the was very good at the old hit and run and hard nosed as hell (Van, WV), which means you are going to see some action with a contact pitcher on the mound.\nIn the second inning my guy in center put in three throws high right and had his release pretty much measured up to insure that I was gonna get killed.  Sure enough, I took 5 direct hits from the runners in that game.  Mr. Center and I also went a round in the dugout during the game after I accused him of getting me killed.\nAs with all catchers, the bigger the beating and the hotter the weather, the better I hit.  That game was the shining point of my days behind the plate (I played second regular, but our catcher had bad wheels and a scholarship, so I ended up getting a lot of work behind the plate to keep him alive)!  If only the box score could show the beating I took.\nGood luck in the search for T210 mitmen!",
