      "post_content": "CARDS ARE SOLD\n\nAbsolutely breaks my heart to sell this...and so soon after almost completing it.  :(  Thanks to everyone on Net54 who helped me assemble it.  I hope it goes to a good home.  Thanks to some unwelcome family drama, I'm having to raise some cash, and quick!  While baseball cards are a love of mine, in the end they are just a hobby and family must come first, so I'll be taking a hiatus for an indefinite amount of time.  C'est la vie!  This is my third and last ad I'm listing on the B/S/T, the rest will be sold on eBay in the coming weeks...I've got at least $5k into this set, but will take the first reasonable offer that comes along.  Please PM or e-mail to [url]jmpkcp@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThis back set is missing ONLY a very common version (Sweet Caporal 350 Factory 25)....so it should be easy to complete.  \n\nHere's what I've got:\n\nBlank Back (SGC Authentic)\nPolar Bear (PSA 3)\nSweet Caporal 350 Factory 30 (PSA 4)\nTolstoi (PSA 5.5)\nCycle 460 (PSA 5)\nBroad Leaf 460 (PSA 1.5)\nSweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 25 (PSA 4)\nSweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 42 (PSA 1)\nSweet Caporal 350-460 Overprint (SGC 50)\nRed Hindu (PSA 1)\nOld Mill (PSA 1)\nEl Principe De Gales (PSA 5)\nPiedmont 350 Factory 25 (PSA 5)\nSovereign 350 (PSA 6)\nPiedmont 350-460 Factory 25 (PSA 5 and PSA 6)\nPiedmont 350-460 Factory 42 (Raw but I guarantee a numerical grade)",
