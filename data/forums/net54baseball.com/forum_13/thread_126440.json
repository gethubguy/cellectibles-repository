      "post_content": "I will be set up at this year's East Coast National in Westchester County August 19-22 looking to buy collections of tobacco cards (sports and non sports cards). I will also be selling the same--including pre-1900s through 1910s, 1920s through 1940s, and 1950s through 1960s.\n\nI will be set up to the left of the main entrance in the first row second booth opposite the restaurant. This will be my first East Coast National in 8 years as I tend to cruise at that time - but I am cruising later this year instead.\n\nYou can contact me in advance to determine whether I am interested in what you have to sell, and whether I have what you want to buy. \n\nSteve Sabow\n914-522-3853\n[url]Dynamictwo@aol.com[/url]",
