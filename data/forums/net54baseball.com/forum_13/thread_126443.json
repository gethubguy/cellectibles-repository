      "post_content": "Hello it is that time again for another one of my plea's for any Winchester  \nT210 series 6 cards that anyone might have avaliable.  I focus on the winchester team in this series as it is my home town.  I have three winchester players at the moment.  I also have a small grouping of other t210 series 6 cards I would trade for winchester players.  Depending on the player I will even trade 2 cards for one.  If anyone is intersted in trading or if anyone has any winchester players for sale send me a message at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] and I will send you scans and a list of non winchester players I have.  Here's hoping I hear from some fellow board members soon.  Thanks\n\nWilliam",
