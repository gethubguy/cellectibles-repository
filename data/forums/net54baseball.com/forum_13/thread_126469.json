      "post_content": "In a stroke of brilliance at the National, I purchased the following T206 Lajoie portrait with a brown Hindu back for $900. The brilliance lies in the fact that I unknowingly already had a T206 Lajoie portrait with a brown Hindu back at the time of the purchase. Not wishing to be like Noah and have two of every Lajoie card in my collection, I'd like to sell the one I just bought at the price I paid. I'll even cover shipping and insurance.\n\nIf it helps, this card was not displayed on the dealer's table. I asked whether he had any T206 Lajoies with tougher backs, and he retrieved this one from behind his table. I'm not making this up. I'm not sure whether the dealer would mind me saying who he is. The trouble is, I don't know.\n\nAlso, I have not posted this card in the August pickups thread on the main board. But if it will lead to a sale, I'll be happy to post it there and say how much I love this card and that it's staying in my collection for a long, long time.\n\nLet me know if you're interested.\n\nThanks, Rob",
