We can either post cards that we have for trade or put up a list of cards that you need. That way we have a list of people working on the set that would want to work out trades along the way!\n\nI will start with the cards I have available for trade:\n\nAll cards are good to vg and raw\n\nPhillippe (Pittsburg), piedmont 350\nPickering (Minneapolis), piedmont 350\nTitus (mustache man, Philadelphia), piedmont 350 TRADED\nMyers (new York giants), sweet cap 350\nRhodes (St Louis), el principle de gales TRADED\nBrain (Buffalo), sweet cap 350\nMcCormick (new York giants), piedmont 350\n\nSouthern Leaguers:\n\nMolesworth (Birmingham), piedmont 350 TRADED\nHelm (Columbus), old mill TRADED\n\n\n\nIf any of these cards interest you and you wanna trade let me know. I need about 318 cards in the set, so there is a good possibility that you probably have a card I need!\n\nJeff\n[url]Jwilliams81@Mac.com[/url]",

I have a few duplicates that I'd be looking to trade:\nPowell as PSA 4 and PSA 5.5 -- can trade either one for a similarly graded (PSA) of a different horizontal card\n\nDougherty (arm in air) - polar bear back, ungraded, will aim to post scan later today, probably GD-VG condition\n\nPhillippe - Piedmont back, ungraded, roughly GD-VG condition\n\n\nAlso have several SGC-graded cards for which I'd like to switch over to PSA, simply for consistency with the rest of the graded part of my collection which is mostly PSA (although I do think the SGC grades make for nicer cards).  Can trade these for similar condition PSA cards, of identical players or similar commons:\nKleinow (Boston), polar bear back, SGC 60\n\nMaloney, SC 350 back, SGC 60\n\nOwen, SC 150, SGC 60\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like scans/photos.\n\nThanks,\n--S",
