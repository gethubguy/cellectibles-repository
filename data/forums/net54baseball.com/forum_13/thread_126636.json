      "post_content": "Hi, I am selling a T206 Ed Walsh.   Ed is a HOF'er who was the last pitcher to win 40 games in a season.\n\nThis card has some corner and edge wear, along with some light creasing, plus some small spots of paper loss in the flesh colored areas on his face.\n\nPaypal is fine, with no extra charges.  Money orders or personal checks also work.  The price includes shipping and insurance for $95 shipped and insured.\n\nThanks, Rick\n\nemail is [url]rickmcquillan@gmail.com[/url] or send me a pm.",
