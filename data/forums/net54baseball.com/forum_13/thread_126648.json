      "post_content": "T206 Johnny Evers Portrait Card, SGC 40 - see scan, absolutely beautiful in every way - dead centered, vibrant green background, nice clean Piedmont 150 back.  Undergraded (I know, we all say that ..) Only reason I can figure it got a 40 is tiny crease in the very top left corner.  Have to hold at angle to see.  \n\nI paid $230 w/tax and shipping (June '09), that's what I'll sell for.  I won't bump lower - my only list of this, have 2 of them, so thought I'd try to sell this one .. otherwise I'll keep it :-)  Price includes shipping, PayPal (Payment Owed) OK.  \n\nThanks!\n\nEd",
