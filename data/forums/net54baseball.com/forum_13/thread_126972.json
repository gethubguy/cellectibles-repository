Beautiful card, only a little corner wear upper right keeps it from being graded even higher. No creases or paper missing. Trying a new scanner so please bear with me :o\nFirst email or post wins the card $275.00 which includes shipping and insurance. Thanks. SOLD!\n[url]trophybob@sbcglobal.net[/url]\nBob",
