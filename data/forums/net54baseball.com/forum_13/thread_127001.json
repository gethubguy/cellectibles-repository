      "post_content": "This lot consists of 119 T206 reprint cards.  All of these were printed in the 80's by Renata Galasso.  Some of the back are red, some blue and others black.  There are a variety of backs with the majority being Piedmont. One or two cards have wear, otherwise they are in excellent condition.\n\nPrice for the entire lot is $15.00 (including first class shipping).  Please email me if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/t206reprints5.jpg[/IMG]",

They all have perforated borders?  What's the cardstock like that they're printed on?  Is it like a normal card or paper thin?  Thanks for any help.",
