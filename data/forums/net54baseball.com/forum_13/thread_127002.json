      "post_content": "Hello everyone.  I purchased these cards with the hope of using them to trade for low grade winchester cards from the series 6 set. I have not been able to find anyone that wanted to trade for winchester cards so I am offering these three up for sale.  I would like to sell them as a group or trade them for winchester cards.  Please send offers for individual cards or the whole group to [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  I am not going to put a price on them because I have been off lately on what buyers want to pay, so just let me know what you would like to pay for them and we can go from there.  Also as always if anyone has any winchester players I will trade multiple cards for a individual winchester player.  Thanks\n\nWilliam/Tony: I really have to use one name on all my posts.lol",
