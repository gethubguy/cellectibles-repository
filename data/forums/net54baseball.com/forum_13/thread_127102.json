      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI am looking to buy a group of graded T206 cards. I would prefer a larger group, but would entertain thoughts on a smaller group. I would accept PSA or SGC cards in the 3-4-5 range, 2's are OK if they present well.\n\nI am willing to pay a fair price, but not retail for a group.\n\nSend me what you have with a price to [url]cyrilp@visuallink.com[/url].\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
