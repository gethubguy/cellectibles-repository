      "post_content": "This is the only card needed to complete my St. Louis Cardinals T205 subset.  I don't mind if the card is graded or raw and the condition doesn't matter to me.  In fact, I don't want to spend more than $200 on this card (if possible).  Creases/wrinkles are fine but I'd prefer not to have writing or paper loss on the card.  Please let me know if anyone has this card that might fit this description.\n\nThanks,\nAaron Cowan\n[url]acowan19@gmail.com[/url]",
