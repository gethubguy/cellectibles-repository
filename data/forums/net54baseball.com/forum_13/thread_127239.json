      "post_content": "Hello.  I'm looking to buy or trade for the last 22 T207's that I need for my set.  I will take them in ANY condition, even total beaters.  I figure that a bunch of people may have upgraded with cards from the set that was listed on eBay recently...so if you are looking to get rid of your dupes, I'm your man.  Will gladly pay reasonable market prices and/or have lots of T205, T206, T207, E90, C46, C56, etc tradebait available including MANY HOF's and short prints.  Thanks for looking and here's what I still need:\n\nT207:\n\nBescher\nBirmingham\nBlackburne\nBushelman\nCicotte\nDonlin\nDonnelly\nEllis\nEngle\nFisher (white cap)\nHoff\nKuhn\nD.
