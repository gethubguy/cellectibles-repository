There are no marks on these cards; however, there are some hard-to-see impression lines on the backs from pencil marks that have been carefully removed using a high polymer eraser.  All of these cards are higher-end for the grade in my view.\n\nPrices include shipping.  First committed email gets the card.\n\nThanks.
