I don't collect T3s, so I want to sell it or trade it for something else.  \n\nI have exactly $142 in it, so I will sell it for $145 ($3 shipping).  However, I prefer to trade it for raw/graded T206.\n\nGreat eye appeal, but it has 3 tack holes.  Nice corners, no creases.  \n\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Vintage%20Cards/T3Wilson.jpg[/IMG]",
