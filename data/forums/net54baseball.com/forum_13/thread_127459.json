      "post_content": "Hi all, \n\nI have a few HOF Ramly's that I need to sell from my personal collection.  They are Bender, Collins, and Griffith.  The Griffith has sharp corners, but unfortunately a small vertical wrinkle up the center of the card, and has some wear to the back (possible scrap book type stuff, but maybe not since the damage is pretty minimal).  The Bender probably grades out as g/vg ish, small wrinkle on bottom right corner, but other than that a pretty good looking example (back is clean).  The Collins has the best picture of the lot, really sharp, probably grades out to about g/vg as well with a few light corner wrinkles, and the back is pretty clean.  See the scans, let me know what you think - would like to move these quickly, but only if the price is right.  The scans are located here:\n\nBacks: [IMG]http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac42/memerick2/baseball%20cards/IMG_0591-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nFronts: [IMG]http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac42/memerick2/baseball%20cards/IMG_0592.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLooking for $285 for Griffith, $315 for Collins, and $350 for Bender.  Can maybe do a discount on the lot if you want to buy all three.  Can send additional digital camera pictures if you want, I tried to get photos that represented the cards as much as possible.\n\nThanks.",

      "post_content": "Received a bunch of offers already, especially on the Bender.  I'm suprised how much interest they've generated this quickly, but I would really like to sell the whole lot at once given the interest level, rather than individually.  Going to stick with $950 on the lot given the interest level, and I'm starting to wonder if I've underpriced them at this point.  Several emails about the size of the cards:  They all measure out at 2 x 2.5, and if need-be, I can post scans of the cards next to a ruler.",
