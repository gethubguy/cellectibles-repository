As my focus is on the front, back variations are not a consideration.  Would like good price.  Do not want slabbed, but if they are cheap enough I will bust them out....Even small pieces of card are ok...they will be appreciated...please pm or email\n\nAbbaticchio, Ed     Boston Rustlers    \nAdkins, Doc     Baltimore (ML) \nAmes, Leon     New York Giants \nArcher, Jimmy     Chicago Cubs \nBall, Neal     Cleveland Naps \nBarger, Cy   full B   Brooklyn Superbas \nBarger, Cy   partial B   Brooklyn Superbas \nBatch, Emil     Rochester (ML)    \nBescher, Bob     Cincinnati Reds  \nBirmingham, Joe     Cleveland Naps    \nBransfield, Kitty     Philadelphia Phillies   \nBresnahan, Roger   mouth open   St.Louis Cardinals   \nBridwell, Al     New York Giants \nCady, Hick     Newark (ML) \nCarrigan, Bill     Boston Red Sox \nChase, Hal   both ears show - frame extends   New York Yankees \nChase, Hal   both ears show - frame ends   New York Yankees \nChase, Hal   left ear shows   New York Yankees \nCicotte, Eddie     Boston Red Sox   \nCollins, Eddie   mouth open   Philadelphia Athletics \nCollins, Jimmy     Providence (ML)  \nCrandall, Doc   t crossed   New York Giants \nCriger, Lou     New York Yankees \nDahlen, Bill     Brooklyn Superbas \nDevore, Josh     New York Giants \nDickson, Walt     New York Giants \nDonohue, Jiggs     Chicago White Sox  \nDougherty, Patsy   red sock   Chicago White Sox \nDougherty, Patsy   white sock   Chicago White Sox \nDunn, Jack     Baltimore (ML) \nEgan, Dick     Cincinnati Reds \nEngle, Hack     Boston Red Sox \nFletcher, Arthur     New York Giants \nFord, Russ   black cap   New York Yankees \nFord, Russ   white cap   New York Yankees    \nFrick, James     Newark (ML)  \nFromme, Art     Cincinnati Reds \nGaspar, Harry     Cincinnati Reds \nGoode, Wilbur     Boston Rustlers \nGraham, Peaches     Chicago Cubs \nGriffith, Clark     Cincinnati Reds \nGroom, Bob     Washington Senators \nHanford, Charles     Jersey City (ML) \nHarmon, Robert   both ears show   St.Louis Cardinals  \nHartsel, Topsy     Philadelphia Athletics   \nHoblitzell, Dick   Cincinnati Reds  \nHoffman, Danny     St.Louis Browns \nHummel, John     Brooklyn Superbas  \nJacklitsch, Fred     Philadelphia Phillies \nJennings, Hugh     Detroit Tigers   \nJohnson, Walter     Washington Senators \nJoss, Addie     Cleveland Naps \nKarger, Ed     Boston Red Sox \nKleinow, Red     Boston Red Sox \nKling, Johnny     Chicago Cubs \nLange, Frank     Chicago White Sox \nLaPorte, Frank     St.Louis Browns ]\nLee, Wyatt     Newark (ML) \nLeifield, Lefty   A.
