      "post_content": "PSA 2 - obvious paper loss on back, but beautiful front and no creases whatsoever.  Front has scratch on top border where the two tones of red come together.  There also appears to be a slight stain or glue residue on front at the same place.  The stain is very minor and visible when turned into certain light.  It comes down to the bill of his hat and you can see it most in the shade of the white.  I'm being super nit-picky in describing this, but really it's a beautiful \"2\".  Without the paper loss on back, I'm thinking it would be a \"4\" but alas...\n\n$50 shipped.  SOLD",
