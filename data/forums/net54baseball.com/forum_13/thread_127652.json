      "post_content": "Hi, I have been slowly working on a T206 Boston Americans team set. I'd like to try and knock another one off the list. I would prefer graded (PSA or SGC), but will certainly consider raw as well. I am looking for cards in the VG range to EX range, but since its a collector's set, I am more interested in how they look they then how they technically grade. I prefer soft corners to creases. Any back is good.\n\nAnyways, here are the ones I'm looking for:\n\nBill Carrigan\nEd Cicotte\nHarry Lord\nHarry Niles\nTubby Spencer\nHeinie Wagner (Bat on Left Shoulder)\nRed Kleinow (I know this is a rare one, so I'm less picky about condition)\n\nThanks for looking!",

Front is VG-VGEX, but has toning on the back corners from the old interst style scrapbook.\nHere is a pic.\n\nThanks, card will ship the first of the week!\n\nThanks and good luck,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206TolstoiKleinowBOSfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206TolstoiKleinowBOSfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206TolstoiKleinowBOSback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206TolstoiKleinowBOSback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
