I now am hoping to pick up a T206 portrait of Tinker and Evers to finish the trio in a similar quality and price (assuming they go for around the same as the Chance).  Hopefully someone will be willing to part with what I'm looking for :) .....or if I'm way off with what I'm hoping for in terms of price, I'd appreciate the enlightening.  Thanks.\n\nEric\n\n\nps. I'm hoping for nice eye appeal even in the low grade as can be seen with the 2 Chances recenly posted.",
