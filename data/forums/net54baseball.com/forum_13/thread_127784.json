      "post_content": "Hello everyone, I am looking to buy low grade Chicago cubs cards from the\nT206 set.  Something in the PSA 1 or 2 range graded or ungraded.  I do not have any of the cubs cards so anything you have I need.  They can be a little nicer condition if they are not the star players.  If anyone has anything avaliable please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] or through the board.  Thanks\n\nTony T",
