      "post_content": "First of all, if anyone can tell me how to post scans on this thread i will do it immediately. I purchased this card in sgc's infant years, at least 12-13 years ago. This card looks more like an 8 than it does a 4 or 5. Sgc said very faint paper wrinkle held it back. I still can't find it, however, an esteemed colleague thinks it might be in the left white border of the card. I have looked at it under a loupe, and don't see it. But having said that, even if it existed, how can you smash this card by up to 4 grades?? Corners are 8's or darn close to it, beautiful color and registration, bright white borders. I have collected t206s for over 15 years, and this is the real deal. Looking for an \"8\" quality lajoie, but don't want to pay $6k? This is for you. Selling price $950 or trade for other high grade t206. Thanks-kevin  SOLD,THANKS SCOTT!",
