      "post_content": "Hi all,\nI snagged this one last week for a good price, but don't need it.  I would consider trading for a graded VG Old Mill Shag to add to the backs line, or a bunch of beater SLers, HOFers or commons to add to the beater hoard of raw goodies.  I wouls also love to trade for a beater T204 Eddie Collins or an American Beauty Eddie Collins.\n\nJohnny already has this one, so worries about stepping on his toes!!\n\nYou can also buy it for $MOVED TO EBAY delivered.  Paypal gift is preferred.  A commitment to buy comes first, unless a trade has been agreed upon by both parties.  Sorry for the bad scans, but that is the best I can do with SGC slabs.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url] \n\nAlso, this is not the best looking SGC 40 around.  It is dirty, and looks to have two tiny spots of paper loss on the back.\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206Cycle460BenderNoTreesSGC40front.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206Cycle460BenderNoTreesSGC40front.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/?action=view&current=T206Cycle460BenderNoTreesSGC40back.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206Cycle460BenderNoTreesSGC40back.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
