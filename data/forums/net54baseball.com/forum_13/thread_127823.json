I currently have three cards and thankfully an original photo postcard of the winchester team thanks to a fellow board member.  If anyone has any T210 series 6 winchester players please message me through the board or at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \n\nAs always thanks for the help in chasing down cards from my hometown team.\n\nTony Turner",
