      "post_content": "Oh, sgc! Here we go again. Just like the t206 lajoie sgc 50 that i listed and sold in a couple of days, this card is the exact same horror story! Corners that are 8 quality, perfect centering, snow white borders, perfect reverse. Oh, yes, a faint paper wrinkle that i can't see! A recent psa 8.5 sold for $8k, this card is an absolute ripper! No stains, beautiful color and focus. Selling price $750 or trade for high grade t206s. Thanks-kevin",
