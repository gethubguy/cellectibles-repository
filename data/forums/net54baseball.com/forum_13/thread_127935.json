      "post_content": "SOLD/Pending  Hello-  I've got this T206 Hal Chase for sale.  I'm asking $45.00 (shipping included).  This was in an original find that included two Demmitt (St. Louis variations).  I realize it doesn't increase the value of this card in anyway, but I thought it was kind of interesting.  Please email me at [url]jpcw1999@yahoo.com[/url].  Paypal preferred.  Thanks, Jeremy",
