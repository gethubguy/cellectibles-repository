      "post_content": "Hello everyone, I just picked up a T210 Series 6 Womble sgc 40 and I would like to trade it for some other series 6 cards I am looking for.  The card has been cracked from its case but I still have the tag and to my knowledge it is the only womble that has been graded by SGC or PSA.  IT is a very strong grade for a T210 card.  I am primarily trying to complete the winchester team first in series 6 so if anyone has any of them they would like to trade for this one please let me know.  I am also looking for some other non winchester players as well so if anyone has any T210 6's they would like to trade for this one please let me know.  The Scan is attached below. You can message me through the board or send a email to [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \n\nThanks\n\nTT",
