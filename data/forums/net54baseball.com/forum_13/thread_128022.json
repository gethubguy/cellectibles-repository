I know they exist.  I'm going to take another run at this run of cards, but this time I'm going to start with the Hindu.\n\nSo if you have one that you're willing to sell or trade, drop me an email and hopefully we can work something out.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.\n[url]richard@richardarmstrong.ca[/url]",
