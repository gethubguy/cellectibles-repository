      "post_content": "For sale below are some key variations and rarities from the T3 Turkey Red set.  The McIntyre and Paskert are team variations and a bit harder to find.  The Rhoades and Myers are relative rarities and the Dool\"in\" variation is easily the toughest T3 to find (with Tenney NY & Bos a very close second).  Pfeister and McFarland included on the list for good measure, as they aren't rare, but available for sale.  As a note, the latest Legendary auction offered a complete set, card by card, and the only card not offered was the Dool\"in\" variation.  I am happy to send front and back scans, will consider offers and volume discounts as well.\n\n\n28. McIntyre - Brookln & Chic - PSA-5(MK) - beautiful card, tiny mark - $450\n33. Pfeister - raw, extra clean, no creases, would probably grade PSA-4 - $325\n50. Chief Myers at Bat - SGC-40 - difficult card - $450\n90. Dool\"in\" - rare variation - toughest card in set, erased pencil on back - PSA-4(MK) - $1250\n112. Paskert - Cin & Phil - PSA-3  - great card $350\n114. Rhoades - pinhole, otherwise a gem, rarest \"regular issue\" card in set - $650\n58. McFarland (T9 boxer) - PSA-3 - $250",
