      "post_content": "Listed for sale is an 18 card lot featuring a nice assortment of different caramel and tobacco types and sets.  As is apparent by the scans, all cards have serious condition issues such as trimming, paper loss, damage, heavy creasing, etc.  Still a good way to knock some cards off your checklists or add a few new types to your collection for a bargain price.  \n\n$150 takes the entire lot delivered.  First e-mail or PM saying \"I'll take it\" reserves the lot.  Thanks for looking and please e-mail [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions.\n\nCards pictured are as follows:\n\nT207 - Ed (Dixie) Walker\nT206 - Mike Donlin\nT206 - Thomas Leach\nT206 - Vive Lindaman\nT206 - Dan McGann\nT206 - William O'Neil\nT206 - Lou Ritter\nT206 - Fred Snodgrass\nT205 - George Stone\nE90-1 - Lou Criger\nE90-1 - George Stone\nE90-1 - George Stovall\nC46 - Ray Demmitt\nE95 - Thomas Leach\nE95 - Harry Krause\nE96 - Harry Davis\n1933 Goudey - Fred Schulte\n1934-36 Diamond Stars - Earle Averill #35 HOF",
