      "post_content": "Just picked this up and I haven't found anyone with other T210 series 6 cards to trade for it so I would like to sell it.  To my knowledge it is the only womble that has been graded.  The card has been cracked out of its case but it still has the sgc tag.  I am asking 125.00 for the card but I will take offers also. The back is very clean.  If anyone has any winchester T210 6's I will trade this for one of them as that is the team set I am trying to complete.  Please send me a message at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] if you want the card or want to make an offer etc.  Thanks\n\nWilliam",
