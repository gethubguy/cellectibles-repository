Right now I'm looking for a handful of T206's and haven't seen these come up in a while.  Anybody have any of the following 5 cards in PSA 3-4 range?\n\nBay\nBender (No Trees)\nBowerman\nBransfield\n[STRIKE]Brashear[/STRIKE] - purchased!! Thanks Pete\n[STRIKE]Breitenstein[/STRIKE] - purchased!! Thanks eBay\nBridwell (with cap)\n\nThese are the next 5 on my list and if I pick any of these up I'll add the next cards to replace them.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBrian",

      "post_content": "Hey Brian,\n\nI have been doing the same thing as you for almost a year now.  I had started my T206 collection by picking up whatever I needed with very little focus.  I know focused my collection to the first 100 cards with an emphasis on the first 50.  I only collect SGC50 or better (No PSA).  I will tell you from experience that the Bay is very tough.  If you find one, you will pay more than you think.  I also think that Bender and Breitenstein are very difficult as well and again, the price will be high.\n\nGood Luck!",
