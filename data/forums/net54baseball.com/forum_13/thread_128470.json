VBC Forum B/S/T...moderator can delete that other post!!!\n\nI'm hoping someone on the board can help me out. I've had finding a decent T205 Pryor McElveen on my mental checklist for some time now. This was THE first \"old\" baseball card I ever had and sometime back in the early 1990's I lost track of it. Not sure if I sold it or traded it or just lost it. Anyway, I want to replace that card in my collection (along with both 1957 Topps Sal Maglie and Al Worthington). Does anyone on this board have one lying around in decent shape they'd be willing to sell me? By decent shape, I mean no creases and decent centering, but I don't really care about the corners. Maybe the equivalent of a PSA 3? I'm really just interested in nice eye appeal. Thanks in advance...Matt\n\nPS...I saw there is one on eBay but it is in rough shape so I passed. \n__________________",
