I am just starting my interest in this set and I do not have any of the cards yet but I would like to start with these two as they are the more difficult ones to find I believe.  The conditon on these cards do not have to be perfect, low condition examples are fine.  If anyone has either of these cards avaliable please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \n\nAs always thanks for all your help\n\nTT",
