Goodwin just auctioned a slew of Obaks and I picked up four or five of the last cards I needed but I screwed up and bid on the 1910 Swain instead of the 1911 card. It now remains the last card I need to finish. If you won the 1911 Swain or if you have one you would consider sending my way, please let me know. I have an extra 1910 Swain, other trade bait, American cash money and lotsa good karma so I'm sure a favorable deal can be struck.\n\n<!-- BEGIN HTML CODE -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" src=\"http://hosting.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/bbbofsfirstclass/vancouverandvictoriaobaks\"></script><noscript>To view this photos album, please enable Javascript in your browser.
