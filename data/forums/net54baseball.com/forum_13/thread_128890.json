      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI upgraded this Collins card a couple weeks ago, so looking to sell my extra Collins Old Mill.\n\nThe Collins card was in an old PSA holder with a 2 on it.  It looks a lot more like three to me.  No paper loss.  Corner damage top right, surface crease right hair high. tiny surface indent (not a hole) on the right side, southeast of the ear, as you look at it.  The back is bright white and looking great.\n\nLajoie is a very nice and bright card, and has also been in a PSA 3 holder in the past.  TRADED\n\nCollins is off for grading, I will relist upon return!\nThe Lajoie has been traded!!!\nPaypal is prefered, emails come first.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/?action=view&current=T206CollinsOMFront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/T206CollinsOMFront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/?action=view&current=T206CollinsOMBack.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/T206CollinsOMBack.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206SC150649Lajoiefront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206SC150649Lajoiefront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206SC150649Lajoieback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206SC150649Lajoieback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
