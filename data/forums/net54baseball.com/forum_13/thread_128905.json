Technically it's probably only vg because of the pencil at the top of the card and a minor wrinkle that doesn't show unless tilted in the light. However, as you can tell, it presents much nicer and is an absolute gorgeous card from a very difficult set.\n\nI am asking $600 DLVD for this card. Please email me or post here if you're interested.\n\nBest,\n\nZach\n[url]mzm55@mac.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/ltsredsun.jpg[/IMG]",
