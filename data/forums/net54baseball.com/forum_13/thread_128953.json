      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI am looking to buy a group of T206 cards. I would consider a smaller group. But I'd prefer at least 25 cards in the group. I want PSA or SGC graded cards. They can range from PSA2/SGC 30 up to PSA5/SGC 60.\n\nYou can contact me through the Net 54 E-mail or send a message to me directly at [url]cyrilp@visuallink.com[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
