      "post_content": "The card has been SOLD. Thank you.\n\nHi,\n\nI have a T3, Turkey Red, card of Home Run Baker for sale. It is a beautiful card that has great eye appeal. However, I am told that the card has been re-colored. I can't see it. But I am disclosing this because the card will probably not get a numerical grade from PSA or SGC. However, if you want a beautiful Turkey Red of this Hall of Famer for a fraction of the price, then this is a very nice card.\n\nThe price is $300 delivered. You can contact me either through the Net 54 E-mail or directly at [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nHere is the link to view the card:\n\n[url]http://www.cyscards.com/t3/03-078.htm[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy\n[url]www.cyscards.com[/url]",
