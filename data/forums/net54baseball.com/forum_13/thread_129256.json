      "post_content": "Still working on my complete super-print run of Frank Chance Yellow portrait.\nLooking to trade this T206 Frank Chance Yellow with Tolstoi back, SGC 40/3 for another rare back of the same card.\n\nLooking for T206 Chance Yellow with American Beauty 350, Sovereign 460, Cycle 460, Carolina Brights, EPDG or Piedmont 350-460/Fact 42.  Prefer graded to ungraded (as I will have the card graded); either SGC or PSA.\n\nWould consider the right T206 Lajoie Portrait, Johnson Portrait, Mathewson Dark Cap/White Cap, Young Glove Shows or I could even toss in some cash for a low grade Cobb Red Portrait. Also T205 Matty Honest/AB/Pied Fact42 or possibly other tobacco/caramel HOF considered.  Prefer graded to ungraded; either SGC or PSA.  Send me an offer by PM or email me at [url]DHarford@satx.rr.com[/url] .\n\nThanks\nDave",
