I have been wanting a Lajoie T206 Portrait for a long time and Christmas is around the corner, so anyone who has a Lajoie Portrait with either a rare back (1.5 grade at the lowest) or graded 4.5, 5.5, or 6 with a more common back, please contact me. It would be a happy holiday if I could find one. Thank you,\n\nAndrew",
