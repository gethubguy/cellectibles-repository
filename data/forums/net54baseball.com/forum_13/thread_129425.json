      "post_content": "Card is beautiful and well centered. Corners stronger than the grade, closer to 7's in my oppinion than 6's.  Could easily be candidate for upgrade. It has been in my collection for 15 years, and i have never resubmitted it. Would prefer to trade for higher grade t206. Offered at $450 straight sale.  Scans can be available tomorrow. This is definitely a very high end 6. Thanks-kevin",
