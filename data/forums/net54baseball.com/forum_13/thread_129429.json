      "post_content": "I have something in my life coming up that will divert my attention away from my T206 set for a quite some time.  After some consideration, I have decided to continue to pursue the HOFers in the set, but not the complete set as I had once hoped to do.  All of the cards in my registry are for sale or for trade.  Most are Piedmont / Sweet Caporal, but there are also some Polar Bear, Sovereign, Cycle and Tolstoi.  \n\nI really don't need the money so I prefer to trade the cards for T206 SGC HOFers or other pre-war HOF issues.  However, the cards are for sale as well.  In addition to pre-war, I would be willing to trade for vintage Topps baseball sets/lots/HOFers from '50s-'60s.  I'm open to any trade ideas, but in particular I am looking for '54 Topps Banks, Williams (both) Aaron, Kaline and Mays.  \n\nHere is a link to my registry.  I will try to delete the cards as I move them.  I will use the valuation tool on T206.org for all sales / trades.\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=239&userset=4747[/url]\n\nBack scan available upon request.",
