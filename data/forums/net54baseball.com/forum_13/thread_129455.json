      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI am looking to trade into a 3 Finger Brown with a Hindu back.  I would like to have a nice clean card around VG.  It can be lower as long as it presents well.  Either pose is fine with me.  I would like to match it up with my Tinker, Evers, Chance trio of tougher backs.\nTrade, or cash and trade is doable.  If the Lenox CHI Shirt is around, I would like to see it, but may be out of range, but would be happy to work on something.\nLet me see what you all have.  Thanks for the time,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
