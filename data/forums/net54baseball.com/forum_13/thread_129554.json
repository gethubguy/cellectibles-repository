      "post_content": "I've decided to collect in SGC only. Would like to trade my PSA for SGC. Looking for cards of similar grade and value. I do what to disclose that the first 7 scans were submitted to SGC for crossover but did not cross at an equal grade so i kept them in PSA holders. Would like to see scans.\n\nPlease PM me with any offers\n\nThanks,\nStuart\n\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img061.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img062.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img063.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img065.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img066.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img067.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img068.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img105.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img106.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/pics/img107.jpg[/IMG]",
