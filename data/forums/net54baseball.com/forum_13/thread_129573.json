They average G to VG, 2 or 3 a bit short of that, several better, a few pretty nice. \n\nHere's a scan of the Stengel card.\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/53StengelMaysvilleT210OldMills-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAnd here's all of the Winchester players...  with the tough Goosetree leaning on the bat.\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/T210OldMillWinchester300.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nI will not respond to messages sent through Net54. Please don't use it.\n\nPLEASE us my email, [url]fwakefield1@comcast.net[/url] if you are interested.\n\n\nHere are the Lexington Colts cards...\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/T210OldMillLexingtonColts.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAnd here are the cards for Richmond...\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/Richmondplayers.jpg[/IMG]",

And it looks like I may well break these guys up and sell them individually. I have 3 lists already, and I think one more is on the way...\n\nFrankfort, the gap is for Angermeier fielding which I lack.\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/T210teamFrankfort.jpg[/IMG]\n\nParis\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/T210teamParis.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMaysville - Shelbyville (Same team, they moved from Shelbyville to Maysville during the 1909 season.)\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j106/greatwake/T210teamMaysvilleShelbyville.jpg[/IMG]",
