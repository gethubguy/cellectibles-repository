      "post_content": "Absolutely stunning card, well centered with razor sharp corners. Mk designation is for a small \"p\" written in the extreme bottom right corner. Clean back. Card looks more like an 8 than a 7, but grading on vintage cards is normally more critical when there is a mk qualifier. Smr price for a straight psa 7 is close to $4k. Will sacrifice for $1500. Detailed pics available. Thanks, WOULD CONSIDER TRADE FOR HIGH GRADE T206S.",
