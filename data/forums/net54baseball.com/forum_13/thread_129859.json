      "post_content": "Another blazer! Also features a rare black back that demands up to a 30% premium. Card is perfectly centered with razor sharp corners. Mk designation is for a small \"ss\" written at the extreme lower right corner. This obviously was to indicate short stop. This card has an extremely rare psa population. Last i checked, there were only 4 graded higher than a psa 6! Pics available upon request. A bargain for only $750. Thanks, would consider high grade t206s for trade",
