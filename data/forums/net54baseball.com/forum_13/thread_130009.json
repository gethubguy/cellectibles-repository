It doesn't bother me, but it might make it more of an even trade].  I'll include scans of the best I have to offer; you can take your choice.  The 206 Strang isn't bad, but a bit stained, worse on the back.  The 205 Bergen is a real nice looking card, but is either miscut or trimmed [the right-side measures okay, but the left side is short.\n \nAs I say, I'm only just learning to navigate on Net54, so please advise me if you think you can be helpful.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug Doremus",
