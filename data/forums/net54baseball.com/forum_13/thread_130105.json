      "post_content": "Hello all,\nSGC 40 Merkle Throwing Uzit has been sold, Thanks\nEmails have priority, email address is below.  EDIT: Looks much better than the scan, as I have a hard time with the SGC holders.  I think this was from the REA Uzit thing a few years ago.  This is not the one sold earlier this summer in one of the auction house things, just an FYI.\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nEDIT:\nSince the last round of silver cash and trade offers worked out very well (thanks guys!), I will put the offer in this thread also.\n\nWill also trade for 1964 or earlier silver coins\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206UzitMerkleThrowfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206UzitMerkleThrowfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/?action=view&current=T206UzitMerkleThrowback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/T206%20Backs%20Line%20Newest/T206UzitMerkleThrowback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
