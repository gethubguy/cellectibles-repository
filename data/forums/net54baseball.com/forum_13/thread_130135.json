I know that there are at least a couple of other board members looking for some of these same cards but I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need:\n\nBirmingham\nDonlin\nDonnelly\nFisher (white cap)\nKuhn\nMcCarthy\n\nI have tons of tobacco and caramel cards available to trade including many HOF'ers and short prints.  Would also be glad to buy.  Condition is of no concern at this point so a beater with bullet holes looks gem mint to me.  Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any offers.  Thanks for looking!",
