      "post_content": "Hello.  I have the following three T206 Hindu backed cards available to trade.  Cards pictured are:\n\nIsbell\nKonetchy\nMcQuillan\n\nThese are all obviously low grade but still tough cards and it seems that prices on Hindus in ANY condition have been going through the roof lately.\n\nI'm not especially looking to sell these right now but I would love to trade these for similarly valued pre-war tobacco/caramel/etc cards.  I collect just about everything and condition is not a big deal.  Would especially be interested in T204, T210, T213, T215, any E90-1, E91, E92, E93, E94, E95, E96, E97, E98, E101, E102 and so on...\n\nPlease don't hesitate to send any offers as I'm always eager to make a trade for something I don't have.  Thanks for looking!",
