Let me know if you want me to email bigger scans or anything else.  (My scans honestly make the cards look a bit darker than they should - I think they look nicer in person.)  Thanks for looking!\n\nPSA 5: ($100 each)\n\"Chase Gets Ball Too Late\" Egan / Mitchell\n\"Bush Just Misses Austin\" Magee / Moran\n\nPSA 5MK: ($70)\n\"Nearly Caught\" Bates / Bescher (MK due to some wet ink transfer on back)",
