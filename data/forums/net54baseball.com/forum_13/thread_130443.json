      "post_content": "I'm looking to pick up a Cycle 460 back card for my T206 back set.  I currently have one but want to send it to a more deserving home.  However I'd rather not create a hole in my collection without knowing what it will take to replace the back type.  If anybody has a Cycle 460 in a PSA 3-5 or SGC 40-60 range for any of the following players, please let me know.  If my lists are correct these all should be available with a Cycle 460 back.  Raw would be fine as well but it should grade out in the desired range.  You'd be making two collectors very happy.\n\nWID CONROYWITH BAT\nDOC CRANDALLWITH CAP\nJOSH DEVORE\nMIKE DONLINWITH BAT\nPATSY DOUGHERTYARM IN AIR\nTOM DOWNEYBATTING\nLARRY DOYLEPORTRAIT\nLARRY DOYLEWITH BAT\nCHICK GANDIL\nRUBE GEYER\nHARRY HOWELLHAND AT WAIST\nED KONETCHYGLOVE NEAR GROUND\nJOE LAKEWITH BALL\nJOE LAKENO BALL\nTOMMY LEACHBENDING OVER\nLEFTY LEIFIELDBATTING\nRUBE MANNINGPITCHING\nFRED MERKLETHROWING\nDANNY MURPHYBATTING\nRED MURRAYPORTRAIT\nCHARLEY O'LEARYHANDS ON KNEES\nFRED PAYNE\nED REULBACHNO GLOVE SHOWING\nADMIRAL SCHLEIPORTRAIT\nADMIRAL SCHLEIBATTING\nCY SEYMOURTHROWING\nJIMMY SHECKARDGLOVE SHOWING\nFRED SNODGRASSCATCHING\nHARRY STEINFELDTWITH BAT\nGEORGE STOVALLBATTING\nGABBY STREETCATCHING\nHEINIE WAGNERBAT ON RIGHT SHOULDER\nDOC WHITEPITCHING\nED WILLETTS\nHOOKS WILTSEPORTRAIT, WITH CAP\nHOOKS WILTSEPITCHING\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBrian",
