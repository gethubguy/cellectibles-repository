      "post_content": "Hi-\n\nEdited to add new commons.  Price on commons $90 each for two or more.  Make an offer (w/in reason) on the McGraw.  \n\nMcGraw No Cap PSA 4 - $175\n\nCommons PSA 5  -$95 each\nKrause portrait \nPhillippe P350\nSeymour port SC 350-460\nThomas P350\n\nCards are nice and sharp with very good colors.  My scanner leaves a little to be desired.  Backs are good, but ask for a scan if you're the type who would ask to return a card because you didn't like the back.\n\nPaypal add 3%, shipping included.  Thanks.  Jim\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=28762&d=1291846118[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=28765&d=1291846177[/IMG]",
