      "post_content": "Hello everyone, I have decided to get rid of the majority of my T210 series 6 cards.  I have a lot of four I would like to sell.  They inlcude 4 winchester players.  All of these cards have been purchased from fellow board members over the last year.  Here are the 4 I have for sale:\n\n1. Goostree With Bat: In a SGC A holder\n2. Cornell Winchester: This is the nicest of the four\n3. Kircher Winchester\n4. Callahan Winchester\n\nScans are attached below.  I am asking $400.00 for the entire lot.  That is not a bad price considering these are very tough to find.  I will be happy to consider offers though and I may also sell the cards individually.  If interested email me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  Thanks\n\nTT",
