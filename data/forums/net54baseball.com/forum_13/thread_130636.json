      "post_content": "Hello,\nI know there have been quite a few T3s available on the board recently, but here are a few different ones.  Just in time for the 100 year anniversary of T3 (technically they began production in 1910).  I am happy to send front and back scans of any of the cards - just showing the Joss here in order to conserve space.  Here's what I have:\n\nJoss - PSA-A - see scan, a tiny clip of the bottom right corner probably keeps it from being graded a PSA-4.  Very clean card front & back - $400\n\nGriffith - PSA-3 - great color & focus, clean back - SOLD\n\nCollins - PSA-3(MK) - Super clear focus and color - erased mark on the Turkey Red ad-back gives it the MK - SOLD\n\nWallace - PSA-4 - great card, hard to find, clean ad-back, books for $825 - asking $750 - grab it.\n\nCrawford - raw - pinhole in each corner, otherwise very clean front and back - SOLD\n\nMeyers at Bat - SGC-40 - very tough card, very clean - $450\n\nPfeister - PSA-4 - great color, clean - $425\n\nMcBride - PSA-3.5 - such a beautiful card from the difficult second series - $400\n\nAmes - PSA-4 - niceer than most out there, clean ad-back - $375\n\nMcIntyre (Brooklyn & Chic) - PSA-5(MK) - a few tiny pencil marks on the back? not quite sure about the MK, otherwise clean & bright f&b - $400\n\nRhoades - raw - 2 tiny p/h, corner crease, light back stamp, great corners, awesome color and focus on this difficult card - $500\n\nLet's make a deal!\n\nHapy collecting,\nCraig",
