      "post_content": "Hello - I'm down to the last few T206 now to complete a set.  Some of the typical harder to find cards, a few HOFs, SL'ers and even some commons - just tougher lately to find in a \"reasonable\" (as in VCP range or thereabouts) price mid-grade condition.  Some of these I have, just in lower grade - looking to upgrade.  Looking for nice eye-appeal, any holder (PSA/SGC/BVG) - graded 4 to 6 if possible.  \n\nI also have some dupes and others to trade if that's an option.  Many thanks, in advance, for your time and anything you have here that you may be looking to sell/trade!\n\n*Bill Cranston\n*Cy Young (Bare Hand)\n*Cobb (Green)\n*Joe Tinker (Bat On)\n*Joe Tinker (Hands at knees)\n*Tom Guiheen",
