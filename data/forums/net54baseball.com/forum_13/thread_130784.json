This was caused by the inadequate shipping and packaging of the individual who sold this card to me. I guarantee that the card was not harmed by the crack.\n\n[IMG]http://www.freewebs.com/majormajor/photos/T3-Collection/img003.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.freewebs.com/majormajor/photos/T3-Collection/img004.jpg[/IMG]",
