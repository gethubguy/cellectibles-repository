      "post_content": "Collins is now only $220 plus $5 for S & H.  I will cover the remaining S & H and will insure the card.  First buyer couldn't get the money.  It has corner wear and two light creases at top left corner.  Also, there is a small tear in the left border.  I assume it is a tear, but I didn't want to pull it apart to see if it was a crease or a tear.  But, I think it's a tear.  the Chase card and the Willis card are sold.\n\n[IMG]http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii21/dbuck01/IMG_0024.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii21/dbuck01/IMG_0025.jpg[/IMG]",
