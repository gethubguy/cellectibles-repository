SGC Authentic.  $175 delivered -- SOLD\n\nAs you can see, the card has a tear at his shoulder level that extends about 1/2 an inch.  It also has tape on the back at the tear area.  No other creases or wrinkles, so it presents surprisingly well despite those obvious flaws.  If you're putting together a low-grade set or you have a tear fetish, this may be the card for you.\n\nmy email:  [url]boboinnes33@gmail.com[/url]",
