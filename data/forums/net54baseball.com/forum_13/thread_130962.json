Personally, I think you're grading yourself too harshly (eg some of those \"fairs\" look more like \"goods\" to me), but give you props for erring on the side of caution as the seller rather than act greedily.\n--S",

I've not measured them, but the edges and corners look to me to be a bit too sharp for a 100 year old card.\n\nThanks and Best Regards,\nCraig",
