      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'd like to add a low grade (Fair/Good/VG) verison of T206 Cy Young Glove Showing before the end of 2010.\n\nAny back is ok,  my only criteria are:  Want to see some of the white border around the entire perimeter of the frame,  would like decent centering,  minor paper loss on front is ok if it doesn't detract from the picture of Cy,  creases are ok,  paper loss on back is ok just so I can read the brand, subjects, factory.\n\nIf anyone has one they would like to sell,  please send scans and asking price to [url]tonyooten@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThanks and have a happy New Year!\n\nTony",
