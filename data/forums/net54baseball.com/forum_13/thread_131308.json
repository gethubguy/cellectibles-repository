      "post_content": "I didn't want to tie up the main forum board with this, since it deals with a purchase, but given that it's a pricey card, and the eBay lister offers little insight, was wondering what people thought of this one:\n[url]http://cgi.ebay.com/1909-t206-Ty-Cobb-Red-Portrait-/220714372460?pt=US_Baseball&hash=item33639a0d6c[/url]\n\nAside from the grainy photos, it passes my first look in terms of border, font, and overall appearance.  And yes, I'd assume it was trimmed.  But even then again, \"too good to be true\" is ringing in the back of my ear.  Can a Cobb even exist with a Fact 42 back?  Do you think it's authentic?\n\nThanks,\n--S",

      "post_content": "I've only been doing this for a year and a half,  but some things that would keep me from bidding are:  the same bidder with low feedback has bid on this a dozen times in $5 or so increments.  Smells like a possible shill.\n\nAlso,  there is no way that an authentic Red Cobb listed properly would slip through the cracks on ebay.  Keep an eye on it,  but if that card doesn't approach $700 to $900 in the next 20 hours,  then I personally would stay away.  (Unless maybe the fact that it is trimmed would keep the winning bid low,  but I still think that card would be no less than $400 to $500 even if trimmed).  The vintage card community will let very very few bargains slip by.\n\nAlso,  he has a 51 Bowman Williams at $10 from the same box that no one has bid on.  It is probably a reprint as well and all the 51 bowman collectors would have bid on this card too.",

But I'd like to know how one can tell by an online photo that a card is not authentic.\nPerhaps this is not a good example as the photo is not clearly focused [which as was pointed out is evidence in itself].  But given a good scan, how can one tell?  As Shaun and Robert say, this one passes the border and font tests I look for.  Is there anything more, examining a scan, one can look for?\nI'd appreciate the clinic.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug",
