      "post_content": "Card has been sold. Thanks for all of the inquiries.\n\nGraded 40/3 by SGC. Scan below was done at 200 dpi, so any imperfections likely will jump out at you. I hadn't previously noticed until scanning that there appears to be a hairline scratch (or maybe a crack) on the front of the slab, to the left (when looking at it) of Joss' nose. I can say with 99.99 percent certainty that this doesn't impact the card itself. When coming up with a price I've taken into account the expense of having SGC reholder it.\n\nPrice: $830 minus $20 for the cost of reholdering (including shipping to and from SGC) = $810 delivered. Check or money order only (if you want to use PayPal, price is $830 delivered).\n\nE-mails to buy the card take priority over posts to this thread. Any questions, feel free to PM or e-mail me (wolfie51sb at aol.com). If you want to propose a trade [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206\"]involving a T206 Lajoie card I don't have[/URL], I'd love to hear it.\n\nThanks,\n\nRob",
