They are for sale at VCP average prices - but I'll pay for shipping/insurance. Let me know if interested. I won't have the cards in my possession until they arrive from Cali ... so I can't help you with scans at this time.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n\nVERY GOOD+ 3.5 1909-1911 T206 EL PRINC.DE GALES ROGER BRESNAHAN WITH BAT SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT 4 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT MORDECAI BROWN CUBS SHIRT - SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD 3 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT FRED CLARKE PITTSBURGH, PORTRAIT SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT 4 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT SAM CRAWFORD THROWING  SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD 3 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT GEORGE DAVIS CHICAGO  $89.\n\nVERY GOOD 3 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT JOHNNY EVERS PORTRAIT  $183.\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT 4 1909-1911 T206 SOVEREIGN WILLIE KEELER WITH BAT - SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT+ 4.5 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT WILLIE KEELER PORTRAIT - SOLD\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT 4 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT CHRISTY MATHEWSON PORTRAIT - $685.\n\nVERY GOOD-EXCELLENT 4 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT JOHN McGRAW FINGER IN AIR - SOLD\n\nEXCELLENT 5 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT RUBE WADDELL PORTRAIT - $344. \n\nEXCELLENT 5 1909-1911 T206 PIEDMONT VIC WILLIS ST.
