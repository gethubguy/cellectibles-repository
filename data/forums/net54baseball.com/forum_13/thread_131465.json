Paypal accepted without surcharge. Sharp card with strong images  -- the grade would be higher  but for ( I assume) the uneven cut along the borders that is not uncommon with this issue.\nStill, a relatively high grade for this set.\nFirst person to accept these terms by emailing me at \nbhodes@rcn.com \ngets the card.",
