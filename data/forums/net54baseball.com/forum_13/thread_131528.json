Well i broke up it into 3 parts. I have no idea on a price. I will sell this individually. Some of the cards have tough backs but 95% of them are common. I know these cards are rough. There are several HOF out of all these big names. Took me about 2hours but i think i got 99% of them uploaded. You can look at the scans below.
