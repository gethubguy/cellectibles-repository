      "post_content": "Hello everyone, I've finally completed the T206 set - everyone except the \"Big 6\" (and hopefully 2 of the 6 in time).  That said, I do have a few I'd like to upgrade if possible and keep consistent with the set grade which ranges between 3 and 6.\n\nI would be interested if you have the following in a 4 to 5 grade (SGC, PSA or BVG) at a reasonable (VCP ballpark) price.\n\n* Al Shaw\n* Hooks Wiltse (Portrait No Cap)\n* George Mullen (Portrait Mullen Variation)\n* Pat Moran\n* Walter Johnson (Hands At Chest)\n* Johnny Evers (Chicago on Shirt)\n\nAll of these I have, just in lower grades.  PM or Email - Sincere thanks for you help in completing to date, the last 25 or so all came from Net54 members!",

There is a part of me that didn't feel like it was 100% complete given I don't have the Big 6.  Not sure how common that is?  \n\nAlso, trying to tie loose ends in upgrading the few I have in lower grade below a 3 or 40 - I guess I'll feel \"more complete\" when I do that .. which is why the post here.\n\nStill, again, thank you for all the messages and help over the last couple years in completing!",
