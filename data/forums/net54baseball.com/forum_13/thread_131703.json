      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI would like to trade one of my extra EPDG backs for a Cycle 350 HOFer.  I have a SGC 50 Bresnahan Bat and would like to trade it for a HOFer with a Cycle.  Looks like I sold my Cycles and kept all my EPDG cards!\n\nMost put a little better money on the Cycle so I would trade my 50 for a nice 40 or 3.  I am open to most players, so let me know what you have.  I have a couple bucks if you have something you would like me to chip in a couple dollars on.  This card is freshly graded with a nice clean holder.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206BresnahanEPDGFrontSGC50.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206BresnahanEPDGFrontSGC50.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206BresnahanEPDGBackSGC50.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206BresnahanEPDGBackSGC50.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
