I'm looking for a T205 NY Giant common, raw or graded, probably in the $20-25 range to go towards another trade.  \n\nA little lower or higher $ may be acceptable too. \n\nPlease e-mail me if you have one available with your asking price including S/H.  \n\nAlso, please provide front & back scans if at all possible.  \n\nThanks!\n\nDonny Muth",
