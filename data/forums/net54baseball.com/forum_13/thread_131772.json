I awoke to approximately 15 or so emails, pms etc, and once I have fortified myself with a couple of cups of artificial life support I will sort through it all to determine who gets what. Looks like there's strong interest in the T209s, the Wheat T202 and the E97s. I'm amenable to offers on the other cards - not looking to get rich here just want to roll some dupes back into the hobby.",

The ink was barely dry on my initial post before the Contentneas and the T202 Wheat were spoken for. Must have been the dreaded East Coast Advantage again I suppose. The E97s went quick, too - just Heinchman remains available. Please feel free to make offers on the Obaks and Fatimas, too.\n\nMy Monday is booked solid but I will mail out all cards on Tuesday. Please make sure I have your mailing addresses by then.\n\nNah. Drink 100% Kona. Way mo' bettah.\n\nCraig: Better get here quick. Moving to Vancouver Island next month and dey no mo' da kine over deah. More about that later.\n\nThanks to all who participated in this BST go-round. Been a pleasure.\n\nPS. Hope you all enjoyed my little YouTube project.",
