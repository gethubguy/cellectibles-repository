      "post_content": "This very nice cut autograph here is for trade. I am interested in almost anything, but especially Chicago and Brooklyn cards...Walsh, Dahlen, Collins, Wheat, Cicotte, Rucker, and Tim Jordan being my biggest wants. \n\nIf you have things for trade please let me know.\n\nI have $130 of value on this. The odd knick in the top right corner is on the PSA case and does not affect the index card. \n\nThanks!\n\nBest way to contact is private message on this site.",
