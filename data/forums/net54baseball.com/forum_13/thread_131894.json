      "post_content": "Hello.  I have the following lot of T206 and T205 Chicago Cubs.  Lot includes several HOF'ers and scarcer backs.  I am looking to trade for tougher type cards such as anything 19th Century, T209, T211, T213-1, T216, E99, E103, etc.  Also working on any of the caramel sets from E90 through E102...AND...would trade in your favor for any of the remaining T207's I need (Birmingham, Donlin, Donnelly, Fisher (white cap), Kuhn, Lowdermilk, McCarthy).  So basically, I collect just about everything and would love to see your tradelist :)  \n\nI would also consider cash offers on the entire lot but am not looking to sell individual cards right now.
