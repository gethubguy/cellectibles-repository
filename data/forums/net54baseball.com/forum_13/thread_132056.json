      "post_content": "Evening Folks,\n\n   Late last year I started to slim down my collection to have a bit more focus.  Am continuing that mission and have the last few C46s to get rid off.  Scans can be seen at [url]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/C46/[/url] and prices include shipping.  I would also consider trades for different backed T206 Joe Kelley cards [of which I currently have none!].\n\nPM me, post in this thread or email me at [url]richard@richardarmstrong.ca[/url].\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.\n\n[lot all sold]",
