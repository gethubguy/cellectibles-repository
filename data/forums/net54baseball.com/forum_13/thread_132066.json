      "post_content": "Greetings everyone! I'm looking to buy a large lot of PSA graded T206 cards, somewhere around 30-50 cards. Looking for commons with common backs in PSA 3 or PSA 4. Paying $20.00 for PSA 3's and $30.00 for PSA 4's. Looking to buy in bulk, trying to keep the price down. PM if you have any for sale and thanks for looking.\nJeff",
