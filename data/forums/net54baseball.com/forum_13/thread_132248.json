      "post_content": "Offering this card for sale because it doesn't fit into my collection.  \n\nT206 Vic Willis Throwing.  Graded 3.5 by GAI.  This was graded by the old GAI.  The back is an Old Mill.  \n\nThis card looks beautiful.  There is very minor corner wear and light edge wear.  One tiny stain along the top border on the reverse.  There is a wrinkle that goes from the bottom of the card to the \"O\" in the word ASSORTMENT.  You can really only see it when you hold it at a certain angle.  I didn't even notice it when I bought it.\n\nPrice is $90.00 including US shipping.  Please PM or email me if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/WillisT2061.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/WillisT2062.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/WillisT2063.jpg[/IMG]",
