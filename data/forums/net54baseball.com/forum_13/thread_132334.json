      "post_content": "(Reduced) 1910 -11 T3 Turkey Red Ty Cobb\n\nOne of the most sought after and attractive Cobb cards, this classic rarely becomes available in an affordable grade.\n\nThe authentic grade is down to the 2 filled pin holes that can be reversed if the next owner desires to achieve a numerical grade. The size, edges, corners and color are all original and have not been tampered with. The minor rubbing on the front is less prevalent in reality than the scans show.\n\n$1680 reduced from $1790 delivered (paypal)",
