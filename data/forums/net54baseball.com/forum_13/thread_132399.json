      "post_content": "Hello, friends.  I would like to sell the following Hal Chase Blue Portrait.  It has been graded a 10 by the nice folks in Parsippany.  It has a small tear near Hal's left ear (right side as you look at the card).  As you can see, it has outstanding eye appeal. The tear is slightly more noticeable on the back.  I am asking SOLD shipped.  PP Payment Owed/Gift please.  Thank you very much for looking.\n\nAndy",
