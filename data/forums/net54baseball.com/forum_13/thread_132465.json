Let me know if you have any.  trying to keep condition in the VG-EX range, but will obviously drop down lower for hard to find backs.\n\nI have the Piedmont 350, Cycle 350 and Sovereign backs.  Looking for the rest.\n\nThanks,\n\nJason",

Hey...if you're gonna collect all the back you might as well grab the front variation as well :)\n\nBest,\nS",
