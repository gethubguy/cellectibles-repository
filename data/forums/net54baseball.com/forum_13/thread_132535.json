      "post_content": "Morning Folks,\n\n   Once again I have decided to pursue a T206 'back' collection.  Since I have a T213-2 and T215 of Joe Kelley, I figure I'll add some T206s to that mix.  I want to try and knock off some of the mid-difficult backs first.\n\nDoes anyone have a low-mid grade T206 Kelley for sale with any of the following backs?\n\nAmerican Beauty\nEl Principe De Gales\nTolstoi\nOld Mill\n\nIf so, please email me at [url]richard@richardarmstrong.ca[/url] with front/back scans and your price.\n\nThanks!\n\nRichard.",
