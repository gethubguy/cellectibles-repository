I havent started a new set in a while...(haven't finished one either:rolleyes: )\n\nLooking for mid to low grades...I'd be willing to pay a bit more for SGC graded ones, but raw or psa would work too...just about any card will do. Small lots even better!\n\nGee Richard, I kinda knew this would happen:o",

Just challenging enough to keep it interesting, and priced just reasonably enough to keep it affordable.  Of course there are some exceptions...Without a little luck, you'll have to pay aggressively for any player from Baltimore, as well as Gandil, Taylor and possibly Kelley.\n\nI still have my Toronto sub-set [13 cards].  Once I upgrade a couple, I am thinking about making a wall-hung display for them.\n\nGood luck with the set!\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.",
