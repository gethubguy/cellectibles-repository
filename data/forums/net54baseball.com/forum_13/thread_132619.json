      "post_content": "Looking to trade these for any T205s or T206s that catch my eye, Pirates or Cubs a preference but really a bunch others. I will take graded or raw preferably Good-VGEX.  Will consider any T206 HOFers or T205 Minor leaguers and have some paypal too. Shoot me some trade bait if you are interested in these. The Bender is narrower than a few of my T206s so I'm pretty sure it's trimmed....The back of the Bender is Piedmont and it has some faint paper loss from scrapboook removal and the Doyle back is almost completelety taken off with a tiny corner remaining revealing a Piedmont...\n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/BenderDoyle.jpg[/IMG][/url]",
