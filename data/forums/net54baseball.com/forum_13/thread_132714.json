      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI have an extra Eddie Collins to sell today.  It was formerly a PSA 2 that I cracked out for the raw stack, flip included.  The card is crease free, but has the the little dark spot above his hair tha matches up to a light scratch on back.  I am not sure if it was a baccer stem or what.\n\n    SOLD TO TIM, Thanks\n\nThanks,\nBob\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206collinssalefront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206collinssalefront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206collinssaleback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206collinssaleback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
