      "post_content": "Hello all,\n****Revised for break up and individual pricing****\nI am trying to stack some money to see if I can find a Drum HOFer, as the empty spot in the basic backs line bothers me everytime I look.  No regrets on breaking up the big line of HOF backs, but sure wish I had at least kept the basic line intact.\n\nI am now pricing the two remaining as individual cards\n\nPSA 4 Hands At Thighs EPDG back $425\nPSA 4 Follow Through American Beauty 460 back $400\n\nPSA 3 Portrait Cycle 350 back  SOLDD\n\nI would also consider trades for an American Beauty Eddie Collins, or beater HOFers with tougher backs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHope all is well,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206Marquardlotfront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206Marquardlotfront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/?action=view&current=T206Marquardlotback.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/FOR%20SALE/T206Marquardlotback.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
