      "post_content": "I am brokering these for a friend. Sorry the scans aren't dead on, but you'll get an idea. Both cards are clean, with great focus and a bit of wear on the corners, but not much. Backs are tight...real nice with no paper loss and minimal toning...Shag Piedmont, Ryan, Old Mill..\n\nThere are two small indentions at the bottom left of the shag about the size of the point of a pin, neither come close to going through and are not at all intrusive, only evident on close inspection. Corners are solid ex, no stains. \n\nRyan has a little more corner wear. No stains, solid VG-EX\n\nNeither have been slabbed, but both are good, not a chance of tinkering I wouldn't think. The shag especially would be a good candidate. \n\n[IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/shagrayn.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI am close to the former owner and the proposed buyer. I can read the priceguides and google, but would appreciate a few objective ideas...looking for what would be a good but not great retail price. Something you would find with shopping...but not too lowball. Thanks. Promise to keep these type questions to a minimum.",
