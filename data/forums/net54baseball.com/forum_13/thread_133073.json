Looking to break even, but feel free to make a reasonable offer with the emphasis on reasonable; I'd rather hold them than sell at a loss.\n\nBacks are good, but if you need a scan, PM me.\n\nMatty white cap PSA 3 $396  SOLD\nMatty port SGC 40 $365  SOLD\nBrown port PSA 5 $375  SOLD\nMcGraw cap PSA 4 $195\nMcGraw hip PSA 2 Tolstoi $82  SOLD\n\nShipping included, but add 3% for Paypal\n\nThanks, Jim",
