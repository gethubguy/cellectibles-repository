I must admit I know very little about most of these sets and prices will vary based on condition etc ...\n\nT206 set (minus big 6, with all the back brands and color variations) - $100 each x 500 = $50,000\nT207 set (minus 5) - $100 x 195 = $19,500\nT209-1 complete set - $300 x 16 = $4,800\nM116 near set (261 different) - $100 x 261 = $26,100\nD322 set (minus dreyfuss) - $500 x 24 = $12,000\nD304 set (set of 30 with all the \"traded\" cards and all 5 backs) - $750 x 30 = $22,500\nE90-2 complete set - $500 x 11 = $5,500\nE90-3 complete set - $500 x 20 = $10,000\nE95 complete set - $200 x 25 = $5,000\nE96 complete set - $300 x 30 = $9,000\n\nSo ballpark of $164k  GOOD LAWD!\n(I'm not trying to alter anyone's asking price, as I know nothing about the conditions of the cards or their market values.  Simply trying take a stab in the dark.  Best of luck with the sale, Robert!!!)\n\nRob\n:)",
