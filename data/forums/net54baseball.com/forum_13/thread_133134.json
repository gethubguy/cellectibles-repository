Backs are not important as long as the names and fronts are readable.  She was happy with the last buy as I am sure she will be again.  Thanks guys for any help.\n\nEmail pics and prices to [url]pup6913@hotmail.com[/url]",

I will post pics when I get to see her next time and she gets the cards.  I am sure she will be very pleased.   If you have contacted me and we have not closed a deal I am still interested in completing them.   Until next time thank you from the bottom of my heart for the great cards guys.",
