      "post_content": "I'm not giving up on my T205 collection, but for now I am going to subordinate it to my primary goal, the Monster.\n\nSo, I count 51 T205's [list and scans below] that I'm offering to trade for T206's, preferably ungraded, in basically the same condition.   \n\nI have about 250 T206's, so I need too many to list.  Let me know what you have available if you want to trade.  Ideally, we'd be trading at least several cards, not to waste too much time and expense on postage.\n\nMost of my T205's are ungraded and range from fair to good, some better, some worse; we can discuss condition when we get down to specific cards.  You might also note when viewing the scans that the cards are under 2 layers of plastic, the plastic page holder and soft sleeves which I've cut in half to make it easier to move them without damaging them--this explains the line that you see near the right-hand borders of the cards.  \n\nI've included the maximum 5 scans.  Contact me at [url]djdoremus@msn.com[/url] and I'll be glad to show you any others/the backs of the cards:\n\nSGC 30/2 John Lobert, American Beauty\nSGC 20/1.5 Richard Egan, HLC\n\nAmerican League, by team:\n \nPhiladelphia:\n   Lord, Piedmont [P]\n   Murphy, Hassan [H]\n   Murphy, P, paper loss on back \n   Hartsel, P\n   Oldring, Honest Long Cut [HLC]\n   Thomas, Sweet Caporal [SC]\n   Dygert, P\n   Bender, PB, H-o-F, poor, very creased--in beautifully beat condition.\n \nChicago:\n   Scott, Sovereign [S]\n   Parent, Polar Bear [PB]\n   McConnell, H\n   Lord, SC, scrapbook back\n   Olmstead, HLC\n   McIntyre, SC\n \nCleveland: Neal Ball, P, paper loss on back\n \nWashington: \n   Gray, SC, paper loss on back\n   Schaefer, HLC\n   Street, PB\n \nSt. Louis:\n   Pelty, P\n   Pelty, P, short/trimmed\n   Stone, HLC\n \nDetroit:\n   Moriarity, S, scribbled on back\n   Schmidt, SC\n   Tom Jones, H\n   Willet, HLC\n \nNational League:\n \nPhiladelphia:\n   Doolan, PB\n   Ewing, SC\n   Dooin, H\n \nPittsburg:\n   Camnitz, PB \n   Leach, SC\n   Phillippe, P\n \nBoston:\n   Shean, SC, paper loss on back\n   Shean, P, trimmed on top\n   Beck, PB\n   Mattern, P\n   Herzog, P\n \nNew York:\n   Meyers, P\n   Meyers, PB\n   Merkle, P\n   Crandall, P\n   Becker, SC\n   Snodgrass, P \n \nChicago:\n   Schulte, PB \n   McIntire, H\n   Pfiester, S\n   Reulbach, PB\n   Tinker, PB, H-o-F, poor, very creased and stained\n \nCincinnati: McLean, SC\n \nSt. Louis:\n   Phelps, P\n   Konetchy, P\n   Konetchy, H\n   Hauser, PB\n   Oakes, PB\n   Lush, PB\n \nBrooklyn:\n   Barger, P, short/trimmed \n   Bergen, P, trimmed\n   Lennox, PB, short/trimmed\n   Barger, P, paper loss and stamp on back \n   Bergen, SC, paper loss and stamp on back",
