      "post_content": "If you are looking for a T3 type card that is also a rarity, here is a nice one.  The pinhole will always keep it a PSA-1, but nevermind.  I have owned many Rhoades T3s, including many PSA-5 examples and this one actually displays as good or better than any of them.  The focus and clarity are sharp and the colors are clean.  A great T3.  Asking $600 OBO.\n\nIf you are putting together a T3 set, I have several nice cards available, please inquire.\n\nThanks,\nCraig",
