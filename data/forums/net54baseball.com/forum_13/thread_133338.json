      "post_content": "I find myself in a position where I need to fund the purchase of a house in the next several months. This is not going to be a fire sale of my collection, but if you\u2019ve been wanting to get a special card or have had your eye on a particular card in my collection and are willing to pay the price, we\u2019ll be able to do business. I\u2019m fielding legitimate offers on any card in my collection by email until midnight March 31st. If I\u2019m happy with your offer I\u2019ll email you letting you know we can talk turkey....if I\u2019m not (although I\u2019ll acknowledge all offers with a thank you, appreciated email response), you won\u2019t hear anything after March 31st. This won\u2019t be an auction with questions as to what the current high offer is on a particular card, all I want from anyone who has a serious interest in a card is an email stating which card they\u2019re interested in and what their top offer is on the card. Take your time, give careful thought and put your best foot forward once. I\u2019d like to get enough money together for a nice sized down payment by selling 5-10 bigger money cards and keeping the rest. I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions about a card\u2019s condition and all sales proceeds will go towards the purchase of a house for Keith. Thanks in advance, here is a link to the cards being offered...\n \nIf you see a card you can\u2019t do without, now is a good time to try prying it out of me.\n \n[url]http://s45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/56%20card%20baseball%20collection/[/url]\n \nKeith [url]Snoopy525@Embarqmail.com[/url]",
