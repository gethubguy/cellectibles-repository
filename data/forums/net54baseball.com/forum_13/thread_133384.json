      "post_content": "Raw Red Cobb portrait for sale from my collection.  As with the other cards I have moved on BST, I guarantee this one will grade.  Nicely centered, no white spots in brilliant red background.  No creases, no wrinkles, no chipping, no back damage.  Faint pink and yellow horizontal line at top of back if from my scanner and is not on card.  \n\nEmail me at: [url]eangyal@roadrunner.com[/url] with any questions or to reserve card.  Emails to me take precedence over responses in this thread.  Paypal preferred.  Willing to make price contingent upon grade realized if purchaser wants to send in to PSA or SGC.  Many references available upon request.\n\nEric",

Also, if you are interested in the Matty, dont be afraid that its raw.  If you purchase it, you can send it to SGC or PSA and if it doesnt grade at least a PSA 5 or a SGC 60, you can return the card to me and Ill refund your money, including the grading fees so long as you return the graded card to me in the condition that you originally recieved it in.  Hope this helps anyone who is apprehensive about buying the card as I am confident it is that nice.  Thanks in advanced.\n\nEric",
