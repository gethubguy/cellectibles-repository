I thought, \"Ya know, it would be pretty cool to own 1 baseball card of Tinker, Evers, and Chance (I was reminded of the poem when writing an essay on the beauty of baseball, and why the public is sensitive to it.). Well, that one thought has turned into this. I have picked up around 110 T206 cards, with the majority of them being Cubs. \n\nHey, if you are interested, I have about 75 Cubs T206 cards (duplicates of many). Let me know what condition you are looking for, and in most cases I might be able to oblige your interest. The only ones I do not have are the aforementioned Tinker Bat-off and Evers-Cubs shirt. \n\nMy e-mail is [url]npa589@yahoo.com[/url] if you have specific cards you are looking for.",
