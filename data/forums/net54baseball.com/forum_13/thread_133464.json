Theory goes, it was corner card on the sheet and oversized cards were fairly regular with the position on the sheet.  My card measures 2 3/4\" x 4 7/8\" and my short-sided borders appear a tad thicker than this card.  Id post a scan, but the scanner is down at the moment.  Id guess Tyler is correct with the trim.  Nice card and if I werent after these CJs, Id probably take you up on it.",
