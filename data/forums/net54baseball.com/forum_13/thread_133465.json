      "post_content": "A few really nice \"tougher\" EPDG's for sale.\nBacks are clean and bright.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm With Bat Brooklyn SGC30 EPDG SOLD\nPresents much nicer; has horizontal wrinkle cap heighth barely visible\nColor and image clarity and centering are \"lights out\" gorgeous.\nCould easily be a 60 without the wrinkle.\nOne of my favorite T-206 images.\n\nJohnny Kling Portrait Cubs SGC40 EPDG SOLD\nDeep rich ruby red backround, outstanding image and centering. Very small corner crease upper right. Crystal image clarity makes image depth look almost 3-D!\n\nChief Meyers Fielding NY Natl. SGC 40 EPDG SOLD\nNice emerald green backround and clear concise image. Light horizontal crease upper center left. Tough EPDG Fielding pose.\n\nJohn Titus Portrait Philadelphia Ntl. SGC30 EPDG SOLD\nOnly mustachioed ballplayer in the T-206 set, Titus cards are in high demand and demand a premium as such. The EPDG is next to impossible to find!\nBeatifully centered example has one light horizontal crease across the Titus shoulder line which doesn't detract from the sterling quality of this image.\n\nRay Demmitt NY Americans PSA4 EPDG SOLD\nCentered example with no creasing this solid PSA 4 is in demand as an EPDG Back. Nice coloration and strong image.\n \nMy scanner is old. These cards are much brighter in person!!\n \nCheck or Money Order only please.\nFirst I'll take it on these..\nRayB",
