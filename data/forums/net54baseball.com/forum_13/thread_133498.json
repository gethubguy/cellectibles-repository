That means that I have a few doubles and I would like to move them out to work on my next set(back to the monster for the 3rd time).  I have for sale or trade 2 T205 Mathewson cycle backs. I would like to keep one and sell the other it just depends on the offers presented as to which one will stay with my collection.  Asking $2300 for the 10 and $4800 for the 30 but open to trades.
