At first, I was planning on keeping this card, but have found something else I want instead...Very nice card with two pinholes and it has the Ad back with I haven't seen as often as the other back...While this card is by no means rare, it isn't seen that often...Email with any questions...\n\nPrice is $300.00\n\nTravis\n[url]tlwise12@aol.com[/url]",
