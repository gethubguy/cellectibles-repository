On front and on back!\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=33774&d=1298680007[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=33775&d=1298680022[/IMG]\n\nI used to collect signed T206 cards until about three years ago. I consigned 7 to Robert Edwards Auction for their May 2008 Auction. Lot 790 to be exact. This is my last one. Unfortunately, I have to sell it.\n\nAsking $700. Both signatures guaranteed to pass JSA. I don't think there are too many tobacco cards signed on both sides!\n\nEditted to add: Just saw that I have 2 posts... I used to be a somewhat regular poster on the old board. A wife and kids have caught up with me! I sold over 250 T206 cards two years ago on the old board as well.\n\nThanks,\nRay Piskadlo\n[url]rpiskadlo@hotmail.com[/url]",

The outfield of Jones, Cobb, Crawford is generally acknowleged as the best of the time. The Jones part of Glory of their Times is terrific...I need to revisit that book. Thanks again for sharing.",
