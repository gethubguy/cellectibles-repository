These are for my [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206;jsessionid=dwdebnln51.tiger_s\"]Lajoie collection[/URL], so I have no plans to flip these on the B/S/T or eBay three months after getting them. Am happy to purchase or trade in your favor. I've got a lot of prewar Hall of Famers and uncommon type cards -- in nice shape -- to trade. Hope to hear from you.\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\nwolfie51sb at aol.com\n\nBATTING\n\nBlack Lenox\n\nPiedmont 350-460 Factory 42\n\nSweet Cap. 350 Fact. 25 (might or might not exist; figured I'd list it)\n\nTHROWING\n\nHindu\n\nOld Mill\n\nSovereign 350\n\nSweet Caporal 350 Factory 25 (might or might not exist; figured I'd list it)\n\nPORTRAIT\n\nOld Mill\n\nSweet Caporal 150 Factory 25\n\nSweet Caporal 350 Factory 25",
