      "post_content": "March 2, 2011. I'm going to close this sale offering as I will be going out of town early next week and don't have time to devote to the sale. All cards purchased were shipped Monday so you should be receiving them soon. Thank you all for your purchases. Steve\n\nA few days ago my response to a post on the BST that was asking for SGC 40 T206 cards brought many inquiries regarding the cards I listed as well as others on my PhotoBucket site. Because of the interest shown I have decided to post a few for sale.\n\nHere is a complete listing of what I have available for sale. If a card appearing on my PhotoBucket site is not listed it is not available. Prices include shipping and I will accept checks or money orders but for paypal, if you can't do by gift, I will split the paypal cost of 3%.\n\nPayment must be received no later than Saturday, March 5, 2011 so that I can ship by Monday. Cards ordered and not paid for by Saturday will have to wait until March 21 to be shipped as I will be away. Payment by paypal or money order ships the next day. Personal checks may, in my sole discretion, have to await clearance before card is shipped.\n \nAll responses to this offering must be by email to [url]jacklitsch@comcast.net[/url] and not by private message on Net54 nor by posts to this thread. Emails have first and only preference and in the order received. An unequivocal \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d gets it. Anything short of that and the card is still available.\n  \nThe SGC A's are for the most part NM in appearance but have slight trimming. Front and back scans of all of the cards can be seen at:\n \n[url]http://s52.photobucket.com/albums/g5/jacklitsch1/T206%20Graded/[/url]\n \nBarbeau Piedmont 350 SGC A 27.50\nBatch Piedmont 350 SGC 40 42.50\nBradley Portrait Piedmont 150 SGC A 27.50 ***SOLD***\nBrashear Piedmont 350 SGC 60 75.00\nBrenahan w/bat Piedmont 350 SGC 60 275.00\nBrown, G.
