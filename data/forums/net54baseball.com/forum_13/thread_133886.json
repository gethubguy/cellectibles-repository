One has a SC 150 back, the other a Piedmont 150 back - both have clean backs.  Price is $75 delivered or willing to trade for T's or E's that I do not have.  If your trade bait is worth more than the Murphy, I can make up the difference with cash or other cards.  Willing to listen to any offers.\n\nThe card has been sold.  Thanks, John.\n\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/For%20Sale/T206MurphyThrowing.jpg[/IMG]",
