If you do some hunting there are good buys on ebay via BIN. \n\nAlso, when you say \"good deal\" are you referring to something vastly underpriced that you can then relist on ebay and double your money? If that is what you are looking for then you will not find those unless you are johnny-on-the-spot when they first get listed. However, if one is a collector and is searching for a card they need there are many sellers on ebay with reasonable prices. Personally, I sell a bit on ebay and don't feel like I am trying to gouge anyone as I set what I feel is a fair price and actually sell quite a bit through ebay, my stuff isn't graded so it is tough for the less knowledgable collector to research as they can't rely 100% on VCP to tell them if it is a \"good deal\" or not.",
