      "post_content": "**LOT HAS BEEN SOLD**  Thanks to all who were interested.\n\nHello.  I have the following 20 card T206 lot available for sale.  As you can see in the scans, this is a low grade lot and most of these cards have significant condition issues such as paper loss/damage, trimming, heavy creasing, etc.  As I'm sure you've noticed, the prices on even very low grade T206's and especially lots have been steadily climbing lately.  \n\nI'm asking $275 delivered for this lot.  I accept payment via any method you prefer.  If I don't have any takers on the entire lot after a day or two, I will price the cards individually.  Cards included are as follows:\n\nBeck\nBescher\nCLARKE (HOF, Sovereign back)\nDavis\nDevlin\nDonovan\nDoolin\nGANDIL\nHofman\nF. Jones\nKillian\nKnight\nMerritt\nH. Moran\nO'Neil\nSchmidt\nSeymour\nTurner\nUnglaub\nD. White\n\nThanks for looking and please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions.",
