      "post_content": "Hi everyone. I picked these cards up separately about ten years ago and now want to sell or trade for T206. Prefer trades to sell. Willing to trade or sell individually or as a group. \n\nThe Cards I have available are pictured. \n\nGregg Broadleaf- No Creases, Sharp Corners. Clean and Crisp Back. Not great centering but a good image and highly presentable. Overall very clean. Broadleaf Fact 25 2nd VA.\n \nTRADEDFisherTRADED\n\nMiller SCD VG/EX 4. Nice, Solid looking card. \nSubgrades of 6 Surface, 6 Corners/Edges , 2 Centering.\n\n\nPlease see scans. Private me here for quickest response. To give you an idea of what I am looking for I am working on T206 commons in PSA5 and would love to find a rare backed card to counter the loss of the Broadleaf.\n\nThanks for reading my post and I hope you like my offering. I am somewhat new here but can provide references (as a buyer) and will work with people towards a satisfactory outcome.\n\nSome higher detail scans of the ungraded cards can be seen by clicking this link-\n\n[url]http://s1209.photobucket.com/albums/cc398/botport/Cards%20For%20Sale/[/url]",
