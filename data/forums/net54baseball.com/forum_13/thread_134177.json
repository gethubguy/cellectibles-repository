I just listed a lot on the B/S/T a few days ago that included a few low grade cards.  I'm willing to sell them individually.  I have about 100 other T205's, mostly a bit nicer mid-grade but a few low grade ones.  I'd be glad to send you my full list if you'd like.  Feel free to send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] if you're interested.",
