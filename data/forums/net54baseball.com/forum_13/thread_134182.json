I wanted to add one of the tough cards immediately and purchased this one.  I have since committed my time and effort to the T205 set, and have traded or sold all but two of my T206.  This is one of them.  I would like to trade it for a \nT205 Cobb of comperable price (appx. $1000).  It's obviously creased, and marked front and back, but it is intact, no missing pieces, etc.  Please email [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url] with scans of what you'd like to trade.  \n\nThis is the first time I have attempted to add photos to one of my posts, so if the card does not appear, I will gladly email you front and back scans of the cards once you email me. \n\nThanks for looking.",
