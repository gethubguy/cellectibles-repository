      "post_content": "I have a few T49s for sale, pretty tough set from schultes \"own\" brand. The set is generic college scenes with a few sports themed ones. The 3 shown here are baseball and football, the others will be over on the non-sports side soon.  \nAll are hand cut. The original find I had in late 2009 and some bought recently, probably from the same source. About 30-35 altogether, all hand cut.   \nFirst one - Yale Football. One bad corner, and a crease at the upper right. \nThis is one of the tougher cards, It wasn't checklisted till I found one in the first batch [url]http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~dan/T49/go.html[/url] This is a second one. $125\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3245[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3246[/IMG]\n\nSecond one Bowdoin Baseball. Also hand cut, but full borders. light creasing at the upper left corner. Small scuff near the college seal  $150\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3249[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3248[/IMG]\n\nThird one, also Bowdoin. Smaller borders, and the surface is slightly dirty/dusty. No creases $150\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3247[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=123&pictureid=3250[/IMG]\n\nMost forms of payment are ok, prices include priority mail. I can do registered at cost if you want. \nI would also consider trades.\nI'll do either Emails or PMs in the order they come in (I'm not expecting any big rush, but just in case...) \n\nSteve B",
