      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI am selling off a bunch of my T206 cards. I want to sell them in groups and not individually. So I am splitting them up in grades for the sale. I will prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order (No PayPal). I will accept a check, but I will hold the cards until the check clears. If you pay with a US Postal money order, I will ship the cards on the same day that I receive the payment.\n\nYou can view all of the cards on my web-site. \nThe link is: [url]http://www.cyscards.com/t206.htm[/url]\n\n(Don't ask about the PSA 5 cards. They're all sold.)\n\nYou can contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nHere is the breakdown with prices:\n\nSix SGC 60 Cards - Price $550 delivered\n    4 Bill Abstein                  Pit             \n  108 Gavvy Cravath           Minn            \n  126 Bill Dineen(Dinneen)     StL(A)          \n  179 John Ganzel               Rochester       \n  253 Jack Knight(Portrait)    NY (A)          \n  467 Lee Tannehill(Tann)     Chi(A)        \n\nSGC 50 Lot SOLD Eight SGC 50 Cards - Price $390 delivered\n    4 Bill Abstein                 Pit            \n  176 Art Fromme               Cin            \n  258 Harry Krause(Portrait) Phi(A)           \n  454 Jim Stephens            StL(A)         \n  435 Jimmy Slagle             Balt           \n  465 Jesse Tannehill          Wash             \n  472 Ira Thomas               Phi(A)           \n  499 Ed Willett                 Det            \n\nSGC 40 Lot SOLD Fifteen SGC 40 Cards - Price $510 delivered\n   11 Frank Arellanes           Bos(A)           \n   61 Fred Burchell              Buffalo        \n   63 Bill Burns                   Chi(A)           \n  141 Tom Downey(Fielding) Cin              \n  144 Larry Doyle(Portrait)   NY (N)          \n  150 Joe Dunn                  Brkln            \n  176 Art Fromme              Cin            \n  222 George Hunter           Brkln           \n  224 Fred Jacklitsch          Phi(N)          \n  271 Jimmy Lavender         Prov             \n  302 John McAleese           StL(A)         \n  305 Moose McCormick       NY (A)          \n  306 Pryor McElveen          Brkln           \n  354 Peter O'Brien            StPaul         \n  480 Bob Unglaub             Wash             \n\n\nSGC 30 Lot SOLD Fifteen SGC 30 Cards - Price $400 delivered\n   66 Bobby Byrne               StL(N)      \n  158 Clyde Engle                NY (A)      \n  234 Tom Jones                 StL(A)      \n  246 Ed Killian(Portrait)       Det         \n  266 Joe Lake(Ball Hand)     StL(A)      \n  276 Ed Lennox                 Brkln       \n  335 George Moriarty          Det         \n  341 Danny Murphy(Batting)Phi(A)      \n  344 Red Murray(Portrait)    NY (N)      \n  349 Simon Nicholls(Knees)  Phi(A)      \n  349 Simon Nicholls(Knees)  Phi(A)      \n  422 Jim Scott                  Chi(A)      \n  458 Sam Strang                Balt        \n  459 Gabby Street(Catching)Wash        \n  505 Owen Wilson               Pit         \n\nThank you.\n\nCy",
