      "post_content": "Offering a nice t206 Brown Portrait graded PSA 2. It has NO creases and a nice clean front with great eye appeal. The back has a glue stain. All the glue has apparently been removed-its just a stain. Great looking card for the price. Price includes shipping, insurance. I see my dog has included a hair in the scan around Brown's left ear-its not a scratch on the card. Feel free to e-mail me at [url]javanbrigham@verizon.net[/url]\n\n$90 paypal gift or personal check\nAdd 3% for regular paypal",
