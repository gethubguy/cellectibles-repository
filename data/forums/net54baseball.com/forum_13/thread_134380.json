He was working on a Aaron RC and was using the funds for the purchase. Then his deal supposedly fell through and I got an email the next day. \"Iam not selling you the card . What I dont get it what does his deal have to do with my purchase , he still gains the 2k I agreed to purchase for and looks for another Aaron or doesnt...So that's the way it goes.:confused:\n\nOh well Joes vintage and Phillis plan (Doug) have me 2 decent bat off's to be proud of .GOnna get the Cobbs back going again and to be the main focus . Guess this Red wasnt meant to be :(",

I had 44 Red Cobbs at once together and many other Cobbs overall. He used his rights and I used mine.\n\nHe still could have said dont sell your cards just yet to fund this.\n\n I still can replace all 4 portraits I sold that eve. I wasnt going to ask my guy for them back. That did change hands. But that big bordered Bender will take awhile to find back.:eek:",
