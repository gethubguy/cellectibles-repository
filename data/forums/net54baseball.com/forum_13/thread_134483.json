      "post_content": "I've realized that collecting T cards is just too darn expensive for me! I really enjoy 50's-60's cards so I've gotten rid of all (but one) of the graded T cards I own. However, I'd like an example of the most popular ones, just to have. What I'm looking for is this:\n\n1 T206 card portrait\n1 T206 card non-portrait\n1 T205 card Nat'l League\n1 T205 card Amer League\n1 T205 card Minor League\n\nI want all commons and I'm not picky about condition but would rather have cards that would grade a 2 or so (raw only). I just want cards that present fairly well. I want to buy all of this from one person, as one lot. Please PM me what you've got and your price. Thanks.",
