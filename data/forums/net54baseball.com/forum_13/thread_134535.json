Some have a back stamp, which is likely not significant.\n\nAll I can guarantee, these are authentic and look terrific. sorry. \n\nIve got big mutha images, but you may have to wait. We got David taming Goliath, alone over here and she Still wants me to vacuum!\n\nEntire lot only... Make an email offer. Tanx, Steve \n\n[url]fdnyladder7@comcast.net[/url]",
