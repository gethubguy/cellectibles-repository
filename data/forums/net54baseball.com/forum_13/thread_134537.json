I have come across a couple in this pile, that were absolutely scissored, as well as written upon eons ago -though doubtful maliciously. \n\nTherefore, I can't guarantee they havent been trimmed, altered, bleached, recolored etc etc, sorry. \n\nIve got big mutha images, but you may have to wait for a reply. \n\nEntire lot only... Make an email offer. Tanx, Steve \n\n[url]fdnyladder7@comcast.net[/url]",
