Small crease in bottom left corner, does not go thru the back,  back has a small mark on the letter \"d\" of piedmont with some slight staining around that area. there is also a fading between the letters \"l\" and \"i\" in the word quality, but it does not appear to be paper loss.  Back is piedmont 350-460, beautiful color and sharp focus. The card is a great value at the price, detailed scans available, just send me your email address. First $625 gets it!! Thanks, pay pal gift at this price. PRICE IS ACTUALLY $585!! THANKS  **SOLD**",
