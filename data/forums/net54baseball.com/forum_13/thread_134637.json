      "post_content": "Absolutely perfectly centered with sweet cap 350 back. Corners are as follows, upper left and bottom right close to nm, upper left and lower right exmt. Corners that are exmt still square up and come to a point, they just have minor touches.  Back is spotless, no stains or any issues, period. Incredible color and focus. If you are looking for a premium cy young portrait, this is for you. First $2500 gets it. Would consider trade for high grade t206s.  Detailed scans available, just send me your email. Thanks  CARD AVAILABLE",
