Some minors and hofs tossed in. No bad surprises here.\n\nIncidentally, these next two or three lots are the highest quality of The Find. Many VG-EX and only a few (>1%) have been EX, IMO. Im dumping the 3-4s first. So offer as if 3s, even 2's. I don't want to see em ever again. Of course, authenticity is guaranteed. \n\nEmails only, Im not snubbing you guys., Just that the Droid doesn't like the internal PM thingy here. Gracie, Steve F [url]fdnyladder7@comcast.net[/url]",
