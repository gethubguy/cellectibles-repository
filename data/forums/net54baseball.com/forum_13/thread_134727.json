      "post_content": "I'm looking to buy some tobacco cards, mainly t205 and t206, but others are ok also, to build up inventory for an upcoming card show.\n\nCards can be in any condition, commons, semi-stars, stars, HOFers, hi-numbers anything and everything. Graded or raw. I am looking to resell these cards at card shows here in town so please keep that in mind when discussing pricing.\n\nPrefer bulk lots, but singles are ok too. Please PM me or email me at [url]nt_vintagecards@hotmail.com[/url] with stuff you have to sell. Payment can be sent via paypal, check, or MO, whatever you prefer.",
