      "post_content": "Thanks Erick\n\n\nPiedmont, Pardon the lousy shot. These are clean and bright. Email no PMs please. \n\nMessed up my addition. 117 cards. Exactly what u see in scan. \n\nNo returns on these, so make a suitable offer.  \n\n[url]fdnyladder7@comcast.net[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/oche16/The%20Jane%20Collection/127ctT206whofsmarch26-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nDue to the fact that an N54 member was unhappy with the varying sizes of the T206's in his large lot; These lots are only guaranteed AUTHENTIC. Thus, make an offer with that in mind. I don't want sh!t coming back, just going out. Pardon the inconvenience.",
