If you'd like to raise some funds and have any of the cards below, you and I likely will be able to reach a quick and easy deal. I'm not fanatical about condition, and I don't really care whether a card is graded (I guess that makes me a real collector!).\n\nPlease let me know what you have. E-mail, PM or a reply to this post is fine. See? It's already easy.\n\nT206 Lajoies\n\nWITH BAT\n\nLenox\n\nPiedmont 350-460 Factory 42\n\nTHROWING\n\nBrown Hindu\n\nOld Mill\n\nSovereign 350\n\nPORTRAIT\n\nOld Mill\n\nSweet Caporal 150 Factory 25\n\nE94 Lajoie\n\nOlive and green\n\nLajoie Sweet Caporal Domino Disks\n\nAny I don't have [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/ineedanap/othertobaccoissues\"]on this page[/URL] \n\nAny other Lajoie cards, postcards or pins that picture him with Cleveland and [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/ineedanap/\"]aren't found here[/URL].\n\nThanks,\n\nRob",
