      "post_content": "I purchased this lot solely for the Cobb (bat on).  I am taking offers, email only (ppgustafson@yahoo.com) on the remainder of the group (NO Cobb).  I will state the condition as Steve did \"F-G\" and accept offers as such.  However, the average condition is GD to VG, some slightly better and a very small number less (one beantown back stamp).  The group is being sold on the same terms as Steve's: \"authenticity only\" guaranteed and no returns, complaints.  The group is solid.  I have put each into a card saver I and they will be delivered as such.  Again, email offers only and payment to be made via check/money order - no paypal.  Steve's original pictures below.\n\nThanks\n[url]ppgustafson@yahoo.com[/url]",
