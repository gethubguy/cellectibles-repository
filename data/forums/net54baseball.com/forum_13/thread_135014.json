      "post_content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm looking to rekindle my love for the T205 and T206 sets.  Currently I only own 5 T205s and a single T206, so I need just about anything.  I would love to grab a large lot (since I've been unsuccessful at grabbing Steve's awesome offers right now) of either gradable raw cards or SGC slabbed.  I'm not completely against PSA, but I certainly would love to have SGC over it.  \n\nI'm also game for obtaining single cards as well.  I don't have a ton to trade, so I will probably need to buy....although let me know what you collect.\n\nThanks so much!!\n\nJimi\n\nPS.  Please e-mail me at [url]jimivintage@yahoo.com[/url]",
