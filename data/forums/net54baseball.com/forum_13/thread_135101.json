      "post_content": "Homemade solid oak card stands. Nice alternative to plastic. Unfinished and ready for choice of paint, stain, polyurethane. The slot is designed to hold a SGC, PSA or BCCG graded card. It's all about thickness of the holder. SGC cards stand nearly vertical w/ a slight tilt, PSA, BCCG with more tilt. \n\n10 for $30, shipped.\nIf you're not happy, return in 10 days and we'll refund your money. You pay return shipping. \nChecks, MOs & PayPal gift.",
