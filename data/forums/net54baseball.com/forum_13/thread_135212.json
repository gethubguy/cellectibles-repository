      "post_content": "The first eight are all VG/EX and were each graded SGC 50.  I did crack them out, but I saved the flips (will include with purchase).  Here is a link that shows all of them when they were graded.  Again, they are all raw at this point as I have since cracked them out.\n\n[url]http://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/T206/[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/For%20Sale/T206Lot1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAmes SC350, Atz Piedmont 350, Doyle Piedmont 350-460, Hahn Piedmont 150, Lattimore Piedmont 350, Maddox SC350, Manning Piedmont 350-460 and Perring SC350\n\n\n\n\nThese 5 vary in condition, so I will try to describe them as best as possible.\n\nBurch Polar Bear - was a PSA 4 that I cracked out.  I saved the flip, but I can't seem to find it.  If I happen to find it, I will include it with the purchase.\n\nSnodgrass Piedmont 350-460 - we'll call it GOOD with a horizontal crease at the bottom (about 1/4\" up).\n\nSheckard SC150 - we'll call it GOOD with a corner crease top left corner.  \n\nPfeister Piedmont 350 - we'll call it VG+.  No creases, only corner wear.  Could be VG/EX on a good day.  Wet sheet transfer.  \n\nKleinow Piedmont 350 - we'll call it GOOD.  Has a few minor creases.  I can't see the creases, but I can feel them.  None break the paper (no paper loss).  \n\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/For%20Sale/T206Lot2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI am only selling them as one lot at this point.  If they do not sell as one lot, I will consider selling them individually.  Price is $475 delivered.",
