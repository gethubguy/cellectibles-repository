      "post_content": "Looking for my first T206 HOF card. Would consider any portrait in excellent condition (prefer PSA 5-6). \nWanted to stay in the $250-550 price range so I guess that would include cards such as Bender, E.Collins, Griffith, Walsh, etc.\n\nReally looking forward to adding a quality card to my collection of T206 commons. Thanks.",
