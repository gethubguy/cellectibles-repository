Please let me know what you have for trade.\n\nThe card has a clean Piedmont 350 back, and in case the scan appears dull or fuzzy, please be assured that the focus and registration on this card is crisp.  It's a nice card.\n\nYou can PM me or send an email to [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url].  Thanks!",
