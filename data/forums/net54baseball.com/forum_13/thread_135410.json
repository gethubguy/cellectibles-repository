      "post_content": "I need to clear out the last of my T3s.  I am pricing these competitive with VCP taking into consideration the strong appeal on most of these.  The Mathewson is very beautiful for the technical grade and only some front wear is visible.  It is one of the strongest Mathewsons in the hobby and I purchased it several years ago from a member right here on the BST. I paid alot more that what current prices have been but appeal carries it a long way.  These prices are firm and pics can be viewed under pastime08 on ebay or I can send scans.  Prices posted are for board members ONLY and ONLY off eBay and check or MO.  I can do pay pal but you must add 3% to my price.  I am pricing several of these bleow my cost to move them.  I will ship ASAP and overnight if you spend more than $1k.  \n\nRaymond PSA 4 $400\nBell SGC 50 (strong) $700\nBender PSA 3 $600\nElberfeld psa 4 $650\nMcGraw PSA 4 $700\nJennings PSA 4 $950\nChase PSA 4 $700\nCamnitz PSA 4 $450\nSallee PSA 3 (strong) $400\nA Close Play SGC 30 (strong) $250\nBridwell PSA 5 $1100\nHofman PSA 5 $1250\nTinker PSA 4 $1000\nMcBride PSA 4 $500\nDahlen PSA 3 (mk) faint pencil somewhere $325\nNiles PSA 4 $400\nMathewson SGC 30 (STRONG-I paid $5K for this card) $3,000\n\nemail me at [url]ekekela08@aol.com[/url] or [url]dduncanvintage@aol.com[/url].
