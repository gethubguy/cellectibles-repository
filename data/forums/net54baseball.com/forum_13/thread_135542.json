      "post_content": "T206 Hughie Jennings (HOF) portrait in high grade, (Sgc80) for sale. $650 delivered, fully insured. Please drop me a pm or email if interested. Would also entertain trades towards other HOF's I need from the set. Condition of trades whether it's 1 card or multiple's would not have to match the Jennings in grade, but they cannot look like they been run over by a truck either. :) Let me know what you may have if trade is your choice and we can discuss.
