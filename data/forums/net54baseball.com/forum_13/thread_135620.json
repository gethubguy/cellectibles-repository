      "post_content": "A bunch of T206s for sale.  Dupes and such.  Most in VG or VGEX condition.  A couple have creases but most do not.  Ask for any specifics on any card interested in and I will describe in detail.\n\nSelling individually for $35 each/shipped.  If buying multiples, consider them $32 per card with $3 shipping charge added on.  I'll throw in the insurance and tracking.\n\nSee them all at this link.\n\n[url]http://s1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/Selling%20April%2012th/[/url]\n\nThe first card, the Ellam Southern Leaguer is $70 (creases and all). :)  The spot above the E in Piedmont is not on the card.  Just dirt on the scanner.\n\n\nEllam\nAbbaticchio\nAmes\nBall\nBarger\nBarry\nBeaumont\nBell\nBurchell\nDineen\nHahn\nHayden\n\nArndt - SOLD\nBrashear - SOLD\nCamnitz - SOLD\nCriger - SOLD\nDonlin - SOLD\n\n\nThanks.",
