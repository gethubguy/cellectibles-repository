      "post_content": "I purchased this lot solely for the Cobb (bat on). I am taking offers, email only (ppgustafson@yahoo.com) on the remainder of the group (NO Cobb). I will state the condition as Steve did \"F-G\" and accept offers as such. However, the average condition is GD to VG, some slightly better and a very small number less (one beantown back stamp). The group is being sold on the same terms as Steve's: \"authenticity only\" guaranteed and no returns, complaints. The group is solid. I have put each into a card saver I and they will be delivered as such. I will also pay for insured/secure/safe shipping.  \nAgain, email offers only and payment to be made via check/money order - no paypal. Steve's original pictures below.\n\nThanks\n[url]ppgustafson@yahoo.com[/url] \n\n\nHere is Steve's original post (a better image may be available by searching for Steve's original post):\n\n\"May have minor creases, surface flaws, edge wear, corner dings, stains, I couldnt find any paperloss on this batch. Appear F-G, some a bit better. Backs; commensurate. \n\nHaven't seen the light of day in generations. \n\n*Authenticity ONLY Guaranteed*\".\n\n\n[IMG]http://collectiblesauctionplace.com/Steve140.jpg[/IMG]",
