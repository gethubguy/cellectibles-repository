      "post_content": "I have a 115 card lot of dupes that Id like to sell in one shot.\nIncludes Demmitt/Stl, 16 Hof's, and 98 commons.  Lots of PB backs.\n\nI know you guys like to have a price, but Im a relative newbie at selling so Im going to let you decide what it is worth.\nSo this will be a BEST OFFER type of sale.\n\nI have a figure in mind, and if an offer reaches that figure, I will sell.  If not, I will break up and sell individually and in smaller lots.  But as of right now, this is being sold as a lot only.  \n\nEmail me only with offers.  No PM please.  \n\nI will keep all interested parties updated on where the best offer stands. \n\nPlease be patient with me as far as replies, as I work 5pm-3am (while most of you are at work, I am home and vice versa).  \n\nI will accept offers until about Tuesday or until I havent recieved a new offer for 24 hours.\n\n[url]thauswirth01@sbcglobal.net[/url]\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any and all questions (except \"will you sell \"so and so\" individually).\n\nFront and back scans can be seen at the link below.\n\n[url]http://s1103.photobucket.com/albums/g472/kllrbee69/T206%20x%20115/?start=all[/url]\n\n\nAlso, for ease of viewing link, Demmitt and Hof's are shown first, then the commons in alphabetical order.\n\nThanks Net 54 and everyone for looking!!",
