      "post_content": "I have 4 T204's for sale,\n\nJoe Dunn SGC 30 Lionel Carter card, very tough common $250\n\nGabby Street PSA A, they deemed it trimmed, but it appears to size fine and has the same centering as some other graded ones I own?? Gorgeous card $250 No guarantee that anyone else will grade it either though.\n\nJim Stephens PSA A, another deemed trimmed, yet the edges don't show it, and there is evidence of wear on the corner tips. The card is a bit undersized and they may have felt it trimmed down. At any rate very attractive card and image. $250 same caveat as above.\n\nCharles O'Leary raw F/G but the all important TTT back displays quite nicely, $300 Great for a type collector on a budget. I sold a couple with staining on the back for more than this recently, however they had nicer images.\n\nCheck or Money Order preferred.\n\nScott",
