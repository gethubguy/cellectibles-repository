      "post_content": "Beautiful, low pop card with a very rare back.all collectors have  seen recent uncommon backs in recent major auction houses ( bill goodwin, rea, etc.,)  bring crazy premiums. This card is extremely solid, only top to bottom centering keeps the card from being an sgc 84. Detailed scans available, just please send me your email. Offered at $495. Thanks",
