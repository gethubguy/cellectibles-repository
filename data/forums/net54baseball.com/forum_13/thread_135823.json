      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following 40 card T206 lot available for sale. As you can see by the scans, most of the cards are lower grade.  These are all duplicates from the recent Beantown find so this is an inexpensive way to add a piece of that to your collection.  Payment via any method you prefer. Thanks for looking and please e-mail me at [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions or to reserve cards.\n\nCards will be priced individually but I will consider offers on the entire lot.  All prices are delivered.\n\ncards remaining (removing sold cards from list for easier viewing):\n\nBarry $11\nDoolan $10\nDubuc $13\nHuggins $25\nKelley $25\nLaPorte **SOLD**\nMcQuillan **SOLD**\nOldring $15\nSchlei $12\nStovall $12\n\nOr take the last 8 for $120 delivered.",
