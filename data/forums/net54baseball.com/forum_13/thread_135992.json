      "post_content": "I'm down to the last few cards for my T206 St. Louis Nat'l set and am hoping that you fine folks can help me mark these off of my list.  I need SGC or PSA graded copies in the 3-4.5 range (I will settle for a nice 2 for the Willis).  It would also be nice to get some of these with less common backs.  I still need Tolstoi, Polar Bear, etc.  Please let me know if you have nicely centered copies of these players:\n\n*Charles\n*Rhodes\n*Shaw\n*Willis Throwing\n\nI'm also hoping someone can help me out with a realistic looking reprint of the O'Hara St. Louis version.  I will probably never be able to afford the real thing but I want a \"complete\" set.  So if someone has something like this available I would very much appreciate it.\n\nI also need all T205 Cardinals (except Huggins) in the PSA/SGC 3-4.5 range.  Please let me know what you have available.  \n\nThanks!\n\nChris",

I do have a duplicate of the Willis throwing, a nice PSA 4 with a Sweet Caporal back (sorry, no exotic backs), that I could sell for $145.  E-mail sent as well.\nThanks,\n--S\n\n[IMG]https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9XhlPZEe5CM/TPAXPCypcTI/AAAAAAAABXQ/YkN1jNrer2Q/s640/T206%252520Willis%252520HOF%252520%252528throwing%252529%252520-%252520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w-3-h8SIkS4/TPAXPRLSqgI/AAAAAAAABXY/IRG3fy_uv_4/s640/T206%252520Willis%252520HOF%252520%252528throwing%252529%252520-%252520rear.jpg[/IMG]",
