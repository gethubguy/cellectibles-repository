Yes, the BL460s are around but folks aren't selling them.....I had to pay an arm and a leg for mine a few years ago....I would expect a decent one to be in the 2.5k-3.5k area.....maybe even a bit more with Wonka having deep pockets for what he collects nowadays .....",

      "post_content": "Big Mike!\n\nLong time no see, we need another night in NYC soon huh?\n\nLeon that's Mr. Deep Pockets Wonka to you! :D\n\nI do think Leon is close a nice BL460 say PSA 2 or SGC30 could be around 3.5k-4k perhaps more as most folks just dont want get rid of them.\n\nI dont think you will find too many for 2.5k unless it's beat for the grade etc. short of the Goodwin example in 2010 and the raw one in B&L Leon did that card ever grade anyting other than raw curious?\n\nHowever I will take all the nice BL460 at 2.5k please contact me right away. \n\nIf you start get into say PSA 4 range most likely you will be between 7.5k-10+k. Anything 5 and above would be 12k+ and up IMO.\n\nThere are around 40+ examples in the hobby I'm aware of I'm sure there's another 10+ or so in old timers collections we just haven't seen come to market etc.\n\nOut of the 40 or so the breakdown is around here...\n\nEX-EXMT (6) cards only two are commons rest are big $$ HOF players and the EXMT common card is trimmed but in a PSA holder.\n\nVGEX (2) cards\n\nG-VG (12) or so cards, 2 or so of these are big $$ HOF players.\n\nThe rest of the cards are PR to trimmed or missing paper.\n\nHope this helps, Mike I know where a few are we can chat soon I'll try to help you find one if I can.\n\nCheers,\n\nJohn",
