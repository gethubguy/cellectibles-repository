Any specific questions, ask away.  I would think all would grade out in the solid 3-4 range. \n\nArndt - SOLD\nButler - SOLD\nCamnitz\nFiene\nFlanagan\nMalarkey - SOLD\nMoran\nRhoades\nThielman\nWiltse\n\n[IMG]http://i1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/SOLDSovereign.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/IMG_0001-4.jpg[/IMG]",
