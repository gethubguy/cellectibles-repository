      "post_content": "Hello.  I have the following 20 card T206 lot available for sale.  As you can see by the scans, these are about as low grade as they come.  There is a Southern Leaguer and a few less common backs.  T206 lots under $10 per card are pretty much non-existent anymore so this is a quick and inexpensive way to cross a bunch off your checklist.  Thanks for looking and feel free to send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to reserve cards or with any questions.\n\ncards pictured:\n\nTake the remaining 13 for $90 delivered.\n\nBall **SOLD**\nBerger $6\nBescher $9\nBurchell $6\nClancy $8\nEasterly $9\nFreeman $9\nHallman **SOLD**\nHart (Southern Leaguer) **SOLD**\nManning (Tolstoi) **SOLD**\nPoland (Sovereign) $9\nRitter **SOLD**\nSchirm $6\nSeymour $5\nSheckard **SOLD**\nStreet $10\nWhite (Sovereign) $5\nWilletts $5\nWilson **SOLD**\nWiltse (Sovereign) $8",
