This is what happens when those pesky oversized cards just won\u2019t fit into those sheets, his or her mistake your savings. :)\n\nCARD IS SOLD\n\nGreat way to have a \u201cMagie\u201d that doesn\u2019t look rough and fill a tough spot that lots of T206 collectors still need checked off.\n\nI will get back to you as soon as I can and try to answer all offers.\n\nCheers,\n\nJohn",

I am open to trades as well.",

And if the prospective buyers \"make offers\" isn't that really an auction with a reserve?  Just a matter of how you look at it I suppose...you are essentially having an auction with a reserve, not a card for sale.\n\nJust my mindless rambling after happy hour...nice card, it will make somebody happy!\n\nCheers,\nGeno",

      "post_content": "How about make an offer on the card or have another drink. :confused:\n\nNot really here to debate or listen to your views of selling structures.\n\nBut thanks for taking the time to chime in and comment on my method of proposed sale. \n\nGlad to hear you also feel the card is nice and could make someone happy whew! I had my concerns on selling the card to someone and bumming them out. :)\n\nBut now that we all have been given your seal of approval potential buyers should be able to offer with confidence.\n\nNext time I decide to toss something up for sale or to feel  out the waters here in the BST with my own inventory.  I\u2019ll will be sure to run it by you prior to posting forgive me I\u2019m new to this whole hobby thing.\n\nSimply put, my card listed to feel out for trade bait or cash etc.\n \nNot selling the card under any propaganda story about assisted living or linked front page shameless promoting posts that just happen to coincide with a listing to come or currently listed.\n\nNot relisting the card one hour after I won it in a very public venue for twice the price demanding a sale in 2 days hoping that folks have amnesia and didn\u2019t just see the same card hours ago sell for half.\n\nNot listing card for 400x market price and bumping each time it gets below page one or each hour.\n \nTruth is I don\u2019t necessarily need to set a price as I\u2019m not really hard up to sell the card. If you know the market you can guess what roughly they are going for and offer something if you want to own it. The final thing that crossed my mind was I really don\u2019t care about your thoughts unless you are a serious buyer and not some guy rolling out of a bar on a Friday night on his fourth Appletini with no offer other than advice. :)\n\nCheers,\n\nJohn",
