I picked this one up a while ago and recently managed to upgrade and now would like to trade this one away.\n\nHere are the particulars:  This card probably cannot be graded as the process used to slab cards would probably knock the lower part of the left border off (if not do more substantial damage to the card which is already in pretty rough shape).  It does have a green border, but I can also attest to the fact this is not a printing error or variation - just oxidation of the gold paint used for the borders and rough to the touch.  \n\nIt is authentic, it is fragile and needs a home in a collection where its new owner is building a raw, low grade set.  Email [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url] or PM me with offers.",
