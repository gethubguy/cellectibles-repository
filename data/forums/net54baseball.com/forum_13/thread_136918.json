      "post_content": "A very large grouping of the Series 7 set is available in this single offering.  On the whole, this is a pretty attractive group of cards. Very few of the cards have any sort of significant creasing or wear on them.  A few have corner chipping or a small amount of back damage.  There are no \"dogs\" in this group though and all of the cards are still quite displayable.  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nt210-7s\nBeatty (Raleigh) GD - wrinkle free, corner wear, tiny spot of damage on back --- $90\nBonner (Rocky Mount) GD - wrinkle free, corner wear, tiny bits of residue on back--- $90\nCowell (Wilson) PR/FR - creasing on front, small areas of damage on the back. --- $50\nDailey (Goldsboro) FR/GD - some corner chipping on front, no wrinkles, tiny bits of wear on reverse  --- $80\nDussault  (Rocky Mount) PR/FR - creasing on front --- $45\nEvans (Goldsboro) FR - nice VG front, one spider wrinkle, some residue and damage on back  --- $65\nFulton (Goldsboro)  FR - very nice VG front, no wrinkling, some residue and damage on back  --- $65\nGastmeyer (Rocky Mount) (bat) FR/GD - one wrinkle on front, tiny bits of residue on reverse --- $80\nGastmeyer (Rocky Mount) (field) FR - one wrinkle on front, mild residue on reverse  --- $65\nGunderson (Goldsboro) PR/FR - Tough card in set! nice VG front, no wrinkling, significant back damage --- $100\nHam (Raleigh) GD - Tough card in set!
