      "post_content": "Some more description for those that are interested:\n\nThe cards will fit mostly in the P-G range.  If you graded any card, I think the best you would do is an SGC 40, but it wouldn't be very many.  No cards are skinned, and I don't believe any of the cards are trimmed, although I didn't measure any card, so don't hold me on it.  :)  Wait, pretty sure the AB Clarke is trimmed on the sides, but if I remember correctly, the ABs are a little different on their sizes.  The Matty has been outlined in pen around his face and eyes, etc.  If it weren't for the that, the card is decently presentable although probably still no better than a 20.  The back is completely readable.  I do have a second Matty that is pretty messed up along the edges and quite bad along the bottom right corner.  I have it in my HOF collection basically only because there is no writing on it.  I would let you pick either one.  The Brown is pretty nice.  It might be the best card in the lot.  The Dahlen is ok except for a few little speckles of paperloss on the front.  Tinker looks very nice on the front, but has paperloss on the back border.  The main issue with the worse cards is either paperloss or corner issues where it almost appears that it was ripped off at some point many years ago.  Bad paperloss on front cards would be Becker, Carrigan, Graham (Rustlers), Phillipe, and Stovall.  The bad corner cards would be Chase, Hauser, Knight, Latham, Leever, Leifield, Moriarity, Murray, and Richie.  Oldring has a hole punch.  O'Leary has a bit of attempted pencil erasing of the word \"Cards\" on front.  Olmstead has a piece of red paper stuck to the front, but not too distracting. Shean (Cubs) and Street have a piece missing off the bottom and top, respectively.  The other 84 cards are more presentable than the 19 I just listed.  I hope I didn't make this lot seem terrible, as it is a nice lot.  :)",
