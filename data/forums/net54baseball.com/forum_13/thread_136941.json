[Note that this card is in a handcut plastic holder and don't be confused by the top borderline.]\n\nIf my #1 doesn't sell by noon tomorrow, I'll offer my second for $160.  This card can be reserved conditionally [If the other doesn't sell by noon tomorrow, this goes on sale then].\n\nNo pm's, please; my box is full.  You can email me at [url]djdoremus@msn.com[/url].\nIf you're reserving #2, post it officially on this thread for the sake of propriety.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug",
