I find it pretty cool. \n\nLooking for great eye appeal, great centering, no creases, blah blah blah - but don't want to spend more than what a 4 would cost. SGC, PSA, BVG - fine with me. \n\nIt can have the entire back missing, marks, doodles, can be authentic, don't care. Essentially, I just want to own both versions of the card, and I just want the fronts to look great. \n\n\nHopefully someone can hook me up.",
