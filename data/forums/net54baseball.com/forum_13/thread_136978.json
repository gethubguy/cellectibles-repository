      "post_content": "My attempt at slaying the Monster was short-lived.  Just three cards into it, I came to the conclusion \u2013why collect a set that I no real hope at ever completing?  I got the T206 bug after reading \u2018The Card\u2019.  I really enjoyed the book, and after owning these three cards briefly, I do understand the attraction to the cards.  I am a vintage football collector (mainly Dallas Cowboys) at heart, and should probably keep my focus on my true passion.  All that being said, I\u2019m offering these three T206 cards up for sale or trade;\n \nLarry Doyle (Throwing) PSA 4 -Piedmont\nLarry Doyle (Bat on shoulder) PSA 4 -Sweet Caporal\nSteamer Flanagan (Portrait) PSA 4.5 -Sweet Caporal\n\nThese cards should belong to a \u2018real\u2019 pre-war baseball collector.  I would consider trades for vintage football cards, graded or raw.  A specific card I\u2019m interested in is a 1951 Bowman Tom Landry RC (PSA graded).  My first choice would be to trade or sell all three together, but will consider all options.  The PSA holders are not flawed, the marks you see is just glare.  \n\n[IMG]http://www.thecowboysguide.com/misc/t206.jpg[/IMG]",

Sorry for not responding to each one, but I would like to post here what the highest offer is that I've received, and see if there is anyone who will either drop out of the running, or raise their offer.  I'm not sure of the ediquette (maybe I should have read the FAQ!), so any tips on how to handle this would be of help.\n\nThanks to all who have contacted me.  I will try to respond to everyone individually by tomorrow evening.",

No cross-over to vintage football trade, but that's ok with me.  I will try and decide by tonight unless a higher offer comes in.\n\nThanks again for all the PM's!",

In fact, no need to wait for someone else to upstage you...bump it up all you want ;).\n\nI received a very tempting trade offer late last night.  I'm trying to decide if I want to pull the trigger.
