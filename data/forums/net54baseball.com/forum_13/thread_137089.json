      "post_content": "Have approximately 450 T-206 cards that I am selling for a client. These cards vary in condition, and I am also in the process of having some of the better condition cards graded. Thought I would test the waters of interest by scanning this Griffin (San Francisco) Obak card and see what kind of offers I get on it. Please PM me with any and all offers. I will be listing many more of these great cards on here over the next few weeks, giving the forum members a shot at them before they hit Ebay. If you have any questions, please PM or email me. I have a 100% perfect feedback rating on Ebay (NVSB), and am active on the PSA BST boards (wcsportscards94558)\nThanks!\nTom\n\n\n[IMG]http://i452.photobucket.com/albums/qq246/nvsb/GriffinObakFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i452.photobucket.com/albums/qq246/nvsb/GriffinObakBack.jpg[/IMG]",
