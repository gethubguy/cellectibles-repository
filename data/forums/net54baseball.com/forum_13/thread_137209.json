When you hold the card in person half of it will flip down where it is held together. $37 + 3 S/H = $40 dlvd. Pm if interested. \n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/WillisBack_0002.jpg[/IMG][/url]\n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/WillisBack_0001.jpg[/IMG][/url]",
