I have the card in-hand and will handle the transaction. I don't have too many posts here, but I will happily provide references if needed. Happy to provide additional scans if you need them as well. \n\nIf anyone is interested, please contact me, thanks. \n\nImages here, and below: [url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/SlantyCouch/my-collection[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/SlantyCouch/my-collection/2625/t206-cobb-bat-on[/IMG]",

I finally got the seller to just come up with a price. He's looking for $2300 for this card. Price includes shipping, full insurance and Signature Confirmation. \n\nAgain I have this card in hand and can ship immediately upon completed payment. \n\nIf you are interested, please contact me. Thanks again.",
