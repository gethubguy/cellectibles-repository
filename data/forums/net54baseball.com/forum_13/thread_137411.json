The Cobby card below is what I'd throw on the table if anyone is interested. My lengthy list is below the scan of what HOF's I still need. Drop me a pm or email if you feel like doing a little horse trad'in. I can come in with cash if what you have equals more than the Cobby. Trade value is set at $1150.
