There is a designated place for ebay auction on bst...regards[/QUOTE]\n\n these are sale listings, not auctions. i'm not fond of selling on the bay, i would much rather sell to members of the board and i would have posted them on here but it's quicker for me to list them there. I own a metal business, i'm not a card dealer, only a private collector and i barely have time for it. i wish i had nothing better to do than sit here and give my opinion where members should post SALE listings, however thank you for your input forum guard :p regards",

For those of you who don't, I don't know how to explain this any more clearly.. the cards are fixed price sale listings, NOT AUCTIONS, once board members have some time to pick up what they need i may chose down the road to auction the remaining cards off in which case i will post in the ebay auctions section which i am well aware of thank you... sorry if i don't have a dedicated card selling website like others here have who post links when they have cards available.. only a ebay store supscription i pay for every month and seldom use. these are all dupes and lower grades of my sgc registry set: [url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=239&userset=4491[/url] i would also be interested in trades for cards i need to complete or upgrade the set. i have approx 200 more sgc 40's and up i will be offering for sale or trade at fair prices to members of this board. Many of you know i am very easy going and reasonable but i have little patience for this bs so i am finished with these replies. If Scott or Leon feel that i am violating board rules here i will gladly resign from this forum. For the rest of you please keep your opinions and commision based website links to yourselves. \n\nThank You,\nKristopher J. Lill",
