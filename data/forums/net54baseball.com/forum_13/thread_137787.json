I've seen the T 206, a E card and a great post card with him inset as the manager!\nLong story about Mr. Isbell: His T 206 was among the first T cards I ever owned: it was a 206 that was creased to hell with acid eating away part of the right border! lol, I'd love to get a beat up card of him for the memories!\nThank you,\nBill Hedin\n3 Murray Rd\nFramingham, MA 01701\n[url]bh3443@aol.com[/url]",
