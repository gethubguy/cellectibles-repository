Don't want to spend the money on a PSA5 and then spend more money to cross it over to SGC to find out that they won't cross it over at a 5.  Just not worth the time and money to take a chance like that.\n\nThe Chase, White Cap looks like a nice card, but again, not interested in raw cards right now.  Strictly SGC50 or better.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\nPhil",
