      "post_content": "Hi Ralph,\nHave two duplicates, one matching your want list with a Sovereign 350 back (looks to me like the apple-green variety), which I can part with for $80. Sharp corners, good picture and registration, a little miscentered to the bottom.  The other's a Sweet Cap 350 back (SGC 50, can provide scans and price if you're interested).  Price includes delivery and paypal fees.  Scans below, and e-mail sent as well.\nBest of luck on your back run,\n--S\n\n[IMG]https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5Klocu2k8PI/TWMr70SZwlI/AAAAAAAAFYI/JY6DMA0uDF8/s640/T206%252520Willetts%252520-%252520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u31xc4l776w/TWMr8SCpv5I/AAAAAAAAFYQ/6OaXLsU0GDw/s640/T206%252520Willetts%252520-%252520rear.jpg[/IMG]",
