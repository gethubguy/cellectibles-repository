      "post_content": "I have a lower condition large letter P2 of Cy Young available for sale.  Scans are below.  The pin would be in great condition if not for some \"foxing\" along the edges of the pin.  Image of Cy is great and the back is complete with the paper insert.  Pin is not graded, but I would guess it would come in at a 2?\n\nA nice collector's grade \"period\" piece of Cy Young that doesn't break the bank.\n\n$46.00 shipped.",
