I would like a straitght up trade since the values are the same.  Mine isn't in great shape and ungraded and am looking for the same.  Back condition isn't as important as the image.  Soft or rounded corners and edges ok.  Really any poor example is considered.\nPlease email if you might be interested.\nAgain mine is in poor shape as well just to let you know.\nThanks,\nDrew",
