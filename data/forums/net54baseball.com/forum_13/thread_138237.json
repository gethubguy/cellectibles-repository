      "post_content": "For sale is a Kotton Tobacco card of Bob Bescher.  This card has definitely seen better days but it makes it much more affordable (or cheap).  The front looks pretty bad with some missing material and paper.  The back ad looks a little nicer not showing as much paper loss.  $60 or best offer...this price includes S&H.  I prefer to receive paypal at [url]acowan19@gmail.com[/url].  Feel free to email me at that same address with any questions.\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/For%20Sale/Bescher.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/T-cards/Ad%20Backs/Kotton.jpg[/IMG]",
