      "post_content": "Over a few years I took the time to build complete subsets from the T205 and T206 set.  The T205 consists of all the St. Louis Cardinals cards (except the Bresnahan Open Mouth variation).  The T205 subsets consist of all St. Louis Cardinals and Browns cards.  The total number of cards are 49 in this subset.  On top of collection St. Louis cards, I also focused on getting a variety of ad backs.  I don't have any of the really rare backs but I do have two Carolina Brights and one Brown Hindu.  I'll provide links to my photobucket with all the ad backs and front scans of all the cards.  Most cards are RAW but a couple are graded.  I'd grade the overall quality of the lot to be VG.  Here is a list:\n\nT205:\nBresnahan (mouth closed) - Piedmont\nCorridon - Polar Bear\nEvans - Sovereign\nHarmon (both ears) - Polar Bear\nHarmon (left ear, FAIR) - Hassan\nHauser - Piedmont\nHuggins - Polar Bear\nKonetchy - Piedmont\nLush - Honest Long Cut\nOakes - American Beauty Green\nPhelps - Honest Long Cut\n\nT206:\nBarbeau - Carolina Brights\nBliss - Cycle 350\nBresnahan (portrait) - Sweet Cap 150 Factory 649 OP\nBresnahan (with bat) - Piedmont 350\nByrne - Sovereign 350\nCharles - Piedmont 350\nCriger - Sweet Cap 150\nCriss - Sweet Cap 150\nDineen - Piedmont 350\nEvans - Sweet Cap 350\nFerris - Piedmont 150\nGeyer - American Beauty 460\nGilbert - Sweet cap 350\nGraham - Tolstoi\nHoffman - American Beauty 350 w/Frame\nHowell (hand at waist) - Piedmont 350-460\nHowell (portrait) - Piedmont 350\nHulswitt - Sovereign 350\nJones - Hindu Brown\nKonetchy (glove above head) - Old Mill\nKonetchy (glove near ground) - Sweet Cap 350-460 Fact 42\nLake (ball in hand) - Sovereign 460\nLake (no ball) - El Principe de Gales\nMcAleese - Piedmont 350\nPelty (horizontal) - Piedmont 150\nPelty (vertical) - Tolstoi\nPhelps - Sovereign 350\nPowell - Sovereign 150\nRhodes - Carolina Brights\nShaw - El Principe de Gales\nStephens - Sovereign 350\nStone - Sovereign 150\nWaddell (portrait) - Piedmont 150\nWaddell (throwing) - Sweet Cap 150 \nWallace - Piedmont 350\nWilliams - Piedmont 350\nWillis (throwing) - Polar Bear\nWillis (with bat) - Polar Bear\n\nLink to Ad Backs:\n[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/T-cards/Ad%20Backs/[/url]\n\nLink to Card Fronts:\n[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/For%20Sale/[/url]\n\nConsidering the amount of cards, inclusion of HOFers and back variety and rarity I'm selling this lot for $1800 or best offer (S/H included).  I'd like to sell this as a whole and not break it up.  I'd consider selling the T205s separate from the T206s but that is as far as I want to break it down.  My preferred payment is paypal at [url]acowan19@gmail.com[/url].  If you have any questions feel free to email me at that same address.",
