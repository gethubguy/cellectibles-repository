Take a look on ebay at graded cards with good pics you can zoom in on and compare. \n\nKris",

We've all had our learning experiences in the hobby.  Don't let it discourage your love for the hobby, keep your head up bro...\n\nNow to Matt's proposal.  I love the idea.  Would Bo Jackson count as a \"top bad financial decision\"?  All kidding aside, I imagine there would be some very interesting responses in a thread like that...\n\nI think my worst would be buying an \"autographed\" card from a seller on ebay, who seemed to dealt with mostly Matchbox cars, and junk parts without pictures for anything.  I thought I was just getting a steal from a guy who didn't know what he was doing.  Boy was that an understatement..  Turns out the guy didn't know the difference between an autograph and a facsimile signature on a card...  I got a simple \"Are you sure? I thought it was signed\" and a quick and easy refund..  Coincidentally, while I joke about the money I'd lost collecting Bo as a kid, this also happened to be a Bo Jackson card..",
