Only offers of 18k or greater will be considered.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n\nPlease send offers via Email only to:\n[url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nP.S.  Sorry for the tiny image ... not really sure why that happened - I'd be happy to supply a full sized scan for anyone that is genuinely interested.  There are creases on this card and I would speculate that it would get a '2'.",
