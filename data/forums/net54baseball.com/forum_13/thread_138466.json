      "post_content": "Hello.  I'm looking for the final two T207's I need to complete the set, Birmingham and McCarthy.  I have tons to trade and would even trade in your favor.  Also would be glad to buy for a reasonable (or possibly even an unreasonable) price.  Lower grade, even total beaters, are fine.  Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] if you have either of these cards available.  Thanks!",
