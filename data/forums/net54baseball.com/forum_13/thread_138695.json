I would like to talk to that person to see if they are interested in selling their card.\nFor those who dont know what Im talking about the card looks like this:\n\n[IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/weimer.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf you are aware of the current owner please PM me or email me at [url]blunder19@aol.com[/url]\n\nThanks\nJamie\nPS: I'm interested in any ghost image with a player pictured on the back, or a different player (from the one in the card) pictured on the front.",
