      "post_content": "The card is pretty strong.   There is a crease from the upper right down through his cap to his nose.  Other than that this is a really clean card.  The back has what looks like a postmark on the back.   I'm not sure how much the final scan will show but I can make out different areas that looks like \"Wash\", \"Sta.\" and \"Balt\".   There's also a mark on the bottom back.  Price = $110ppd.  thanks   Peter",
