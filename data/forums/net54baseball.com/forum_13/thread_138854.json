One runs from the knob of his bat down to the letters \"SC\" in the word San Francisco and the other runs from the middle of his back into the same letters. They really hide themselves well though in the green psychedelic back drop which gives it the look of a much higher graded example than what the flip states. Please drop me a PM if you like em'...... Thx, Tony",
