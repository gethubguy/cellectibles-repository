There are a couple of wrinkles over Cobb's bat. The lithographic printing is a bit off. Otherwise a very nice card with no major creases.\n\nI will ship via priority mail with insurance.\n\n$925 postpaid if paying by Paypal\n$900 postpaid if paying by check or money order\n\nAlso, open to trading, give or take some cash.
