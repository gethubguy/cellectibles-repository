      "post_content": "Greetings, I'm interested in obtaining a tougher back T206 of John Ganzel, brother of 19th century catcher Charlie Ganzel (a member of the Detroit Wolverines).  I would be happy with any of the following backs:\n\nDrum (assuming it exists)\nBroad Leaf\nCarolina Brights\n<del>American Beauty</del> - purchased July 2011\n<del>Cycle</del> - purchased July 2011\nTolstoi\n\nCard does not need to be graded but should be capable of receiving a number grade in the range of 2-6 with good eye appeal.\n\nThank You,",
