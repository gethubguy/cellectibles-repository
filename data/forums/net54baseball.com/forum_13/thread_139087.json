      "post_content": "Hey Guys, \n\nJohnson hands at chest  (PB)  SOLD!\nHas a tear about 1/4\" long on bottom left side.  Its about 1/4\" from the bottom of card.  Cant really see it from the scan or if card is in a toploader, but its there.  Not exactly sure how that would affect grading, but if not for that, the card is a possible 4 IMHO.  \n\nWillis batting  (PB)  SOLD!\nLooks pretty good to me, no creases, Ill let you be the judge, but Id say VG.\n\nPrices include shipping.  Payment via PP gift or money owed, or check or MO please.\n\nEmail or PM or reply here.  \n\n[url]thauswirth01@sbcglobal.net[/url]\n\nThanks Net54!!!",
