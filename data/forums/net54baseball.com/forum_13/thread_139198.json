      "post_content": "For Sale- T206 Joe Doyle, hands over head, PSA 1 with Tolstoi back.\n\nFinal reduction on this one.\n\nVERY difficult to find in this back.  In my opinion, the toughest of all Doyle backs by a slight margin over El Principe and Sovereign.  Only a couple have been graded by PSA and only a couple have been offered for sale in the past 5 or so years, this being one of them.   It\u2019s not a gem but it presents well.  There is some paper loss on the reverse due to album removal. Reduced to $150+ insured shipping costs.  Please send questions/inquiries to my forum mailbox.\n\n[IMG]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n88/MARCBOURGEA/T206_Doyle_Tolstoi_front-b-1.jpg[/IMG]",
