      "post_content": "$400/shipped\n\nUp for sale is a lot of 51 T206 cards.  The overall grade is poor, with a few fair cards as well.  Various backs included such as Cycle, Sovereign, Polar Bear, plenty of Piedmonts and Sweet Caps, but nothing major.  All cards have a slight wave-like warp when viewed in profile.  Nothing major, but it is there.\n\nAll front and back scans can be found here:\n\n[url]http://chasingthemonster.com/t206.html[/url]\n\nPrefer to sell as a lot only.  PayPal preferred. \n\nThanks for looking!",
