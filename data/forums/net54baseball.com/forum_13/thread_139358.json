I think it was abit too technical, but Iam very happy to own or trade. Thank you for the acknowledgement of the card. I havent seen any with these corners in the 22 yrs of prewar collecting. When I had all the Evers in E cards and 15 portraits, this would have never been on the table .When have you seen this card with these boarders and centered ?\n\nTrading is fun or cash is good as well. My opinion and a 10x. I still value it as a 6.5 , what do I know?\n\n;)",
