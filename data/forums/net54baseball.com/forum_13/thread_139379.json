      "post_content": "I have a few cards available to trade (or sell).  I'm interested mainly in pre-war Red Sox cards.  I prefer graded.  Try me - send me a PM!  \n\nT3 McConnell - great color, paper loss/major chip on upper right corner, I believe there is a piece of tape on the reverse, but I'll check that and post a back scan soon too.  A nice card that looks better than its likely technical grade.  Price is $SOLD The McConnell is now SOLD!\n\nCollins-McCarthy Milton Stock (SGC 40) - awesome centering, a real nice card for the grade, clean front and back (scan soon).  Price is $80 + shipping.\n\n1948 Leaf Bobby Doerr (PSA 5).  Price is $45 + shipping.\n\n1959 Fleer Ted Williams #63 (SGC 86) - this is the card from the set that has long been regarded as a \"real card\" of Ted and valued accordingly - nice pose with facsimile auto - obviously centered to the left, but a sharp card.  Price is $38 + shipping.\n\nPM me with any trade offers!",
