      "post_content": "I've battled the monster for a few years and have the \"end\" in sight.  I still need 7 common cards and hope to get some help from the boards.  These cards won't finish the set for me.  I still need a dozen HOF'ers and 6 SL'ers plus there's those pesky 6 cards to deal with as well.  But, these cards are on the list and the budget can afford them.  Please let me know if you can help on any of these cards.  I'm looking for PSA 3-4.5 or SGC 40-50.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBrian\n\nYou guys are awesome, now need only 1 common!!\n\nFRED TENNEY\n\nPicked these up:\nDANNY MURPHYBATTING       Thanks Larry!!\nHARRY DAVISH.
