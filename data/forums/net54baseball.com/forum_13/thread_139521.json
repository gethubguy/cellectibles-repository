      "post_content": "I have available the following lot of T207 cards.  As anybody who has attempted it can attest, this is an extremely challenging set with at least 70-80 tough cards and some that hardly ever come up for sale.  Very underrated in value also, as all of these cards are far scarcer than the more widely collected T205 and T206 sets.\n\nI am pricing these cards individually based on condition and relative scarcity.  All prices are delivered.  Payment via any method you prefer.   I would also consider trades for cards I need from other sets.  Thanks for looking and please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions or to reserve cards.\n\n\nCards Pictured (removing **SOLD** cards for easier viewing):\n\n\nRaw Cards-\n\nCovington $12\nDanforth $18\nDevlin $12\nFerry $9\nKnabe $8\nB. Lord $8\nMcLean $12\nJ. Miller $30\nMullin (no \"D\" on cap) $45\nSnodgrass $18\n\n\nGraded Cards-\n\nCarey (PSA 1) HOF $60\nDowney (SGC A) one of the toughest cards in the set, even more so with Anonymous back $250\nDoyle (SGC 10) $17\nMarquard (SGC 20) HOF $50",
