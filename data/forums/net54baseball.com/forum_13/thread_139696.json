I'm going to free them from their slabs anyways...\n\nFor trades, please see my other post with all the T cards I have for sale.\n\n[url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\n\nWANTS:\n\nT205 Gold Border:\nI'm looking to add all of the T205 Cubs with the following backs:\n\nCycle\nAmerican Beauty\nSovereign\n\nHere are the Cubs I need in the T205 Set in either Cycle, American Beauty, or Sovereign backs:\n\nArcher: Need Cycle & American Beauty\nBrown: Need Cycle & American Beauty\nChance: Need Sovereign, Cycle, & American Beauty\nEvers: Need Sovereign & American Beauty\nFoxen: Need Cycle & American Beauty\nGraham: Have Hassan, need 2 of either Sovereign, hlc, polar bear, american beauty, cycle, etc. I don't know what backs are possible for this SP.\nKling:  Need Cycle & American Beauty\nKroh:  Need Sovereign, Cycle & American Beauty\nMcintire:  Need American Beauty\nNeedham: Need Sovereign, Cycle & American Beauty\nOverall:  Need Cycle & American Beauty\nPfeister:  Need Cycle & American Beauty\nReulbach:  Need Sovereign & American Beauty\nRichie:  Need Cycle\nSchulte:  Need Sovereign, Cycle & American Beauty\nShean: Have Hassan, need 2 of either Sovereign, hlc, polar bear, american beauty, cycle, etc. I don't know what backs are possible for this SP.\nSheckard: Need Sovereign, Cycle & American Beauty\nSteinfeldt: Need American Beauty\nTinker: Need Cycle & American Beauty\n\n\nT207 Needs:\n\nWard Miller  ...I know...\nVic Saier  \n\nT3:\n\nI'd love to get a Frank Chance T3 that has a nice appearance, but has a low technical grade or even an A grade. It could have 5 pinholes, don't care...paper loss on back - whatever. It's one of my favorite cards, and I'd love to get it. I'd prefer SGC for aesthetics, but would consider PSA.\n\n\n\n[url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.",
