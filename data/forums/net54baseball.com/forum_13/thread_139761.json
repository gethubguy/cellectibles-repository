I'll be three booths down and 1 booth over; so I am the third booth in the second row from the main entrance.\n\nI will have a nice T205 set for $25,000 cash (only) too.\n\nMany T210 Old Mills.\n\n200-300 T206's.\n\nMuch more.\n\nSee me at the show next Weds - Sunday outside of Chicago.\n\nSteve Sabow\n[url]Dynamictwo@aol.com[/url]",
