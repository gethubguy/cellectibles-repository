      "post_content": "Stright from the annals of \"buy the card not the holder\" I bring you this T3 George Mullin. Someone decided to send this card to PRO to grade and encapsulate. Whomever did the grading on the card was obviously heavily inebriated at the time, as they graded this card as an 8 NM-MT.\n\nUm...no.\n\nIt is pretty nice, however, so I am selling it as a raw VG-EX example. Scans are below. I am too lazy to crack the thing so I will leave it up to the buyer to do that...or for the buyer to resubmit it to a more sober grading company for accurate grading! \n\nFirst offer of $350 takes the card, shipped.\n\nTom C\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/001-43.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/002-35.jpg[/IMG]",
