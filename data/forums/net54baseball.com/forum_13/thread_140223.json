      "post_content": "FS Fiene Throwing PSA 4 Holder..........BUT..........The front looks like a 5 to me but the back has paper loss, which in my experience PSA should have made this a PSA 2.  Looks like they blew this one.  If you do not like for your low grade set, crack open for your low raw set.  Great front, centered very well, and I cannot find a crease.   $20 shipped w/DC.  Payment Paypal or M.O. First email takes [url]jct43@embarqmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks,\nCharlie",
