Clean front, light crease on back to the right of the word \"The.\"\n\n2)  T206 Chance (batting pose)  MOVED TO EBAY\n\nFormerly in an SGC 10 holder.\n\nThe Good:  No creases, no wrinkles, strong corners.\n\nThe Bad:  Question mark shaped dot pattern on face and neck.  Looks like it was done with a pin or sharp edge of a paper clip.  Not deep, doesn't go through to the back, but you can feel it if you run your finger over it.  Ironically, there has been speculation over the years that Frank Chance was indeed killed by a gigantic question mark.\n\nThe Ugly:  Paper loss on back.\n\nMy email:  [url]boboinnes33@gmail.com[/url]",
