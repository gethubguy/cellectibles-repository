      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nUp for sale is the pictured T201 Rucker / Daubert - card is graded a PSA 2.  Looks pretty solid for the grade, the only real wear I see is where the fold in the card is.  Corners are in decent shape and I'm not seeing any creases.\n\n$30 and the card is yours.  PM or email to [url]scooter0729@yahoo.com[/url].\n\nThanks for looking,\nScott",
