      "post_content": "Looking for the following T206:\n\n1) McBride\n2) McIntyre (Brooklyn)\n3) Pastorius\n4) Steinfeldt (portrait)\n\nImportant:  I'm only looking for cards that are completely crease and wrinkle free.  Also, no paper loss.\n\nBasically, I'm looking for these cards in approximately SGC 40- 50 type condition.  Though if the card is trimmed a bit, that's okay (provided you let me know beforehand).  They can be graded or ungraded, as long as they meet the aforementioned specs.  Also, if you're looking to sell your PSA 6 or SGC 80, I'm sure the card looks great, but it's probably outside the range I'm looking to pay.\n\nmy email:  [url]boboinnes33@gmail.com[/url]",
