      "post_content": "If you place a value on a card solely by the number on the flip and what VCP says it's worth then these cards are not for you. ;) If you base value though off of eye appeal alone then these may be right up your alley. Two of the prettiest 2's you'll ever see. NO CREASES on either!! Mr. Evers has a small tick of paper loss from scrapbook removal just above the letters \"AR\" in the word cigarettes on the back. Wajo per PSA has a couple very light paper rubs on the reverse just above the letter \"A\" in cigarettes and above the letters \"FA\" in factory that are very hard to see. Please drop me a pm or email if interested. Prices shown include all shipping charges delivered to your door. Paypal A-Okay with no extra fee added.
