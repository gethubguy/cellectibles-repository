I did send him to PSA but they called and said they had no doubt he was real but didn't have a holder he would fit in properly and sent him back raw, however i found out later through the grapevine that when he was there he realized they were going to try to put him in a cabinet card holder and undergrade him so he ate the grader. I confronted them about it but PSA refused to comment on it, supposedly there is more to the story tho.. i found out the grader that was eaten was the same guy who graded all the psa 6's i have tried to cross that have come back trimmed so i don't feel bad now... idk maybe SGC ?\n\nRite now i keep him in my genie lamp cuz he takes up too much space otherwise. My genie isn't too happy about it but it's his own fault.. i have 1 more wish he owes me, i tried wishing for more wishes but he refused so until i figure out what i want they are lampmates.",

(if u say that's wat she said no one will believe u.. i tried) Nothin for nothin Leon but this is my forum slave thread and it's a little unappropriate to be barging in and proclaiming your undying true love for my most ridiculously expensive overpriced t206 card on ebay... idk if the breeding thing will work but nonetheless i feel the love in your words and it touches my soul so it's yours for what i paid for it + 6 pack of guiness but no flugal valve or case of blinker fluid cuz that stuff is hard to come by and not cheap.. i'm sure you don't want them anyway.. it is common knowledge that peasant/forum owners have similiar incomes as brain surgeons and rocket scientists so one of your many assitants i would imagine handles petty vehicle maintenance items.. do you even have a car ? every time i recall u makin a public appearance you arrive in ur private jumbojet - forumforce 1 and then get swarmed by women but have never seen u arrive in a car... don't jumbojets get shity gas mileage ? What am i saying ??? what do you care about fuel mileage..you wipe you ass with $100's .... before u deny it may i remind u i have the video but rest assured i don't show it to anyone.. the original and only copy is locked in my safe inside the genie lamp. Nessie, myself and the genie are the only beings that have viewed the tape, No worries tho, Nessie can't talk and without me knowing it, that little scumbag genie made me use my first wish to swear him to secrecy about it, all ways remember to watch what u say to a genie.. if u spent the last couple thousand years stuck in a lamp with your only purpose being to get passed around granting 3 wishes to every tom dick and harry that rubs your lamp, you'd be a little synical too so they get a kick out of tricking u and then rubbing ur face in it.. yea funny..  so i used my 2nd and wished nessie would stay in the lamp until i wished my 3rd and final wish.. guess who's laughin now..  ain't that miserable little funny man in the lamp....",

Leons words of pure desire and odd but wonderful card  procreation dreams have been felt deeply by collectors worldwide, i'm sure in usual character he's gonna try to give me double or triple the all ready ridiculously overpriced price however i will refuse it so he can direct the funds toward better uses such as loaning o'bama even more money which ok, yes, seems and is a complete waste but what the hell, it's only money.. odss are Leon's pocket change may eventually enable this twit to bring \"change\" i didn't say odds are good.. Even the vast monetary reserves of Leon's pockets may only be able to birth a even better campaign slogan like \" CHANGE.. HELLS YEA MAYBE BABY!\" idk what the outcome but feel a true heaping shitload of luck will be necesary.. \n\nAs for carlos i'm quite certain his energy is focused elsewhere these days and some things are just best left unconfirmed... i have a strong position on the tiger's blood and every warlock looks as though he will rip ur arm from the socket but at the end of the night when the bar gets out they all want an afterparty at your house and end up cryin about thier horrible past relationships as the sun is coming up.. i'm not saying all but every one i have partied with are emotional disasters and depressing to be around at that point.. it's annoying during sunrise or whenever so i don't let them come over anymore, i try to aviod them completely now but when they ask i just tell them my dragon burned my house down yesterday so no afterparty tnite and they stumble away depressed and wasted searching for someone to be thier free therapist and torture endlessly.\n\nif by chance u see email me ur # (kris@broadhurstindustries.com), had sum Winning to report.. my ball & chained personal hip mounted andriodian wee little black box of communications updated and lost everyones fone# i despise talkin to - Winning !... along with those i enjoy verbaly spanking repeatedly on how my lion blood is such of the King of all land predators and yea havin tiger blood is badass too.. just a little pussier than Lion's.. i still owe u for stealing that gold digging pirate whore of an exgirlfriend.. i told u she was a bitch.. talk soon..

Where u gettin banned to ? hopefully just the peasant/forum slave dungeon and not the dreaded peasant/forum owners hot & sweaty hard labor factory.. aka \"the secret sexy breeding facility\" which no man has ever returned from. This is a wild guess but i take it u didn't get the underground peasant/forum slave memo that was goin around forever about just humoring him... pretty sure everyone knows what the dealio is there.. i just can't believe ur not vaporized rite now from that post.. thank goodness.. hopefully it's a dungeon banning u got which ain't so bad.. i break in there a couple nites a week cuz honestly it's the best party in town, some crazy shit goes down there late nite and a good time is had by all thanks to willy's moonshine. u can't miss him, 90 sumthin year old guy who's been chained by the neck to the wall at the end of d block/cave for like 50 years or so. he has two lazy eyes and can't see shit out of either, the biggest buck teeth i have ever seen, and something that appears to be a third testicle growing on the side of his forhead. Even tho he can't see for shit he can sense when someone is staring and he gets all self concious about it, he's pretty cool tho and makes kickass moonshine. I once asked why he was doin time and he started twitchin furiously and then exposed his terrets syndrome. I asked around but no one knows why he's there so don't bother asking unless ur lookin for a cheap laugh.. i nearly pissed myself when he had the terrets fit... \n\nWe are all prayin to the forum gods your destiny does not lie within the forsaken walls of the factory. Less is known of the secret sexy breeding facility than is even known of the production of T206's. If your fate is so written, all i can offer in the lines of advice is: if the soap hits the floor just leave it and finish showerin soapless.. it is rumored that when vintage sports cards are horny they don't take no for an answer so please be careful. Hopefully i'll se ya next thursday for happy hour in the dungeon, if so around 2 am i'll disguise my voice to pretend i'm a cop which makes him nervous as hell and then make him give a sobriety test so u can see him try to follow my finger with 2 lazy eyes.. it seriously never gets old..  We will all be waitin on the outside for ya buddy, hang in there !\n\nThis ancient digital paprus paper will self destruct in 3.. 2.. 1.. pooofff",

I just unblocked you so i could view your contribution to my new thread here and to my surprise it was just what i was hoping for.  I\u2019m a little busy at the moment with my new uninvited friend hurricane irene blowin two trees down at my neighbors house so i have to go fire up the chainsaws & excavator to clear his driveway but as soon as i have a sec I\u2019ll post my sincere apologies for your concerns and express how valuable your opinion is to me. i am very excited and looking forward to it.\n Just because I am soo fond of you i will place a rating of PG-13 (some adult content) on the thread title and my initial post as I should have in the beginning to properly warn u and other likeminded sensitive, underage, or underprivileged individuals who may be challenged in the appreciation of any specific or all types of humor. \nStay Dry..",
