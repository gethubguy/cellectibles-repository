      "post_content": "Rarely seen advertising envelope from the Wells-Whitehead Tobacco Company, original manufacturer of the Carolina Brights brand of cigarettes.  Postmarked April 28, 1903.  \n\nWells Whitehead was secretly acquired by the ATC during 1903, and the Carolina Brights brand continued to be marketed as an \"independent\" (i.e., not associated with the tobacco trust).  Within a few years, true ownership became known, ATC acknowledged its role, the Wilson NC factory closed and production moved to the trust's large cigarette factory in Richmond (Factory #25). \n\n$75, shipping included. Please email me (jimonym@hotmail.com) with any questions.\n\nThanks.\n\n[IMG]http://www.jimonym.com/Images/CB.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.jimonym.com/Images/CBdate.jpg[/IMG]",
