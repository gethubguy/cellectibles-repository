      "post_content": "Not easy cards to come by and I've spent a few years putting this group together.  Time for someone else to enjoy them.  There are 28 cards in this collection altogether of various grades.  No bad looking cards in the group at all and none have any back damage at all.  Many of these fall into the 30-40 range with a couple higher.\n\nOne note, the Daniels has a blue \"ghosted\" silhouette on top of the card.  Possibly a wet-sheet transfer but kind of interesting.\n\nAsking $2800 delivered.  Scans available upon request.  Thanks much!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\nCallahan VG - faint corner wrinkle, sharp corners\nJohn Collins SGC A - wrinkling\nCole EX - sharp corners/edges, no wrinkling\nCovington VG - no wrinkling..only tiny touches to corners\nDaniels FR - neat blue GHOSTING on front....2 heavier wrinkles\nDelehanty PSA 3\nDerrick GAI 3\nDevlin SGC 30\nDooin SGC 20\nFerry SGC 40\nGardner SGC 50\nGowdy SGC A - nice looking card with some wrinkling\nHallinan SGC 10 - worn corners\nHenry SGC 10 - wrinkling\nHogan VG/EX - no wrinkling, very sharp corners...tiny bit of chipping\nKonetchy - SGC 30\nLapp SGC 10 - wrinkling\nMcIntyre VG - no wrinkling..only tiny touches to corners\nNeedham VG+ - slight touches to corners, no wrinkling\nNunamaker FR - Chip in side, corner wrinkles\nSchaefer GD/VG - tiny wrinkle at bottom\nSchardt SGC 10 - wrinkling\nSeveroid SGC 40\nStreet SGC 30\nStrunk GD/VG - mostly sharp corners, one tiny wrinkle on side\nTooley SGC 10 - heavier crease in corner\nWolverton SGC 10 - heavier wrinkle\nYerkes SGC 40",
