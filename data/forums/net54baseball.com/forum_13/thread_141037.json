      "post_content": "Hello everyone I have a PSA 4 Helmar Stamp of Mordecai Brown I am selling. I am not sure what price to set on it because I do not deal with a lot of these. It looks great and it is very rare.  Please send offers to [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  I am always happy to negotiate on price.  Scan is attached below.  If I do not get any offers is a few days I will put it up on ebay.  \n\nTony Turner",
