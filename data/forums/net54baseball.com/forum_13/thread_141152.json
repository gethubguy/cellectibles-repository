If you have the Tolstoi, Carolina Brights, Drum or Red Cross... let me know.  I'll make it worth your while.  \n\n[IMG]http://i1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/1910-1920/QuinnBacks2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTrade bait (not looking to sell these cards, for trade only, thx):\n\n[IMG]http://i1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/1910-1920/1909_T206_Hindu_Bell.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1023.photobucket.com/albums/af353/jasonleemiller/1910-1920/1909_T206_Lenox_Schaefer.jpg[/IMG]\n\nStreet has been traded but I have a lot of other trade bait.
