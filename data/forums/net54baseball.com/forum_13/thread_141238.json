      "post_content": "One of the really difficult cards in a very difficult set to try to find.  The Magee is often mentioned as the 2nd toughest card to only the Henry and along with Baumgardner, carries the lowest population count between PSA and SGC with 6 examples combined.  \n\nConditionwise, the card is still very displayable too with a tiny pinhole at the top and a mild scrape at the bottom to account for the 10 holder.  Back is clean and damage free.\n\nNot sure how to really price this one.  At one time, the premium on the toughest t222s was pretty immense.  I haven't paid much attention to this set lately so I'd be open to offers, both cash and trade.  Thanks in advance!\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=45087&d=1314927989[/IMG]",

As of this post, Lee Magee's t222 has the lowest pop count of any card in the set (tied with Baumgardner) at 6 cards between SGC and PSA combined.   Been a few years since I've seen one of these as well....\n\nAsking $750 OBO....\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian",
