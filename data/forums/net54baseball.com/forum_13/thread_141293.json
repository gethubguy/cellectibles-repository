      "post_content": "In the course of putting together my low grade T206 set, I've come across some doubles, either through the purchase of lots or through accidental purchase.  Ideally, I'd like to trade some of my doubles for other cards I need for my set and have put together a list of what I have available.  \n\nBelow is the picture of the Bell Follow Through with a Sweet Caporal Wet Transfer on the front.  \n\n[IMG]http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff453/Idiottax/For%20Trade/BellWetTransferFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[URL=\"http://s1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff453/Idiottax/For%20Trade/\"]For Trade[/URL]\n\nAside from the from the Bell, most are lower grade commons, though there are two Zimmermans in the album, because I am having a hard time figuring out which one to keep.  \n\nBell (Follow Through)\nCamnitz (Arms Crossed)\nDahlen (Boston)\nFletcher\nGanley\nGraham\nHowell (Portrait)\nMattern\nNattress\nOldring\nRandall\nRaymond\nSnodgrass\nZimmerman\n\n[URL=\"http://s1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff453/Idiottax/For%20Trade%20Flaking/\"]For Trade Flaking[/URL]\n\nThese cards all came from the same lots and are starting to have some flaking or other major condition issues.  The Tinker (Hands on Knees) is really my idea of what a filler card could be.\n\nBrain\nCrandall (No Cap)\nDubuc\nStephens\nTenney\nTinker (Hands on Knees)\nTitus\nWiltse\n\nIf anyone is interested, let me know and I can send along my needs list, since I am just north of the halfway point in completing the set.",
