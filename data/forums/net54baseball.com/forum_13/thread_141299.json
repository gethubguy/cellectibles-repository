      "post_content": "Hi...I am selling my collection of T206 cards (70 cards).  I am unable to attach my spreadsheet with the cards for sale and the prices on this website (not quite sure why).  I can e-mail you a copy of the spreadsheet if you are interested in seeing.  I am willing to consider all offers on any of the cards.  Please add $3.50 for shipping.  I will only sell through paypal.  I can send pictures of any card you are interested in seeing through e-mail.  I can be reached at [url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url].  I will send photos as soon as possible (I need a friend to assist me with uploading them).  Thank you for your interest!\n\nRachel\n[url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url]",
