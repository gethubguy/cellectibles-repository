The White Cap doesn't have any disturbance to the tape.  Removing the tape on these is beyond my expertise.\n\nBoth the \"cap\" versions are extremely presentable.  Great color and register; no creases.  Flaws of the portrait can be seen on the scan.\n\nPrice includes delivery.  Standard/regular paypal preferred.  Priced as singles:\nPortrait: SOLD\nDark Cap: SOLD\nWhite Cap: SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100015/mattyF/web.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100015/mattyB/web.jpg[/IMG]",
