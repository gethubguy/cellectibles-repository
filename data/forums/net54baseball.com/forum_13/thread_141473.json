      "post_content": "LOWER PRICES ON TWO REMAINING PSA CARDS:\n\nI want to sell the two remaining PSA cards...both actually very nice cards.  \n\nWagner is valued at $80 on a website that always undervalues the cards...\nHeinie Wagner - Bat on right shoulder - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - PSA 4 - was $90 - then asking $78 - new lower price $68\n\nJack White - Buffalo, Follow Through - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - PSA 4 - was $70 - then asking $52 - new lower price $48\n\nIf anyone is willing to get both of those cards, the total would usually be $116...but I would do it for $110 if getting both.  I really want to sell these cards.  I can only accept paypal payments...and I will cover shipping charges as well.  If interested, please e-mail as soon as possible at [url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url].  Thank you for your interest!!! \n\nHi!  I unfortunately have to sell my collection of T206 cards.  I have already posted information about my sale.  I was selling 70 cards and 16 have sold.  To try to sell as many as possible in the shortest amount of time, I am discounting the prices on my PSA cards.  I am still willing to consider ALL offers even lower than what I am asking...especially if you're getting more than one card.  I also have many graded SGC T206 cards available as well if you are interested.  E-mail me at [url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url] if you want to see scans, make offers, or inquire about any of my SGC cards as well.  I just figured I'd start by discounting the PSA's since I don't have too many of those.  Here is the list of the PSA cards (shipping has been costing me around $5 per card, but as a courtesy, I will cover the shipping costs as well):\n\nChristy Mathewson (HOF) - Dark Cap - Sweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 42 (Overprint) - PSA 3 - was $415 - now asking $385  SOLD\n\nHal Chase - Throwing, Dark Cap - Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25 - PSA 4 - was $80 - now asking $70  SOLD\n\nHeinie Wagner - Bat on right shoulder - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - PSA 4 - was $90 - now asking $78\n\nJack White - Buffalo, Follow Through - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - PSA 4 - was $70 - now asking $52\n\nJoe Lake - With Ball - Polar Bear - PSA 3 - was $60 - now asking $49  SOLD\n\nLou Ritter - Fielding - Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30 - PSA 4 - was $70 - now asking $55  SOLD\n\nRube Marquard (HOF) - Follow Through - Sweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 30 - PSA 4.5 - was $250 - now asking $220  SOLD\n\n\nNEW SALE:\nI really want to sell these cards, so I am going to continue by discounting my SGC 30's.  I know I may have to take a loss in order to sell these cards (it was my own fault by overpaying for some of them)  Again...I am still willing to consider ALL offers...especially if getting multiple cards. (paypal only please).  Please contact me at [url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url].  Thanks!  SGC 30's for sale are:\n\nBill Bergen - Catching - Sweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 42 OVERPRINT - SGC 30 - was $50 - now asking $42 SOLD\n\nBill Hart (SL) - Portrait - Old Mill Southern - SGC 30 - was $85 - now asking $78\n\nFrank King (SL) - Portrait - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - SGC 30 - was $65 - now asking $58\n\nHal Chase - Pink Portrait - Sweet Caporal 150 Fact. 30 - SGC 30 - was $85 - now asking $66  SOLD\n\nJesse Tannehill - Ready to Throw - Old Mill Black - SGC 30 - was $45 - now asking $36\n\nJohn Anderson - Fielding - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - SGC 30 - was $35 - now asking $26\n\nI will cover the shipping costs as well!!!!!\nThank you for your interest!!!\n-RachB4980",
