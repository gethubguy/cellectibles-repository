      "post_content": "I am trying to sell these cards as soon as possible...so I have put some on ebay and am again lowering the prices of the others.  Some on ebay don't have bids yet, so I believe I can still remove them from ebay if anyone is interested.  For the other cards, I am trying to lower the prices again before putting them on ebay as well.  New prices are listed in PURPLE\n\nIf you are interested in any, please e-mail me at [url]RachB4980@aol.com[/url]. I will cover all shipping costs as well!!  Thank you again for your interest and consideration!!!  If you are getting more than one card, I can probably go down slightly on price as well!  I am still willing to consider ALL offers too!!!!!!  Thanks again  :)\n\nAl Bridwell - Portrait, With Cap - OId Mill Black - SGC 50 - SOLD\nBill Clymer - Standing - Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30 - SGC 50 - $49 $45 $43  SOLD\nDick Hoblitzell - Fielding - Piedmont 350 Fact. 25 - SGC 40 - $40 $35 $30  SOLD\nGeorge Mullin - With Bat - Sweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 42 (Overprint) - SGC 40 - $48 $45 $44 SOLD\nGeorge Schirm - Batting - Polar Bear - SGC 40 - $42 $40 $38  SOLD\nHeinie Berger - Ready to Throw - Polar Bear - SGC 40 - $47 $44 $42  SOLD\nHooks Wiltse - Portrait, With Cap - Old Mill Black - SGC 40 - $58 $50 SOLD\nJ.J.
