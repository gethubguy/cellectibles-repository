      "post_content": "Guys...........Hello. For sale OR trade is my t206 Ty Cobb red background with Sweet Caporal back that has been slabbed 'Authentic' by PSA due to back damage/paper loss. The front of the card is pretty decent with good color (the red background appears more orange in scan, but is brighter red in person) and nice centering, however there are several creases with the majority of them to the left of Cobb's face. A couple of those are larger creases that touch his cheek area and are a result of the back damage. The card stock in that area looks to be pretty thin, but I don't see any tears. Still a visually appealing card. \n\nThe price is $365 shipped via Priority Mail with payment via Paypal gift/money owed or money order. To reserve/purchase, please PM or email me at mattpienta at yahoo dot com\n\nIf interested in a trade, I'm looking for lower grade E100's, lower grade t222's, an E95 Plank.....or a lower grade '38 Goudey Joe Dimaggio.\n\nThanks..........Matt",
