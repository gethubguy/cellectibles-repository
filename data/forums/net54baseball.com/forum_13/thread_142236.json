I've given them individual and discounted group prices; I've kept prices low, so they're firm.\nIf you want to claim an individual card, post below; first-posted gets it at the end of the day [if no one has bought the entire lot/Group].\nIf you want to buy the Group, first-posted also gets it, and the Group sale would take priority over an individual sale that day only.\n\nAll three groups, 25 cards in all, $525.\n\nGroup 1, Graded: All 5, $140, delivered.\n\nWILLIS [portrait], SGC 1 [solid card for its grade], $45, delivered\nLennox, SGC 30, $28, delivered,\nMaloney, SGC 30, $28, delivered,\nPhelan, SGC 30, $28, delivered,\nSolly Hoffman, SGC 30 [not pictured; scan coming], $28, delivered.\n\nTake off $2 combined shipping for each additional card.\n\nGroup 2, Ungraded Cards: $350 for all 15.\n\nIndividual cards: Add $1 for S/H.  Three or more cards ship for free.\n \nClarke, Columbus [name is faint with bottom cut off, but recognizable], $18,\nCamnitz, arms folded [short, likely trimmed, otherwise nice-looking card], $16White, Buffalo [nice front, no apparent creases, paper loss on back,], $18,\nMalarkey, $14,\nDonohue, $17,\nHUGGINS, portrait [paper-loss on most of back], $25,\nWALLACE [Measures up but off-center/miscut, with glue stains on back], $38,\nFLICK, beautiful card, appears Ex, measures up but is trimmed, $55,\nWILLIS, batting [nice appearance but trimmed; tiny spot on finger], $33,\nWILLIS, pitching [heavily creased but presentable], $33,\nCovaleski, $16, \nBliss [speck of paper loss on bill of cap, over eye, otherwise pretty nice] $14,\nCHANCE, orange portrait, $48,\nLattimore, $15,\nKleinow, batting, $13,\n\nNote: These cards are in 2 protective plastics, a halved penny-sleeve--which creates the appearance of a line on the outer border--and a pocket-page:\n\nGroup 3: 5 Beaters, $50, delivered. \nIndividually, $10 each + $1 S/H.\n\nMcBride [new addition, not depicted, scan upon request],\nFiene,\nStanage,\nLennox,\nHappy Smith [moving, lost a chip more paper than depicted on right border].\n \nIf you're interested in trading, I prefer ungraded cards.  \n \nNo pm's, please.
