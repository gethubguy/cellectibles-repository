I would prefer them to be authenticated, however I am always happy to buy from the respected members of this community who offer guarantees on their items as well.\n\nPlease do send me an e-mail if you have any signed cards for sale. I am looking for both common and star players.\n\nMy e-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThank you so much.",
