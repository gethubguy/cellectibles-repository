      "post_content": "$160 delivered. This is the far more difficult team variation to obtain for Brown in the T213-2 series. If you collect this series, you probably have seen many of him with St Louis for each example (if any) you have ever seen with Chicago. He played for St. Louis Fed in 1914, Chicago Fed in 1915, and back with Chicago Nat in 1916. The team updates for 1915 and 1916 (like this one) are significantly more difficult than the 1914 versions for the same players.\nAndy",
