      "post_content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm new to the hobby and I'm looking for a few raw T206 cards as a starter set for me. My budget is about $60 give or take. I can go higher, but considering that I am a college student, my budget is really limited. However, if I get offered a really nice price and if you want a Bowman Chrome Justin Verlander XFractor Rookie Auto(graded), then I can do a trade+cash :)\n\n\nThanks a lot for reading!\nJohn",
