Card is in poor condition, front presents VG light crease, small paper disturbance, back has damage from scrapbook mounting. Can clearly see 150 Subjects... I picked this card up from a fellow board member just to hold the spot of a 150 type. Until I could find a better example (which I have). Reselling for exactly what I have into the card. Paypal no fee, check, money order....
