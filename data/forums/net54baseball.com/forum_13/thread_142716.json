I have a few HOFers with tougher backs for trade including Uzit. Here is a link to cards available, some will be tougher for me to trade than others. That said, not one is off limits for the right trade. [url]http://imageevent.com/mhgt/hoft206[/url]\nCards in both albums available.\n\nThanks\nMike\n\n[url]mhgt@embarqmail.com[/url]",
