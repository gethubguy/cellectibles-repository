We just got 150 cards back yesterday from SGC (Thanks Scott H for the quick service!)\nMostly T213-II (159 in stock, 70 to still to be keyed in), t216 Kotton (38, including 3 thin paper), T216 mino (6) D303 General baking (7) and D304 general baking (7)\n\nStill have lots of big names, also picked up some tough anonymous back T207 cards, all in lesser grade.\n\nYou can visit up and take a look, with the exception of the T213-II, all cards are listed with images, and the rest of the hall of fame T213-II will be up shortly.\n\nHere are a few images of cards that we have:\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/328/64588.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/328/64620.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/876/122544.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/810/119213.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/875/122507.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/875/122517.jpg[/IMG]\n\nYou can get to all of these cards and more using the links on our [url]https://www.gfg.com/baseball/tobacco.shtml[/url]Tobacco page!\n\nOr, just send us email, or call.

You have great cards, but it's a real pita wading through all the *SOLD* markers.  Maybe *SOLD* should be a set of 'past items' pages.",
