      "post_content": "Hi guys,\nI've decided to go with all SGC slabs. Instead of cracking this out of the case and sending it in I wanted to see if anyone wanted to trade for an HOF in a SGC holder??? Please only cards with the same eye appeal!!! Sharp corners and great color! This is one of the best looking 2s I've seen. It has some light paper residue on the top and bottom of the back (see scan) I might also consider higher grades (SGC) of N.Y. Nat'l or even selling if I can't find a good trade. \n\nThanks,\n\nReg",
