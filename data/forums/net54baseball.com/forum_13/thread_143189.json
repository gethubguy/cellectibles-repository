      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nHere are a dozen T3s from my recent find that I will sell raw.  These would probably grade PSA-1 or 2 (at best), so thought it best to save the grading fees.  These are guaranteed authentic and unaltered.  No trimming either.\n\nSeveral people mentioned a chance to pick up some T3s that are visually appealing but technically lower grade.  Best of all inexpensive.  Here you go!\n\nHappy to send front and back scans on any or all.\n\n 7. Camnitz - creasing, writing on back, great colors and corners - SOLD\n10. Devlin - 2 tiny pinholes otherwise VGEX, no creases -SOLD\n17. Griffith - horiz creases, o/w VGEX+ and clean HOFer -SOLD\n24. Mitchell - diagonal creases o/w EX -SOLD\n25. McIntyre-Det - creases, indentation, nice colors - SOLD\n28. McIntyre -B&C - small paper loss & stain, o/w VGEX - SOLD\n32. Overall - diagonal crease o/w VGEX+ and clean - SOLD\n41. Wiltse - MK f & b o/w nice VG+ SOLD\n46. Safe at Third - horiz creases, MK back o/w EX - SOLD\n48. Murray - horiz creasing o/w EX nice hard card - SOLD\n105. Lobert - vertical crease o/w EX, ad-back -SOLD\n110. McBride - tiny notch at top, tiny creases o/w EX - SOLD\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions.

I actually had two collectors contact me literally minutes after posting my list and bought the majority of the cards, including the two  you asked about.  That was very late last night and by this morning there were dozens of emails and PMs to respond to. I neglected to update the SOLD notes on the BST until I could respond to the emails.  Sorry about that.  I have several other T3s available and will see if I can find you one of those two or any others you may be looking for.\n\nBest,\nCraig",
