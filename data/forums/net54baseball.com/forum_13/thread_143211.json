      "post_content": "I discovered a 1914 Grover Cleveland Alexander Sweet Caporal ad from The Saginaw Daily News. Where I discovered it was within my own vintage collection. Where I originally got it I have no clue. The entire page is 16\" x 22\" with the Alexander ad being 10\" x 10\". What is cool (in my view) is that since Alexander is not part of the t206 set there is still a link to Sweet Caporal Cigarettes. Here are the scans. I am asking 100.00. I don't list very often and hope it is OK to list this with the tobacco cards, but I am not sure so I will list it with memorabilla also. Feel free to ask any questions",
