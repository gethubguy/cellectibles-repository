      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nGood afternoon.  There was such a rush of emails and PMs over the last several days relating to the T3s for sale.  The first group of cards all sold very quickly and so I decided to offer several more.  I was planning to send most of these cards to PSA and then sell them.  They are nicer cards in general and will cost a bit more as well. \n\nAs noted, guaranteed authentic and unaltered.  No trimming either.\n\nPlease note that where I've noted writing, etc, these in general are very minor and don't take away from the overall beauty of the card.  PSA would need to give them an MK, but if not getting them graded, you may not care.\n\nHappy to send front and back scans.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific card that is not on this list, please ask.\n\nLastly, I currently have about 30 other PSA-graded T3s available for sale on my website - [url]www.t3turkeyred.com[/url] - please check them out.  The prices are outdated (a bit high and very much open to negotiation).\n\n\n2. Bergen - scribble of pencil on front border o/w VGEX  $250\n3. Leach - writing and scrapes on back o/w very nice EX $325\n8. Clarke - a bit of pencil on back  VG+ SOLD\n8. Clarke - nice card but a but out of register, no writing EX $1100\n14. Dooin - scribbles on front and back, o/w VGEX SOLD\n17. Griffith - nicer than first, lots of writing on back G-VG $300\n22. Krause - some creasing o/w looks EX  PSA-2.5  $200\n30. Mullin - some pencil but nice VGEX  $250\n32. Overall - writing on back o/w nice VGEX $250\n41. Wiltse - tiny marks on back  o/w nice VGEX $250\n43. Out at Third - some pencil on nameplate o/w very nice VGEX $275\n44. Trying to Catch Him - name underlined on back o/w clean VGEX $275\n49. A Close Play - some pencil marks ow/ nice VGEX+  $325\n96. Groom - light creasing  PSA-3 $275\n112. Paskert -Cin - small writing on front border o/w nice VGEX SOLD\n\nThanks very much,\nCraig",
