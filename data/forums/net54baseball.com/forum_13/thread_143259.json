I bought it from our good Net54 friend, Dan McKee, who said in the listing: \"Sharp card but may be trimmed on top border.  Has not been submitted for grading.\"\n\nI haven't measured it. You be the judge.\n\nOriginal eBay auction here, with scans:\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/280749963974[/url]\n\nSOLD SOLD SOLD\nCheck, money order, or PayPal.\n\nEmails have priority:\n[url]trae@t206.org[/url]\n\nThanks for looking :)",
