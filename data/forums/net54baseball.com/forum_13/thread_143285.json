      "post_content": "I have an antique violin that I will trade for a vintage card(s): 1880's German-made Maggini copy, with Jaeger case.  Beautiful inlay design in the back, new sound post and minor professional repairs done this Spring, sounds very nice, also, nice bow.  I have about $850 into the package.\n\nI'm interested in tobacco or caramel cards, building sets and beginning with major HOF'ers.  But I'm open to any cards, as the alternative is to put this on ebay and take my chances.\n\nMy interests are varied, as long as it's baseball-related and pre-war.",
