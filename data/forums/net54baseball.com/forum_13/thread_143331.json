      "post_content": "I'm now tripled up on the same card and looking for trade options on these two Molly Millers.  I'd love a straight swap to another SGC 40 Southern Leaguer but would entertain other options (including raw).  I'm 1/3 of the way into my set, so I still need many 40s.  Also always looking for double name miscuts.\n\nThe SGC card is better in my opinion (left corner crease visible).  The PSA card also has a left corner crease (lighter) and a wrinkle from top border to cap.\n\nSGC 40 - TRADE PENDING\nPSA 3 - AVAILABLE\n\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/millerPSA/web.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/millerSGC/web.jpg[/IMG]",
