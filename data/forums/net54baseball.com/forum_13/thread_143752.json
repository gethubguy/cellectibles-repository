      "post_content": "Looking to sell this card bottom card Bradley. $330 dlvd (firm). Bought it before I saw some more desirable Hindu's from the same seller (Mark). Decent back might trade for high grade '57 BB or work out a partial cash/trade. I'm also very flexible with trades so if you have any high grade 71s/75s or low grade 53 stars maybe we can work out some kind of deal although I would prefer to get some paypal cash. Thanks, Pat\n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/Poweflfrontbradley.jpg[/IMG][/url]\n\nBack is one on right without paperloss:\n\n[IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/HinduBacksPowellBradley.jpg[/IMG]",
