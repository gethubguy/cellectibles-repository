      "post_content": "Hello fellow Net54'ers,\nI'm currently in the market for a T206 Cobb (either Green Portrait or Bat On) with a Sweet Caporal back only (any district/factory is fine).\nPSA 3/4/5's or SGC 40/50/60's.\nNot really interested in qualifiers, marks or paper loss but would consider such if it doesn't take away too much from eye appeal since this would be added to my personal collection and displayed for my enjoyment along with my other T206 HoFers.\nCan pay immediately.\nI can also sweeten the deal with this W516-2-1 Ruth if it helps.\nPM's please and then we'll talk.\nThanks,\n-Chris.\n\n[IMG]http://i1216.photobucket.com/albums/dd378/christopherherman/b4dc9787.jpg[/IMG]",
