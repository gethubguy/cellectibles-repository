This card has been in my collection for 15 years and has just been graded by psa. It is well centered with a pied. 350 back and has fantastic color and borders. It is easily a $550 card, but i want to see how quickly net54 collectors respond to this, it is afterall the holiday season! The first responder gets it for only $450! 2 stips, it must be sold tonite and funds are by paypal gift only. Otherwise, it goes back to the market price of $550. Scans available, but first taker gets it..... Thanks for looking[/QUOTE]\n\nIs that yours in a PSA 4 holder that's also been sitting on ebay at $550?",
