To the best of my knowledge this is the only Barbeau BL350 possibly in existence since both the SGC and PSA pop reports list 0 examples for this combination.\n\nI am asking (sold) for this card, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Payment by Paypal only.\n\nPlease contact me with any questions.\n\n[url]mmw2161@aol.com[/url]\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\nJerry",
