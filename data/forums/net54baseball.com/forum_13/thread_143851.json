Note that the Delehanty truly is a borderline 40.  When my grades were first \"available\", I put all of the cards in a new set registry and this was initially a 40; when it shipped it was changed to a 30.\n\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/036/web.jpg?ver=13208784140001[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/110/web.jpg?ver=13208784140001[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/124/web.jpg?ver=13208784140001[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://gallery.me.com/kimsummers/100037/229/web.jpg?ver=13208784140001[/IMG]",
