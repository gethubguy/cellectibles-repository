There are a couple of wrinkles on the front, but they do not affect Cobb's face. The back is very nice, with all text legible. No glue stains or anything like that. I believe the card received a 2 because the gold border is a bit battered, and the corners are rounded. Otherwise, it's pretty awesome.\n\nAsking $615. Paypal gift, check or money order are all accepted. Price includes priority mail shipping with insurance. \n\nHere are scans.
