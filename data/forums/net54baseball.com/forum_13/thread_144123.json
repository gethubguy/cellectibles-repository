      "post_content": "1. Joe Kelley Sweet Caporal 350 factory 30, PSA 2.  Crease in upper right corner, another along the left side, but much lighter.  Back faded, typical for a PSA 2.\n\n$70 including shipping via PayPal.  PayPal gift or money owed discounted to $65.\n\n2. Clark Griffith Batting Old Mill factory 25, PSA 1.  Heavy creasing diagonally left upper to right lower.  Left edge roughed up.  Same with the back.  Surprisingly bright colors, the creasing is the real issue.  \n\n$50 including shipping via PayPal.  PayPal gift or money owed discounted to $45.\n\n* Also willing to entertain trades for either of these cards (or to buy if any lookers have ones available).  Looking for the following, must be PSA graded, willing to include cash to make the deal work.\n\nBill Burns\nJean Dubuc\nChick Gandil\nEd Cicotte\nHal Chase (white cap, trophy)\nAny PSA 1 - 3 HOFers with backs other than Piedmont, Old Mill, Sweet Cap, Polar Bear\n\nPlease e-mail via net54 or directly to [url]jeffmbarlow@gmail.com[/url].",
