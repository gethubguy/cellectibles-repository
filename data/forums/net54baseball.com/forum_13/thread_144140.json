I am posting some T205s I have for trade, don't have much other pre war. They are crease free and I would believe would grade pretty well. If you have anything from my list I would appreciate any help.\nThanks, Bob\n\n98 Coles, \n99 Collins, Eddie Philadelphia\n122b Demmit-St Louis,                           Yikes!!!!!\n143a J.

We are all not collecting crumudgeons and believe that it is better to collect than to abuse.\nI apparently made an error. I do not collect T205's and haven't ever really studied them. The 4 that I have have been in a box for a very long time and were given to me by a friend, He may or may not have known if they were real or not. He's dead so I can't ask him. Once it was pointed out to me that they were not real I pulled them off immediately.\nAnyway, I apologize if I offended anyone and you needn't worry about me doing that again.\n\nBob",
