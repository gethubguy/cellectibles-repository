Paypal gift preferred.\n\nAs you can see from the scans each of these T206's has it's own unique personality:\n\nMike Powers: significant paper loss on reverse (probably from scrapbook mounting)\nMickey Doolin: large tear from top left to his head\nSherry Magee: very dirty (tobacco) on front, blue color staining (transfer?) on back, crease left side\nDolly Gray: large crease on bottom, bent top left corner\nBuck Herzog: well, see for yourself....\n\nI'll take 50 bucks for the lot. PMs get priority in order received.\nInteresting trades always welcome. Show me what you got.\n-Chris.\n\n[URL=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2rnk3rs\"][IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2rnk3rs.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=1zc01sj\"][IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/1zc01sj.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
