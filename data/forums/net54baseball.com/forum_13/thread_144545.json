Behind Boston Nationals and NY Americans the two St. Louis cards are the next hardest cards in the set. \n\nIt is in poor condition. It is missing a corner. The front of the card has stains and a smudge. The back has glue residue and a piece of tape which appears to be holding a torn piece on. \n\nPlease email me at [url]smithvintagecards@gmail.com[/url] if interested.",
