Let me know if your looking for anything specific and if you have other variation cards.[/QUOTE]\n\nHi Cory,  I must confess - I don't really know the T205 market very well, but I have LOADS of them for sale at the moment: graded SGC and PSA HOF'ers, ML'ers, commons, and raw ones as well.  I've been putting a good assortment of PSA-graded on ebay, hoping to get a better feel for pricing - once this experiment is over, I'll start posting them for sale here.\n\nAs far as collecting them, I have all the ones that I want for now except for Collins (mouth open), and the extremely hard variations such as the Wilhelm, toughest Hoblitzell and the Matty 37-1.\n\nIf you have specific needs, please let me know and I'll work on getting those ready first.",

I haven't inventoried all my T205's yet, so I'll have to see if I have anything else.\n\nUnfortunately, I still don't have pricing info on any of the variations - slowly building a spreadsheet of pricing info, but completion is a long ways off.   \n\nExample - I had one board member tell me the Wallace, no cap, 1 line is worth $100-200.  On the other hand, someone else mentioned paying over $500 for a lesser grade example.  My arms are up in the air.",
