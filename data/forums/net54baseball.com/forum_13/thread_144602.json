      "post_content": "This is the last of my T205s.   It  has two very light creases which account for the grade.  Emails only to [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url], please.  The Raymond in the scan has been sold.\n\nI'm asking $250 in cash for the card, but am willing to listen to trade offers.  I would like any 1919 Zeenuts you might have to trade or a T207 of comparable scarcity and value or several lower priced cards.  Raw T207s are OK.  If you want to get goofy, I'd take 25 of your best, $10 T206s (nothing taped together, no major trimming, no pieces missing, minimal creases OK as is BD (as long as the front is presentable).  Or I'd be glad to take a couple of nice T206 American Beauty backs (slabbed).  I'd like a 1915 Cracker Jack Frank Smith because I love the pose!  \n\nYou see, I'm pretty open to just about anything. Send me an offer.  The worst I could do would be to say \"no.\"\n\nCash, of course, would allow me to purchase any of the things on the trade list above, but the price is non-negotiable.",
