      "post_content": "Hello collectors,\n\nI've made three of these posts and have been successful each time. I'm looking to pick up another signed T206 or T205 for Christmas. I'm not as concerned with the condition of the card as I am with the quality of the signature. If you have one available please do get in touch. I also have 3 signed T206's available for trade if you'd rather trade than sell: a Doyle, Leifield, and George McBride.\n\nIf you have a HOFer you'd be willing to part with other than Marquard I have Grover Cleveland Alexander and Roberto Clemente (both multi-signed balls but display as single signed sweetspot) signed baseballs that I would be willing to trade for your card. These baseball are JSA authenticated. Scans available upon request.\n\nE-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThanks!",
