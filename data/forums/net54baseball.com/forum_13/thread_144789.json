      "post_content": "CARD IS SOLD \n\nAbsolutely gorgeous SGC40 Bender no trees with super clean back.  The reason this card got graded a 3 is it looks like someone tried to rub off a tobacco stain on his leg and has a scuff that doesn't affect the appearance at all but cost a grade or more lower.  Great example of buy the card and not the grade. NO CREASES NO WRINKLES High End low grade.\n\nSOLD $145/ BEST OFFER dlvd SOLD \n\n\n[IMG]http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u284/JOHNNYHARMONICA/T206BenderPolarBear0001.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u284/JOHNNYHARMONICA/T206PolarBearBenderBACK0001.jpg[/IMG]",
