The card is graded SGC 20/1.5 fair. nice card for the grade in my opinion.  $35.00 first class shipping included for delivery.  See scans for exact condition. Card does have visible crazing on top center of card and is not creased, but with that said, the card is very clean.    Pay pal preferred.  e-mail me at [url]cubkmac32@aol.com[/url].\n\nThanks,\nKen",
