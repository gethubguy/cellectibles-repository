I am selling it only because I have a t205 of him that I prefer.\n\nThe card presents much better than a 2 and I spent the last minute trying to figure out why it was a 2. The corners show some wear and the back is o/c. I knew it must have a crease and I finally found it. It can be seen on the back going through the b and a in baseball, the 3 in 350 and the S in subjects. Honest to goodness I had to search for it by turning the card angles and it cannot be seen from the front. If I can't get $40 for it I will keep it.\n\nFree shipping and MERRY CHRISTMAS!\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=293&pictureid=5403[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=293&pictureid=5404[/IMG]",
