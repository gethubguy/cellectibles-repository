Originates from a recent Texas find by a member here which included a plethora of Hindu's. Great color on this one. $435 delivered. Paypal A-Okay with no added fee. Drop me an email if you like em'. \nThanks all, Tony\n\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/ruelbachhindufront-2.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/ruelbachhinduback.jpg[/IMG]",
