Primarily interested in big-name caramel HOF'ers (any E95 or E96 HOFer, sort of interested in E93, E98, or any Wagner, Cobb, Lajoie or Matty color caramel, some E90-1s such as Keeler and Young).  Also looking for T206 HOF portraits in VGEX or better, or tough variations.  Thanks! \n\nPlease send emails to lessdrama at gmail.com.  \n\n(left-click image to see huge scan)\n\nThe Russie was graded 'Authentic' (according to Legendary) due to back-coloring.  Other than that, it looks amazing - very clear picture for a Mayo.\n\n(The T206 Murphy has been sold)\n\n[URL=\"http://www.t206themonster.com/Cards/FORSALE/SMayo-Russie.jpeg\"][IMG]http://www.t206themonster.com/Cards/FORSALE/SMayo-RussieMed.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
