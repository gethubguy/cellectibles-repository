      "post_content": "These two are currently un-cataloged, so PSA or SGC will not recognize them yet (I tried), but Bob Lemke has submitted them for inclusion to the Standard Catalog, as you can see in his posts here:\n[url]http://boblemke.blogspot.com/2011/05/four-more-t206-error-listings.html[/url]\n[url]http://boblemke.blogspot.com/2011/05/two-t206-marquards-hit-with-errors.html[/url]\n\nAs we all know, his work was not included in the 2012 Edition, which is a bummer, but hopefully they'll be included next year. I can't guarantee that, of course, but if you have the patience to wait for them to be cataloged, there's likely money to be made. I'm tired of waiting, personally, and just want to move these at this point.\n\n[url]trae@t206.org[/url]\nEmails have priority.\nPay however you like.\nPostage included.\n\nBOTH CARDS SOLD\n\nOffers welcome.\n\n(Factory short, not trimmed, in my opinion)\n[img]http://co.llect.com/i/123011/b51C7.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://co.llect.com/i/123011/9aJQg.jpg[/img]",
