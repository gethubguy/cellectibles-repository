I do, however, like the BST board because when the high end collectors upgrade their collections, their downgrades become my upgrades!\n\nThis year, I hope to add an SGC 10 T206 of Kid Elberfeld - Washington - Portait and perhaps another SGC 10 of Ty Cobb.\n\nI am currently at 514 of 524.  It's a set I will never complete.\n\nI am also working on the following basketball sets:\n\n1948 Bowman - (Damn you, George Mikan!)\n1957 Topps - (Damn you, Bill Russell!)\n1961 Topps - (Damn you, Wilt Chamberlain!)\n\nI hope everyone has a good 2012!",
