This one has an Old Mill back.  It shouldn't be too tough, but it took me years to find one of these in grade while looking every week.\n\nPriced at $235\n\nSORRY, but the card has sold.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/?action=view&current=T206OMCollinsFront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/T206OMCollinsFront.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/?action=view&current=T206OMCollinsBack.jpg\"][IMG]http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss329/upperhandisforemost/Eddie%20Collins%20cards/T206OMCollinsBack.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
