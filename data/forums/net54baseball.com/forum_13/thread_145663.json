Since Marquard died in 1980 (age 93) he was one of the last T206 guys around and therefore he's one of the most common to find with an autograph.  \n\nHowever, he is a HOFer and any signed T206 is a mini treasure.  I would guess it's worth 350 -500 certainly somewhere near that ballpark.\n\nBest,\nScott",
