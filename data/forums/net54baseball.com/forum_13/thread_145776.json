      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nKnocked a couple off my list this week. Updated for your consideration... I have 1 to go.\n\nThey are:\n\nDoc Crandall (Portrait, no cap)\n\nWould like an odd back or two just to diversify my ad backs. Could use a Polar Bear and a Sovereign and wouldn't mind adding another Old Mill to my collection, but all backs will be considered. Like SGC, but raw or PSA is fine if they are the right card. Just looking for nice centering, minimal creasing and minimal paper loss, pretty cards, but not perfect. A stamp or mark on the back doesn't bother me. In grading terms, something that would fall in the SGC 40-60 range, but marks are ok.\n\nPM me if you got em\n\nCheers,\n\nJim",
