      "post_content": "Hello everyone.  I am looking for a T332 Helmar Stamp Fred Toney that has been graded by psa or sgc.  I am also looking for a ex-mt one that is not graded if a graded one is not for sale.  I have one with a small touch of paper loss on the front bottom that I can give to the seller in the deal if they need one to replace the one they have.  I am looking to find this for my Fred Toney collection. Please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] or through the board. Thanks\n\nTony",
