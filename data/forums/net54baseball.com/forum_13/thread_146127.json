That being said these Premiums are really, really scarce. I doubt Tony has any. The one I showed is in my collection, wouldn't be cheap (none of them are) but I am not necessarily married to it either. I do have some cards that I wouldn't consider selling but this isn't one of them..Even this one shown, in the condition it is in, would be north of $2500..best regards\n\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/pt200premiumlargest3rd.JPG[/IMG]",
