      "post_content": "Since I attempted to purchase the T206 Dahlen Boston from you, I've written a couple of times through the board and once directly from my email to yours.  Today I got a call from someone who has been trying to contact me for the better part of a week from a gmail account.  I have gotten nothing in the way of emails, so I attempted to email her. The email did not go through, even though my account shows it as delivered.  Anyone else having this problem?  It is embarassing to think someone might think I'm trying to stiff him on the sale when there are other problems.  \n\nEmail someone you know with a gmail account and let me know what happens.  I've never had trouble before. I use road runner for my internet service.\n\nThanks.",
