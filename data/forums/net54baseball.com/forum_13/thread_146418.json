If so, what is the premium for such cards?  I purchased this one in a halls nostalgia auction in the early 90's for around $30, unfortunately upon close examination it looks to be trimmed (ow would probably rate vg with no creases...\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\n\nThanks, \nDave\n\nPsif anyone is interested I would be happy to mail scans",

Another curiosity - the lowball quotes were from people who were interested in purchasing.  You can use that information as you will  :)",

I didn't and have no interest in the card despite your implication that I am trying to lowball the card away from the guy.  I certainly could be wrong on price but not by much.  A PSA 1.5 Apple Green Sovereign Crawford w/bat sold for $50 recently.  A PSA 2 went for $65. A trimmed card should go for less.  Just my thoughts.  Of course if is not trimmed (it sure looks very, very small though) then you're talking a $150 card.  At least given recent sales of PSA 3-4's.  All of this is easy to research and verify.\n\nAnd yes, quoted sales are all for Apple Green Sovereign's.",

Maybe that's why you thought there was an implication that you were low-balling, but the implication wasn't intended. \n\nIt's still daylight, so my offer still stands, but I would recommend the owner put it on ebay.  Because, as you noted, esoteric backs can sometimes slip by ebayers, I would have a $49 opening bid (or BIN) or a higher fixed price.  I'll bet you a nickel that someone takes a $49 BIN.\n\nYes, I agree with you that it looks very small.  I don't really get it, but I've seen a lot of short Sovereigns that had nothing wrong with them.  There are a lot of cards like that:  the Browne Washington variation almost always measures short.  It might be a good question for Tim Cathey - ask him if Sovereigns typically measure short.  Ted Z would also be a good source for such information.",
