But all have some staining on the back.  All things considered amazing eye-appeal for the grade (they are all T206 slabbed PSA2) - sorry a T205 sneaked past me.\n\nNow priced individually -- or impress me with a trade.\n\nCards are:\nBrown - washington variation - $190\nEvers - chicago batting - SOLD\nGriffith - bat on shoulder STUNNING CARD - $125\nLajoie - batting another STUNNING CARD! - SOLD\nTinker bat off shoulder - $135",
