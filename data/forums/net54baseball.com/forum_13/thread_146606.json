I do want each card to be recognizable and at least 95% intact. But if it's trimmed, creased, has writing on the back, torn, paper loss, etc, I'M INTERESTED. \n\nPlease send me a scan or group pic of the cards. Make me your best offer. I don't want $100 worth of cards. I don't want $300 worth of cards. Give me a solid deal on a large group of T206 and I'll send you a crisp money order for $200. If you can put a HOFer or two in there, you get priority. \n\nYou can PM or email [url]gredandforgerock@gmail.com[/url] (preferred). \n\nThanks guys.[/QUOTE]\n\nHoping you'll share what you ended up getting...this should be interesting!  Good luck...",
