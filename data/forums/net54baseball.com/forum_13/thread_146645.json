Given to me by my grandparents. They met him in Vegas.  Awesome provenance/story behind it too!  GUARANTEED TO PASS EACH AND EVERY AND ALL grading companies as authentic. GUARANTEED FOR LIFE. In perfect condition. If anyone is interested I'll post pics. Don't really want to sell it; probably just trade. T206 cards only. Thanks!!",
