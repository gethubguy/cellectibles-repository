I collect beater T206 and want to eventually add a Cobb to the lot but for as close to under $100 as I can get. \nThanks for any tips/advice.",

The most I have paid for a card so far is 35 dollars. I'm working on The Monster Budget Set :)   I paid one dollar for the top half of a Tommy Leach/Polar Bear  ....but I wouldn't expect a fraction of a Cobb for under 50 .",
