      "post_content": "Well here is the deal ! On a walkin to a friends store I was able to buy about 50 t202s. Thats the good news bad news is the condition is all over the place. from poor (taped together panels) to vg. Im not a  collector of these so here is a chance to maybe fill in some holes. Sorry no cobbs. But some stars a Mathewson/ Myers complete panel but stained +creased.(scan looks like its cut but it isnt) I would say none are trimmed just well worn. I have scanned all the cards about 7 to a page front and back.  Very hard to price these so I would rather that you guys make me an offer on them . For the sake of fairness Highest price will take it. I will consider if someone wants to make an offer on all of it. Great chance cut up the taped panels keep the others intact,its up to you!  If a small order 3.50 shipping  if larger I will cover it. Paypal gift is fine. Or other arangements. Email if intrested [url]asimeone@optonline.net[/url]. or pms. Sorry no trades. I will scan an individual card for you also and put it on here. Thanks Guys help me thin the herd! Sorry Guys It is what it is!",
