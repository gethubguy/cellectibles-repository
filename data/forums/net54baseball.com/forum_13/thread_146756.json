      "post_content": "Hello everyone.  I am trying to get some lower grade T210 series 6 winchester cards for my collection.  I am from winchester so I would like to put the team set together.  I currently have Fred Toney and Atwell, and I have a Winchester Hustlers team postcard.  I have had a few others in the past which I sold to fellow board members due to financial woes.  If anyone has any for sale please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  As always thank you for any help you can provide.\n\nTony",
