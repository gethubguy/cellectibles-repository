      "post_content": "An amazing high end SGC 50 for sale. No creases or wrinkles. The color saturation of the green background is superb and the focus is perfect. Borders are bright white. I originally bought this card in a PSA holder but I since had it crossed over to SGC. I'm including a PSA scan because it is the best scan I have. My scanner does not scan SGC slabs well at all. You will have a hard time finding another example with better eye appeal. Sorry for the rambling but it's hard to do this card justice. Thanks for looking. Asking $1,150.00\n\n[IMG]http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m52/DHack3/BB%20Cards/T206CyYoungPortPSA4.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m52/DHack3/BB%20Cards/T206YoungPort.jpg[/IMG]",

You send in an early grade PSA T206 and you're pretty much guaranteed to have at least 1 grade higher.",
