      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI am selling the pictured T217 1911 Mono Cigarettes card of Elmer Criger of LA.  This extremely tough-to-find card is graded an incredible SGC 60!  (Baby on the way and I just learned the cost of day care, so as much as I'd like to keep this one, I think it is time to re-prioritize!)\n\nOf the total 114 T217's which have been sent to SGC from the entire set, only 11 have received a grade of SGC 60, with only 4 from the entire set grading higher.  PSA has seen 29 total cards from the set, with only 3 getting as high as a PSA 4.  To tell you how hard it is to find T217s, I couldn't find another example of any graded T217 having sold in over a year!\n\nAs for the Criger itself, there have been only a total of 4 submitted to SGC and a lone PSA 1.  Of the 4 submitted to SGC, there is an A, a 10, a 40, and this 60, so it's the highest graded for the Criger example, and nearly the highest graded card in the entire T217 set!\n\nOK, enough about pop reports - the card has solid corners, and I'm guessing may have graded a bit higher if not for the slight diamond cut to the card.  The back is super clean as well with no issues.\n\nSOLD!!! for the card, which would include insured Priority shipping (signature confirmation and all that good stuff).  Send me a PM or email to scooter0729 at yahoo dot com.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
