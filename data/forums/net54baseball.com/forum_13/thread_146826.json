      "post_content": "Hello all -\nI have a T206 Lena Blackburne PSA 7 for sale for $650 (paypal gift or the equivalent).  This card is incredibly sharp - with a touch to the top and bottom right corners preventing an 8.  My scanner isn't so sharp with graded cards - but a beautiful perfectly solid 7.  \n\nAccording to PSA's Population Report there are 10 7's and 4 8's total for Blackburne - with this being the only graded 7 and highest 'T206 Sweet Caporal' example.  Definitely a tough high grade common.\n\nEmail at [url]vettejayk@aol.com[/url] if interest.\nThanks,\nJay",
