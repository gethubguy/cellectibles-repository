They are\n\nBresnahan - $30\nCoulson - $20\nFerry - $15\nFromme -$15\nStrunk - $25\n\nPostage and Delivery Confirmation are extra and will be approximately $3.00 for a padded mailer based on what I paid today to ship similar parcels.  If intersted please email me at [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url].  I am open to offers.\n\nGraded cards to follow including including a Weaver and other tough backs.",
