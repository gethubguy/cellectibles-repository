I can send scans if anyone has an interest in a possible trade.  The SGC 30 Mattys are extremely nice for the grade (they look better than the 40s).  \n\nMathewson Portrait SGC 30\nMathewson White Cap SGC 30\nWaddell Portrait SGC 30\nYoung bare hand SGC 40\nWalsh SGC 40\nKeeler portrait SGC 40\nJimmy Collins SGC 30 (Pied 350)\n\nI also have a Tinker Portrait SGC 40 EPDG back that I would trade, preferably for another Tinker portrait with a semi-tough back.\n\nThanks,\nDavid R",
