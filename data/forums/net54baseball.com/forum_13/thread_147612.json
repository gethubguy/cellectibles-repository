You will see that there is no paper loss or creasing...only some light staining and soft corners.\n\nSorry for the crappy SGC encapsulated scan (I will get a new scanner soon). See pre-grading scans below for better image of the card front and back.\n\nAsking SOLD.\n\nFirst to e-mail me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] and say \"I'll take it\" will be the new owner! PM's are acceptable.",
