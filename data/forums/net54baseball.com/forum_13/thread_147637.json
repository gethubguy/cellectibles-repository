I've never cracked out a graded card, and really don't want to ruin them.\n\nThat said, here are links to the 4 graded cards I'm speaking of.  If anyone is interested in a cash & trade deal, shoot me an email [richard@richardarmstrong.ca].\n\nThanks!\n\nRichard.\n\nPSA 5 Joe Kelley:\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_27_Kelley.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSGC 50 James McGinley\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_2_McGinley.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSGC 30 John Lush:\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_33_Lush.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSGC 40 Al Shaw:\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_83_Shaw.jpg[/IMG]",
