      "post_content": "Hello all,\nI purchased this T206 Cobb Bat Off Sweet Caporal 350 Subjects  Factory No.30 24 Dist. N.Y. PSA 1.5 a few months back from a fellow Net54er and now I'm ready to upgrade.\nNO LONGER AVAILABLE\nThis card has great eye appeal despite the top/bottom border issue and significant paper loss on the back. There is also a speck of paper loss on his chest. No wrinkles or creases.\nPM's get priority in order received.\nThanks for looking,\nChristopher\n\nP.S. I really am looking to upgrade --- so if anyone has this card in better condition (Sweet Cap back only) I would be willing to offer this card with a cash kicker.\n-C.\n\n[URL=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2rr5r9z\"][IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2rr5r9z.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
