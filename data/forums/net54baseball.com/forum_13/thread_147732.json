      "post_content": "I have about 1,000-1,500 (haven't inventoried yet) comics - a few '40s, a few more '50s, lots of '60s, some early '70s, almost all are superhero - that I was preparing to inventory and list on ebay.  This will be a huge headache, so if anyone has an interest, I would be up for doing some rather large trades.\n\nI'm primarily interested in VGEX or better T206's, variations and HOF'ers of other 'T' or 'E' cards, and pre-wwi photos.\n\nJust email me using the link below, along with your interests - I have some of most everything.  I'm trying to reserve the PM box for discussions that otherwise would get the typical ass-ripping that I'm trying to avoid.",

      "post_content": "Cory, I'm in Washington State.  They are mostly Superhero from the mid to late '60s.  Nothing super-valuable, as I sold most of those about ten years ago, but still some nice runs.  All the ones from '72 - '74 are in fantastic shape.  Previous years are generally well-read.  Other than a near-complete Conan set and quite a few Sgt. Fury, all are super-hero (just about every title you can imagine).\n\nThe older ones are not as nice of condition as the newer ones.  If you send your interests, I'll start putting together a list of what I have.  You can send your email through my website below.",
