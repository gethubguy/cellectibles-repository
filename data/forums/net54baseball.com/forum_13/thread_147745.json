I am trying to stay around VG or better for the common backs.  I am taking what I can get for the tougher backs.\n\nAnyhow, the only pose I am missing is Abbaticchio blue sleeves (and a pesky shortstop).  So, if anyone has one they are willing to part with, shoot me a PM or an email with a scan or description and a price.  Thanks.\n\n[url]http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y64/JeffAlbertson/T206/[/url]",
