I have them listed in order of my preference:\n\nT205:\nBris Lord\n\nT206:\nMike Powers\nSimon Nichols (either pose)\nHarry Krause (pitching)\nRube Oldring (batting)\nHarry Davis (H. Davis)\nDanny Murphy (horizontal)\n\nIf you don't have any of these, but want the Murray, I might be willing to take any Phillies common instead.\n\nIf you are interested, please email me at [url]brentpsujmc@hotmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks!\nBrent",
