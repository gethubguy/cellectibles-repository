No creases, but does have some slight faint indentation on the bottom border and right corner. As an FYI: this card was slightly soaked in water to remove a little bit of scrapbook residue on the back (paper was in the upper part of the card).  Paypal, check, money order all work for me. Thanks for looking.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=57926&d=1330455703[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=57927&d=1330455714[/IMG]\n\nLovely Day...",
