I have a collection of T206's and willing to trade your stamped back for one of my clean back T206's + a little diffence in price of course. If you have a SL and I have the same we may be able to haggle. Willing to buy the cards out right also. I know some board members have some and there are others out there. I plan on tracking down a relative and donating them for their family history. Thanks for looking. Joe",
