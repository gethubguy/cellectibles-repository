      "post_content": "OK, maybe not the BIGGEST mistake, but in my mind pretty close. Long story short-my very first vintage card was a t206 cobb bat on shoulder BVG 2. I sold it on ebay in 2004 when I got out of collecting, presumably for good. Well as you all know, you never lose the \"bug\" and now I'm back collecting again. I'd love to track down this card as it has sentimental value to me. I've tried contacting the buyer via ebay, username dan33_12 to no avail. Either he doesn't check email or thinks I'm a freak and ignores the request. I can't reallyblame him, I'd probably think the same thing. I have no way of knowing if he still owns it or if it has changed hands a dozen times since then, or maybe even regraded with a different grading company. I just figured it would be worth a shot to put the word out to see if anyone has it. Needless to say I would pay quite well for it, even for info that led me to it. The serial # is 0002701284. It has a sweet caporal back. It is not the BVG 2.5 thats been on ebay for a long time. Thats my sad story. Maybe someone out there can give it a happy ending?",
