      "post_content": "I'm seeing some sites that list two different brown Hindu backs for T206s.  One regular and one \"Southern League Brown Hindu\".  I've never seen a brown Hindu on a SLer where the back is actually different from the normal brown Hindu.  With the Old Mill, there is certainly a difference.  Am I missing something here or is the fact that it's just on the back of a SL front make it one of these?",
