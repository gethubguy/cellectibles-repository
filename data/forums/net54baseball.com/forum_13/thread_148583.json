      "post_content": "I posted my T205 dupes a few days ago and had a few inquiries as to trades.....had not considered it beforehand as I would PREFER to sell them but mentioned that I would give it some thought....I would be willing to trade any of my graded T205's--most are PSA or SGC 4, 5 and 6---for any T206's of equal value, whether commons or HOF'ers....otherwise I would still be selling my T205's\n   If you would like a spreadsheet of my available T205's for sale OR for trade of T206's  please email me at [url]forazzurri1@aol.com[/url].  If you see from the spreadsheet that there are some that would help your collection, feel free to email any T206 graded ones you would like to trade (or purchase)\n\nthanks in advance \nBill Latzko",
