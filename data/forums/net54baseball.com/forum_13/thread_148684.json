      "post_content": "I have revised this post to be a for sale/for trade page.  Please look in my T206 Album.  Any card for sale will have a price (they are also available for trade).  Cards labeled as trade bait are only available for trade.  All other cards are not available at this time.\n\nMake offers!\n\nLink to album below...\n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/album.php?albumid=308[/url]\n\nFor trade I would be willing to take (in order of preference) a 1934 Lou Gehrig Goudey #37 (Lower grade of course), T206 NY Highlanders, M116's, T204's (I would like one for type), a C56 Hockey card (for my wife), or if you have something oddball (color preferred) then I would consider that also.\n\nMy preferred method of payment is PayPal Gift.  Please PM or email me with your requests.\n\nS/H is $2 per card (combined shipping available).\n\nI already have the following Highlanders:\nJack Knight (Portrait)\nJoe Lake (NY American)\nNeal Ball\nHal Chase (Pink Portrait)\nHal Chase (Blue Portrait)\nJeff Sweeney (NY American)\nRed Kleinow (NY American, w/bat)\nFrank La Porte\nRuss Ford\nKeeler (Portrait)",
