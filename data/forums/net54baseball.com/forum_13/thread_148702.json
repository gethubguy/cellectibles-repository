      "post_content": "I am looking to BUY many T206's I need with all backs OTHER THAN Piedmont or Sweet Cap and am offering very high buy prices...Have put together a spreadsheet of buying prices based on grade, common, HOF etc. Prefer PSA graded, minimum PSA 3 through PSA 6, but will consider SGC if very tough backs\n\nIf anyone has some they are looking to sell, please email me at [url]forazzurri1@aol.com[/url] and I will forward my \"buy price spreadsheet\" Prices are definitely reasonable and based on current high values\n\nThanks in advance \n\nBill Latzko",
