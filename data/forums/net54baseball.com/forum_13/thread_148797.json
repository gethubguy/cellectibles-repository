      "post_content": "Evening Folks,\n\nAm hoping to find a couple of C46 upgrades to achieve more uniformity among the condition of my C46 Toronto team set.  Was recently able to downgrade my Kelley, and am now hoping to upgrade Jordan & Delehanty.\n\nNo preference as far as graded vs raw, as long as they improve upon the ones I have.  Front condition is more important than back, too, if I have to pick one [as this is for a display].\n\nHere are scans of the cards I have, to compare.  Jordan would be fine if it wasn't for that paperloss, and Delehanty would be too if not for that massive crease across the front.\n\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_87_Jordan.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/C46_67_Delehanty.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPM, email or post to this thread.  Cash, cash & trade, or, if anyone is interested, I have a small lot of 1956 Topps [30-ish including Aaron & Spahn] that I could offer up as well.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.\n[url]richard@richardarmstrong.ca[/url]",
