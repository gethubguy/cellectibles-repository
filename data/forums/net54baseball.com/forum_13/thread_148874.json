      "post_content": "Here is a beautiful T3 Turkey Red of Johnny Evers.\n\nThis card has NOT been submitted for grading.  Having handled hundreds and hundreds of T3s, it appears to me that at some point, someone ran an eraser along the borders - no idea when or why.  I see no indentations signifying where writing of any kind may have been.  The card has NO creases, no damage to the picture and as you can see, it is clean, clear and focused.  The back is clean as well.  It measures properly, with minimal corner wear.  \n\nI am asking $550, shipped and insured.\n\nThanks,\nCraig\n\nMany more nice T3s available at [url]www.t3turkeyred.com[/url]",
