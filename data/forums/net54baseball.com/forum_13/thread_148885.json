      "post_content": "$725 shipped.  Check preferred but paypal ok too.\n\nWas in SGC 30 but I'd cracked it out and put it in my binder.  Looks like erased pencil writing on top back.  Looks like it said \"100\" or \"10D\" or something.  Otherwise a pretty clean example with soft corners.\n\nWilling to listen to trade offers.  Interested in a lot of things, but picky haha.  1914 CJs, M101-2 Cobb or Jackson, E121 Gertenrich, Deacon Phillippe stuff, partial trades fine too.  Will be at work (limited email access) today so if you don't hear from me till tonight don't fret.  I'll answer emails in the order received.\n\n[url]tiger8mush@yahoo.com[/url]\nRob\n:)",
