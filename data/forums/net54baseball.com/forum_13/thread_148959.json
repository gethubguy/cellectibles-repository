      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following T205 lot available. As you can see by the scans, all cards have had the backs completely skinned off and most have other serious condition issues as well.  Obviously some very low grade cards but a cheap way to cross a few off the checklist.  Please add $2 shipping for 1-2 cards. 3 or more ship for free. Payment via any method you prefer. Please e-mail me at [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] or send me a PM to reserve any cards or with questions. Thanks for looking!\n\nCARDS PICTURED---ALL CARDS $5 EACH:\n\nAustin\nDevlin **SOLD**\nDooin\nDoyle\nFerguson\nKonetchy\nKrause\nMagee\nMcIntire\nMurray **SOLD**\nQuinn\nSchlei **SOLD**\nShean\nSummers",
