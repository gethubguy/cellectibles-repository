      "post_content": "I am considering consignment of my T206 Eddie Plank to an upcoming auction.  If you would like to make me an offer before I do so, I will consider it.  I am not desperate to sell.  My collection just has a different focus today than where I was five years ago.  \n\nYou can listen to Lionel Carter talk to me about his Plank on my website.  You can also see letters that he wrote to me about his Plank there as well.\n\nIf you have any signed T206 cards that you would consider parting with, I will accept them as part of a trade/cash combination.  \n\nFeel free to make any offers to [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url].  All offers are welcome and will be considered.  If you want to email me and tell me I'm crazy for thinking about parting with this particular piece of hobby history, I'm happy to read those, too!\n\n[URL=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ocl_lDAo5RtqjvHjoDR7-EbbPrYp6YHrRqcN_cfzkkQ?feat=embedwebsite\"][IMG]https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-czKyXOXaHrk/TKyDhjQFlfI/AAAAAAAAJN8/f17c7FrtzzA/s800/Plank%2520SGC%252010.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
