      "post_content": "Hey guys,\n\nHave a few cards up for sale.  All prices include shipping.  I'll knock off a couple bucks if you buy more than 1.  I haven't really figured out this scanner, but if you'd like clearer scans, let me know and I will do my best.  Davis has a 4 small creases on the bottom left of the card.  2 of them can be seen on the back of the card, and 1 of them breaks the surface slightly and can be seen in the scan. Jennings has a crease on the bottom right which can be seen in the scan.  Also has a crease on the left side which can't be seen in the scan.  It goes from the left side by his armpit and runs to the bottom of the card at the \"J\".  Both creases can be seen on the reverse.  Collins has one crease which can be seen in the scan running from just above the \"A\" on his shirt to the right side of the card below his ear.  Bender's creases are evident in the scan.  A small one by his thigh and the one above his head.  PM me if you have any questions.  Paypal accepted.  Send as gift or you pay the fees. Thanks for looking.\n \n\nJennings (Old Mill)          - $71       SOLD\nDavis                           - $82       SOLD\nCollins   (Sovereign 350)  - $113     SOLD\nBender e90-1                - $46       SOLD",
