      "post_content": "Looking for almost any Hughie Jennings, that would be both cheap and suitable for framing.  In essence, an E90-1 or T206 or such, with terrible back damage, but a clean front.  I've been watching eBay for a few weeks, but not much has come up, other than some trimmed authentic cards, which would also be good, if at a fair price.\n\nPM me if you have something you'd be willing to part with.",
