But, as I assume you are a fellow UVA Wahoo, and seeing that you reside in the city of my birth, I'll do my best to help pick up your first Wash. player.  I do have a T222 WaJo that I plan to take to my grave with me.  I also happen to have a couple of George McBride T222s that are no longer part of the main focuses of my collection.  If a McBride card might interest you, kindly send me an email at [url]ekehl333@aol.com[/url], and I'll send you scans of my McBrides.\nVal Kehl (Wahoo class of 1965)\nGo 'Hoos - Crush the Hokies!!",
