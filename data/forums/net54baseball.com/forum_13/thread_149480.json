Was it the Doyle?[/QUOTE]\n\nI picked up nine of the lots (4, 9, 12, 14, 17, 20, 25, 23, 31), but paid pretty much retail price.  Only one of them went for under my max price. No bargains whatsoever.  Out of the 81 cards, only 35 are good enough to go to SGC, the best of which was a nice Bay (SL).\n\nThe Cobb did go for around $1100 as Andrew said... I think that was the highest price paid for any card or lot.  The \"rarest\" card was the Elberfeld that Andrew picked up (in the lot with a nice Hooker and Titus). \n\nI don't know how they organized the lots vs some of the singles.  The first single was Abbaticcio brown... at most a $15 card in the condition.  I believe it sold for $75.  I think that the VG Collins was the best single buy at around $130.\n\nThe funniest thing to me was listening to the \"coin guys\" joke about the fools there to buy cardboard after their two hour marathon.  This coming from guys paying $10 for a penny :D",

Thank God for Ebay and the BST.[/QUOTE]\nBy retail I'm referring to my perceived \"actual value\" of the cards with little to no room to make money on resale.  I agree with your assessment on the value of the common lots at $200.  In fact, the six lots of commons that I won averaged just under $200.  I wouldn't have gone another increment on any of them.\n\nI expected to be able to pick up some bargains, but that wasn't the case.  Some of the common lots went for double my max, and I think most of the singles went for at least two to three times my max.",
