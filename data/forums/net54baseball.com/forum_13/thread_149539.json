      "post_content": "I have a PSA 3 MC T206 Beck Broadleaf for trade. The name on this one is at the top. I would love to trade it for a Carolina Brights T206 of Frank Arellanes...there was an SGC 40 floating around the board a year or so ago. I would also trade it for pre-war Red Sox types and am open to other trade offers. Feel free to check my FS/FT album in my signature link to see my other cards for trade.\n                                          Thanks,\n                                            Steve",
