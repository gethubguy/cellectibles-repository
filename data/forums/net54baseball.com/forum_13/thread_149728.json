      "post_content": "For sale is a SGC 20 T222 Fatima and a raw T3 Turkey Red of Slim Sallee.  The main grade factor for the T222 is a missing corner.  Another corner is scuffed, and there are some very minor wrinkles/creases along the edge.  The T3 card has a wrinkle along the left side, and lower left corner.  There is also a wrinkle on along both right corners of the back.  Some chipping/discoloration along the edges is also visible.  I want to sell these as a pair.  I'm not looking to trade, but sell only; I'm slowly selling portions of my collection.  Asking price is $450 for the pair.  Please email [url]acowan19@gmail.com[/url] if you have any questions regarding these cards.  Thank you!\n\nScans may be seen here:\n\n[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/For%20Sale%20Net54/[/url]",
