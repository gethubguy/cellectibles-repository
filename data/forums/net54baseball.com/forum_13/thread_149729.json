Edges and surface are great with no creases or wrinkles that I can see.  The card was purchased from a friend and was already in the thick lucite holder with label.  The back of the holder has sticker residue which appears over the card.  I'm asking $200 for this card.  I only want to sell, so please, no trade offers.
