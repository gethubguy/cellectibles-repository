      "post_content": "Hi folks,\n\nNew poster on this forum.  I actively post on Sportscardforum and Hobbyinsider under the same username.  \n\nI won't say how. But I found a gentleman advertising A LOT of vintage 1909 and 1910 cards online. I found the gentleman, offered him cash, and now have well over one thousand cards, most of which are in very good (my terminology) condition.\n\nThere's no baseball cards. But there are track and field, boxing, military, animals, cowboys and indians, flags, etc. There is more stuff than I can wrap my brain around.\n\nI've cataloged the sets; and the list below is what I came up with (with the exception of a few randoms I can't pinpoint).  I know this forum is for sports cards --- so I bolded the sportscard sets below.  I think I got all of em!  \n\nIf you'd like to see scans and/or know how many I have from each set, just let me know. Any information you can provide is appreciated. Some scans are located here ---http://www.sportscardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1629399 . My apologies if you don't like links to other boards.  If it's a problem, I can add in scans here.\n\nI'm very excited about the find. And it has already generated some interest from a few prospective set buyers. \n\n1904 J3 Arm & Hammer Game Bird Series\n1909 T29 Animal Series\n1909 T59 Hustler Flags of all Nations\n1909 T59 Recruit Flags of all Nations No. 25, No. 593, No. 229, No. 240, No. 606\n1909 T59 Sweet Caporal Little Cigars\n1909 T81 Military Series\n1910 Duke of York\n1910 E3 Navy Caramels\n1910 Helmar Turkish Coat of Arms\n1910 Scrap Iron Black Back Flags of all Nations\n1910 Sub Rossa Types of Nations Series\n1910 T18 World's Greatest Explorers\n1910 T218 Hassan Athletes Series\n1910 T218 Mecca Athletes\n1910 T220 Mecca Athletes\n1910 T223 Athletes\n1910 T225 Prizefighter Series\n1910 T28 Milo Cigarettes Aeroplane\n1910 T59 Flags of All Nations\n1910 T59 Red Scrap Iron Flags of all Nations\n1910 T68 Heroes of History\n1910 T73 Hassan Indian Life in the 60s\n1910 T79 Military Series\n1910-11 T42 Sweet Caporale\n1911 T69 Historic Houses Series\n1920s Dockman Flag Chewing Gum\n1927 John Players and Sons Game Birds and Wild Fowl\n1935 Churchmans Rugby International\n1935 John Player and Sons Sea Fishes\n1936 John Player and Sons International Airlines\nOld Mill Bird Series\nRecruit Nations Series\nSweet Caporal Fish Series\nT113 Recruit Types of Nations Series\nT113 Types of Nations\nT230 Man Handle Scrap\nT30 Hassan Artic Scenes\nT39 Battleships - Burley Cubs and Sweet Briar\nT57 Turkish Trophies Fable Series\nT58 Piedmont Fish",
