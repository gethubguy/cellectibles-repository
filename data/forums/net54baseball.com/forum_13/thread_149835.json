      "post_content": "I've decided to start working on a back run of the T206 Fred Clarke Portrait.  I'm looking for very low grade, inexpensive examples.  The only damage that is a deal-breaker is extensive back damage.  At the moment, I am not interested in any card that would grade above a 1.  \nHere's what I still need:\n\nPied 150\nPied 350\nSC 150 fact. 25\nSC 150 fact. 30\nSC 350 fact. 30\nBrown Hindu\nOld Mill\n\nIf you have anything you'd like to sell, send me a scan and a price to [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url].  Thanks for looking and thanks to tedzan for giving me a list of all the backs that this card has.",
