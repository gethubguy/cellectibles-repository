I love the site and get a great amount of information from it.  \n\nI have some custom made Spalted Maple/Walnut boxes that fit approx. 40 BGS graded cards.  Therefore many more PSA should fit.  \n\n[IMG]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7263/7019159061_caf17f96e6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf there is any interest I can possibly make something totally custom as well.  Contact me if you have any questions.\n\n-Joel",
