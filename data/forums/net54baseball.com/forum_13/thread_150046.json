      "post_content": "-McGraw has a tiny scratch on the right side by his glove and one going from his ear to the top of the card (this one is barely noticeable).\n\n\n\n-The Chase is over-graded.  Not sure how it got above a 1.  The front is decent with 2 creases on the bottom half of the card.  The borders are a little \"off-white\" from years of being handled I would imagine.  The back has a little paper loss and a bit of some other paper stuck to it.\n\n\n\nMcGraw- $46 shipped\nChase- $26 shipped\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to PM me.\n\nPaypal gift, or you pay the fees if you prefer regular paypal.  Thanks for looking.",
