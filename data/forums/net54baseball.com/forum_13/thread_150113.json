It's in a PSA holder (Authentic Overprint) now.  \n\nThis is one of a very small group of printers' scrap with images from a vintage trade card for Lash's Bitters Laxative overprinted on the back.  In my opinion, this is best one of the group.    \n\nFeel free to PM me an offer if you're interested.  Thanks,\n\nDavid R",

      "post_content": "Yes, the scan Chris posted was mine from five or six years ago.  I originally owned all of these and have sold a few over the years to fund other card purchases, including the one Irish Denny posted on the BST.  My Dad bought them decades ago at a flea market in NJ or Pennsylvania, and never really thought much about them.  I think they most certainly all came from the same sheet.  I also have the vintage Lash's Bitters post card that is overprinted on the back of these, which I found on eBay a few years ago.  I think the printer used a scrap sheet with the Lash's post card to test the presses for a t206 run or mistakenly loaded a used sheet with the Lash's post card rather than a clean sheet when printing the t206s.",
