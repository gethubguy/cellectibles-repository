Goudey set created about the same time, maybe a little earlier, that was of scary-nice quality - the Feldman kid was roughing them up and selling them as old reprints, but they were being re-sold as real.  He offered to send me one for free, but I wouldn't give him my mailing address.\n\nIf anyone has examples from either of these two reprint sets, I would love to see them.",
