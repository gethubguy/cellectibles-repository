      "post_content": "Hey tobacco guys...I've decided to put my CJ's on hold to play in other pastures.  I started a T3 thread not too long ago and several responses, of which I guess I erased.  I am looking for any of the 8 Tigers found in this set in LOW GRADE.  I love raw cards (graded fine as well), pin holes are fine here but I do want to avoid missing pieces and writing.  No slabbed 3's or higher...they're just too nice and most 2's will probably be too nice for me.  Probably don't have the funds for the cobb but I am listening to offers.  I have psa 1 of t206 matty and t205 WaJo for possible trade as well.",
