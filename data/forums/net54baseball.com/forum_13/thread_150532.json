Card is graded technically a SGC 30 Good 2 but front looks SO much better w no creases that I can see and great l/r centering. Back does have some staining which is the likely reason for the lower grade---will send back scan if there is interest. $SOLD dlvd. PM if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/Wiltse.jpg[/IMG]",
