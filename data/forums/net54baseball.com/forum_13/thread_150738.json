These prices are relatively firm, my email address is [url]agonzdude@yahoo.com[/url].\n\n[IMG]http://img4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/img_3216.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://img4.sellersourcebook.com/users/113197/img_3218.jpg[/IMG]\n...$100... T206 Bernhard Old Mill *(this one displays a couple of small hairline creases on bottom right corner and a faint but moderate hairline crease in lower left corner.
