I am looking to trade one of these for Fletcher/Just Before the battle/Mathewson\n\nYou can take your pick which one you prefer. they are about equal though. The bottom has a bit of staining on the front, the top has a bit of staining on the back\n\nThanks :)\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=62764&d=1336248727[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=62765&d=1336248738[/IMG]",
