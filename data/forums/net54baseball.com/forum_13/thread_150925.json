A little interesting though how much less of a premium the Joss went for, if you think about it, I only paid 400 more for it than the commons. That gap for high graded commons and high graded mid tier HOFs is narrowing, or, I got an exceptional deal. \n\nEither way, stoked to have the Joss.\n\nThat was a really high quality Probstein sale though",
