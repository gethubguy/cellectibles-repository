      "post_content": "Pretty rough little lot but cheap enough. Includes a tough Southern Leaguer. Most cards have an issue or two...the Nattress has had some pencil writing removed, some back damage, the Kruger is trimmed (poorly) and a variety of problems..SOLD ppd. Paypal, PPGift, check, ok. would likely trade for a similar lot if there is a possibility I can upgrade a few of my worst beaters. At this time only selling as a lot, but may break up. \n\n[IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/sc00fce521.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/sc00fd4bde.jpg[/IMG]",
