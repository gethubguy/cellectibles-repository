I don't care much about condition as long as the card is Authentic and half way visible. Creases, marks, holes, trimming is all fine. Please email me at [url]bucklercards@yahoo.com[/url] with any for sale. I will also trade for cards I need. Thanks  :)\n\n(60) Al Burch (fielding)\n(110) Sam Crawford (batting)\n(115b) Bill Dahlen (Brooklyn)\n(127) Mike Donlin (fielding)\n(171) Russ Ford\n(202) J.R. Helm\n(225) James B.
