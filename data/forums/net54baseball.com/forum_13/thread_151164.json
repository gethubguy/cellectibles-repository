I haven't measured it, so am selling \"as is and described\"\n\n  pretty good corners and colors. Has \"Piedmont 150\" Back. T206 popular horizontal card. MUCH nicer looking in person, than scan.\n\nLooking for 27.00 incl shipping for this card. THANKS. PM if you want to reserve it. Scott\n\nCk/MO only on this. THANKS.",
