It's been a long month (working about 50 hours a week and taking summer classes). I apologize for not being more prompt. I honestly haven't logged on Net54 in weeks and I used to spend hours a day on it. When the first flurry of sales completed I purposefully let this thread fall while not considering the fact that other people could bump it. I believe that I have now responded to all PM's and emails, but if I have missed someone just let me know. I can understand if anyone is apprehensive about dealing with someone who takes two weeks to respond to a PM, but previous buyers can attest that you receive a DC# within one business day of payment and your card/cards within a timely matter. Sorry for the delay folks and sorry to Net54 for neglecting you.",
