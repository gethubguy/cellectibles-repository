      "post_content": "I'm looking to add my first T206 Cobb to my collection.  I would like to purchase on that is SGC50 (No PSA Please).  I might consider a SGC60.\nColoring and centering are important to me.  I don't care about the corners, as a matter of fact, I kind of like rounded corners.  I don't care about the back either and a Piedmont or Sweet Caporal is preferred.\n\nLet me know if you have any Cobbs available and your asking price.\n\nThank you for looking!\nPhil",
