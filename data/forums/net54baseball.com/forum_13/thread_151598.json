      "post_content": "This card is a bit out of place in my collection.\nI prefer ungraded cards, and most of my stuff is in the F-G range, though I have some better and worse.\nAnd that's what I'm looking for here, to trade this SGC50 for a poorer, ungraded Baker plus other card[s] that I need [see Want List below].  If you only have a Baker but not another that I need, I might take other cards that you might have, as I'm always looking to upgrade, or money.  But I'd much prefer to trade.\n\nWant List: \n\nEd Abbaticchio [blue sleeves],\nHerman Armbruster\nHarry Bay [SL]\nTed Breitenstein [SL]\nBill Carrigan\nDoc Casey\nFRANK CHANCE [portrait, red background]\nHal Chase [with trophy]\nHal Chase [pink background]\nTY COBB [bat off shoulder]\nCad Coles [SL]\nBill Cranston [SL]\nSAM CRAWFORD [throwing]\nBill Dahlen [Brooklyn]\nJoe Doyle [hands above head]\nBull Durham\nKid Elberfield [Washington, portrait]\nJOHNNY EVERS [portrait]\nJOHNNY EVERS [batting, Cubs on shirt]\nEd Foster [SL]\nChick Gandil\nBob Ganley\nBob Groom\nTom Guiheen [SL]\nJ. Ross Helm\nGordon Hickman[SL]\nBock Hooker [SL]\nHUGHIE JENNINGS [portrait] \nWALTER JOHNSON [portrait]\nDutch Jordan [SL]\nJames Lafitte [SL]\nTommy Leach [portrait]\nCarl Lundgren [Chicago]\nGeorge Manion [SL]\nJOHN MCGRAW [portrait, with cap]\nCarlton Molesworth [SL]\nOrval Overall [portrait]\nGeorge Paige [SL]\nEddie Phelps\nPhil Poland\nLarry Schlafy\nAdmiral Schlei [portrait]\nBoss Schmidt [throwing]\nFrank Smith [Chicago and Boston]\nDolly Stark [SL]\nGeorge Stovall [batting]\nJeff Sweeney\nFred Tenney\nWoodie Thornton [SL]\nJOE TINKER [portrait]\nJuan Viola [SL]\nRUBE WADDELL [portrait]\n\nBy the way, if you have any on my Want List that you're willing to buy/sell/trade, please let me know.  I have a couple dozen others, mostly ungraded, that I'll be posting in another thread later today.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug",
