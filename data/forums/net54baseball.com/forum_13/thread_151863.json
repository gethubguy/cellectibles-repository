I will only be taking offers if you ask my price you will not get a response back. Please send email with either Cycle or Pied 42 in description. Makes it wasy to catch in 100 junk mails:).  Let me know which you are interested in or both.  I will not break them apart unless you are paying a stupid price for one.  My email is [url]pup6913@hotmail.com[/url].  \n\nI will not be able to get you a list and scans till Saturday night or Sunday soonest. Please be patient. Have a lot going on right now.
