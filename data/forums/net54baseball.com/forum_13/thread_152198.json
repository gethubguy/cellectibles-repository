      "post_content": "I posted this over at the main board last week but will do it once here also: A few years ago I wrote a fairly popular book about coaching my son titled: \"Joy in Mudville: A Little League Memoir.\" It was hailed by USA Today and a bunch of other places and has been optioned by Tom Hanks for a movie. It does mention collecting cards but mainly traces my life as baseball fanatic, from a child onward (even playing with Bruce Springsteen). I have some extra hardback copies that I can autograph and send to you in trade for some kind of pre-1920s, or Goudey 1933,  graded card that you think might make a fair offer. So just let me know. Here is link for Amazon write-up and reviews (of the paperback edition). BTW, I've written a dozen other books but none are about baseball, although several cover various aspects of 20th century U.S. history. Thanks for reading this far. \n\n[url]http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Mudville-Little-League-Memoir/dp/B007PMCWMA[/url]",
