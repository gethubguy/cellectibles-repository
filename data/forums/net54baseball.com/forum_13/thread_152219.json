      "post_content": "I will be receiving 165 raw t206's in the next day or two, ALL  with Sovereign backs.(approx. 60 with Sov.150 and 10 with the Sovereign 460).     The front of the cards are vg-vg-ex but there is some paper loss on most all of the cards on the reverse.\n\n    As a reference , these have the same provenance as the ones sold recently on ebay by lharri, most selling for $20-$25.00;if interested, they can be seen under \"completed items\"  they were affixed to cardboard and acquired in the 1970's, and when removed from the cardboard, thus the paper loss.\n\n   I will be putting together an alphabetical spreadsheet by player as soon as I get these; prices will be in the $19.00 range.\n\n   In addition, I will also be getting in the same shipment 110+ T205's which have nice fronts (vg-ex/ex)and toning on the backs---probably in the similar price range.  \n\nIf anyone would like to \"pre-request\"!! the spreadsheet for either T205's or the T206's (or both), please email me at [url]forazzurri1@aol.com[/url] and I will forward as soon as spreadsheet is finished..\n\nBill Latzko   770 873 1181",
