Conditions of the fronts range from so-so to vg-ex, but all have paper loss on the back, resulting in the excellent prices. \n\n   For those who may have missed my post last week, and are interested in the spreadsheet of available cards, prices, and scans, please email me at [url]forazzurri1@aol.com[/url]\n\nThanks in advance \nBill Latzko  770 873 1181",
