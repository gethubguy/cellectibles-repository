This card is pretty scarce and the condition speaks for itself. A tiny bit of chipping on the front, white border is the cause for the low grade. I don't see any wrinkles or creases under a 6x and the back has one bottom corner with a small piece flipped up. It's only on one side though. Asking price  $975. You can post here, email me, PM me or whatever. I will deal with folks, in order, as they reach out to me. I will possibly post some more soon too. (probably add to this thread and just bump it when/if a card is added, instead of new threads :(  )\n\n\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/st2091armstrong.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/st2091armstrongb.jpg[/IMG]",
