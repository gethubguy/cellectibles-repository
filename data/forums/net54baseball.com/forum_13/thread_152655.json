      "post_content": "Hi All,\n\nUp for sale is a pretty nice T206 Zach Wheat.  See the scans for details on condition (note: I think the corner wear looks a little less in person than the scan portrays).  I should also note, the card is not perfectly flat.  It has a slight waviness to it. Not much, but wanted to mention it.\n\nLooking for $150.  Goes to the first person who says they'll take it for that price.\n\nCheers,\nPatrick",
