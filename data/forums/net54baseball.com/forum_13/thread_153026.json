      "post_content": "HELP!! I only need 16 cards to complete my low grade T206 set. I am looking for low to mid grade cards, preferably low grade. I don't care much about condition as long as the card is Authentic and half way visible. Creases, marks, holes, trimming is all fine. Please email me at [url]bucklercards@yahoo.com[/url] with any for sale. I will also trade for cards I need. Thanks for everyone's help so far. :)\n\n(60) Al Burch (fielding)\n(110) Sam Crawford (batting)\n(115b) Bill Dahlen (Brooklyn)\n156. Kid Elberfeld Fielding\n(202) J.R. Helm\n(225) James B.
