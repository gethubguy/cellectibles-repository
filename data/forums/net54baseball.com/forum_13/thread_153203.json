      "post_content": "I am kicking around the idea of trading this card for the chance at another Cubs subset.  I am not applying a value as with only 5 confirmed copies it will be worth what someone is willing to trade for it.  \n\nMy interests:\n\nAny grouping of Cubs from a T or E set.  I'm not overly concerned with grade but prefer no paperloss.  I also am fine with raw cards and do not apply any additional value to TPG cards.\n\nThis post won't remain for more then a few days so if you offer a trade you don't have to wait forever to get trumped.\n\nContact me at [url]esharpwork@gmail.com[/url] \n\nThanks,\n\nEric",
