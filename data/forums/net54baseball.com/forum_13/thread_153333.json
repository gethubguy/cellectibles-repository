Questionable if she will care or not, but its the thought that counts.  Looking for PSA4 (or in the vicinity).  Let me know what you've got.",

      "post_content": "Hi Josh,\nI have a Chappelle in SGC 50 and a Ganzel in PSA 4 that are duplicates, and can part with each for $55 (including shipping and PayPal fees).  I only have a scan of one of my Ganzel's, but if you're interested then I can find the other one, and provide you with a scan of the one I'm offering.  E-mail works best for me.\n\n[IMG]https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Rxm3HMCRxNw/Tkiehe2b-eI/AAAAAAAAMtM/2ym1jc3PjvQ/s640/T206%2520Chappelle%2520%25282%2529%2520-%2520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DFhP1tmSXjA/Tkiehjw13mI/AAAAAAAAMtc/unHv_-Wn-QI/s640/T206%2520Chappelle%2520%25282%2529%2520-%2520rear.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBest of luck,\n--S",
