      "post_content": "Oh, you mean smudges on cards don't count as rare variations?  Gotcha.  Well at any rate, here it is.  Many of you will recognize this card, a lot of the 09 Obak collectors have passed this one around the board the past decade.  I've upgraded my Martinke so I'll go ahead and throw it back out there. \n\nTo the Obak collector who doesn't have this one yet, you can fill a hole in your set cheap!  The drawback is, well, there's a slight trim on the card, barely noticeable...haha.  Not sure what to ask for this one, so I'll start at $20 delivered and work my way down.  Thanks for the interest!\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=67971&d=1341365831[/IMG]",
