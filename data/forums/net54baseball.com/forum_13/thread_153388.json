      "post_content": "Hey guys - \n\nI'm aiming to start putting together a set of the 34 financially attainable Phila Natl and Phila Amer T206 cards.\n\nRight now, I'm only 6 into those 34 cards so chances are good you have something that may interest me.  \n\nAs far as what I'll consider - Not picky on back type.  Beaters may be ok.  Folds/creases more acceptable than paper loss when in beater form.  Nicer raw also good, but, I'm not looking to break the bank on this set either.  If you do have slabbed, I'd only look for the Benders and Baker and even those still on the lower side of the scale.\n\nThanks already to Nate and Marc who started me on this trip.  \n\nMike",
