Looking for cards with nice centering, no worse then the ones pictured. If you have any and are interested in trading please PM me.\n\nThanks,\nStuart\n\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img229-Copy.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img229.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img230.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img215.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img220.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img216.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img218.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img219.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad202/rajah424/img217.jpg[/IMG]",
