They've lasted thru World Wars, depressions, recessions, kids playing with them and storing in their back pockets.  Seems to be too many that are EX or better shape with barely more than an edge nick.  Mother Nature wouldn't allow a card to stay so well preserved!\n\nNice cards Lee, good luck with the sale!\nRob\n:)",
