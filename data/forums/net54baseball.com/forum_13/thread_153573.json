It's a little bit over-graded in my book, probably closer to an SGC 20 but either way a respectable lower grade Shag card  which displays no obvious creases, just corner wear.  My sale price is.............................SALE PENDING..... (delivered).\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=68365&d=1341788044[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=68366&d=1341788060[/IMG]\n\n\nT206 Marquard PSA 2..........$75 (delivered)\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=68367&d=1341788071[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=68368&d=1341788080[/IMG]\n\nLovely Day...",
