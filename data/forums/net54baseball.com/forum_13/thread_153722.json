Payment can be made by check, money order or paypal gift. Please email me at  [URL=\"andrewhahn55@gmail.com\"]andrewhahn55@gmail.com[/URL] to reserve cards. I am also willing to trade for any T3's that you may not want since they are quite big and take up a lot of space. \n\nUPDATED CARDS AND PRICES AS OF 7/12 ----ALL cards in this thread are now sold",
