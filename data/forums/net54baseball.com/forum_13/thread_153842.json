      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI am selling a T206 Carolina Brights Hannifan for a friend of mine who doesn't do technology too well. It is a raw card that I would grade a solid VG. The price of the card is $525, which includes insured delivery. There are only three graded Carolina Brights Hannifan cards in the PSA registry. None grade higher than PSA 3 (VG). There are two PSA 3 cards and one PSA 2 card.\n\nYou can pay with PayPal or US Postal money order.\n\nYou can contact me through the board or directly at [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/prewar/picsb/06-197b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/prewar/picsb/06-197rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
