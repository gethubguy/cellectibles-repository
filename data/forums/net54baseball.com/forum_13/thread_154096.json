      "post_content": "Well, when I used to collect cards, this was one of three I really liked and kept, along w a Gorgeous SGC A Cracker Jack and an SGC 40 T201 Cicotte. But, time to sell, sadly, so I can put a bit in bank and do something till my new job starts soon\n\nI chose as the one to sell this T 204 RED MURRAY SGC 30\n\n I would like to get 100.00 for this Card, which includes shipping Priority/insured/Delivery confirmation. I checked ebay and that seems to be a fair price for a Ramly. Anyone who would like the card. PM ME TO RESERVE. THANK YOU. Scott.\n\n \n\nAlso, most of smudges u see are from a scanner bed that needs cleaning. holder is pretty clear. NICE CARD",

Myself and many other members don't care to do offers too often. Just a thought and good luck with it. (I am all set on Ramly types)....best regards",
