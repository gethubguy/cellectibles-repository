      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nIts my birthday tomorrow and I'd like to buy myself a nice present. I'm looking for a T5 Pinkerton cabinet (not the postcard) or a T215 Red Cross with nice eye appeal. I want to stay away from trimmed / stained examples. I've got a nice budget to play with. Please do PM me if you have a T5 or T215 for sale. I'd like to pick up a star or a lower tier HOFer.\n\nThanks guys. Feel free to PM.",
