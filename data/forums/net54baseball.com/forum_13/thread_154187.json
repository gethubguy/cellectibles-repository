      "post_content": "Offered here is a very nice colored silk of Parent Chicago Americans graded a 7 by GAI. It has the turkey red advertising on the bottom and is in near pefect condition. Of course a grade from GAI doesnt mean much but this silk is super nice as you can see. I cannot perdict what grade this would get from SGC as their grading on silks seems to be inconistent at best. Thanks for looking and if you are interested I am asking 150.00 delivered for this very high grade silk with no fraying on the top or bottom",
