      "post_content": "I have a T205 set for sale that I was asking $28,000 for, but I just had to come up with a huge 20% deposit for my son's first home (ouch!!) so I need to move some items for CASH. \n\nI will be at Booth 508P at this years' National Sports Collectors Convention in Baltimore from August 1-5.\n\nI would take the first $21,000 in CASH for this set. The stars alone are well worth that price. There is one card alone that exceeds $5,000 in the condition it is in.\n\nCome look at the set and the over 500 other T205, T206 and T207 cards that I have for sale.\n\nI am looking for CASH so let's strike a deal.\n\nI will be settin up on Tuesday, so dealers stop by.\n\nSteve",

I prefer to deal face to face on this one. But I will describe it better on Thursday.\n\nIt's a good deal at $21,000 -- I was originally looking for $28,000 and I have only done 3-5 shows since I purchased this set which I had lowered to $25,000. I have only done 1 show so far this year.\n\nI will be at the East Coast National too.\n\nSteve",

It was bought from an 87 year old who also has several T 206 sets -- which I have been trying to get him to sell to me - at least one. But he doesn't need the money right now.
