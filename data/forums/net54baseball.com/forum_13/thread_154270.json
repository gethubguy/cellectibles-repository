      "post_content": "Nelson, I hate to see you sell this card so cheap.\n\nI found this example to be very interesting because of the 'NY' pencilled on the front.  Demmitt actually went from New York to St. Louis, so seeing 'NY' on his jersey really makes no sense.  That was the original allure of it to me (Nelson acquired it from me).\n\nAny ideas as to why someone would have alluded to Demmitt's former team (New York) on this card?\n\n$700 is a steal.",
