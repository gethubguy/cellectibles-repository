      "post_content": "Hi all. I had tossed these up on Ebay but have been amazed by how many people have gotten in touch with me on this site about a separate group I listed recently, so I thought I would take a crack here and see who is interested. These are a few of my favorites (first and second place in all time E.R.A.) and they are both really well preserved. The Addie Joss Polar is especially amazing because it does not have a single drop of tobacco on it which is obviously rare for a Polar Bear. I recently saw an Emil Batch Polar Bear graded a 7 on Ebay, and sure enough there were still plenty of stains on both front and back, despite the grade. Anyways, I am looking for around $8500-$9000 for the trio. As always, and perhaps most important, exotic trades to be considered :) Thank you.\n\nWalsh- El Principe- PSA 6\nJoss-portrait-Sovereign 350- PSA 7\nJoss-pitching-Polar Bear- PSA 7",
