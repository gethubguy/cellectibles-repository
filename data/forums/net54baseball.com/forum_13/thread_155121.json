Double plays ARE separate.\n\nI know they all aren't Tobacco cards, but I'm pretty much giving you the others for huge %'s off with purchase of the T cards, so how does it hurt?\n\nMake offers via PM or e-mail (Username@Aol.com)\n$70 takes the entire lot shipped (I need exactly $70 - so gift or add 3%+$.30)\nPrice lowered $10 since Hall is a reprint\n\nThanks much,\n\nSean\n\n[IMG]http://i1122.photobucket.com/albums/l540/sean11251/IMG_0001-3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1122.photobucket.com/albums/l540/sean11251/IMG_0002-2.jpg[/IMG]",
