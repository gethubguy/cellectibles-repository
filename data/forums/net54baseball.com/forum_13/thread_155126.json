      "post_content": "I know the Bescher exists but so far i've never seen a Beck or Bender with a Sovereign back. I haven't seen the two with any of the Sweet Caporal backs either and that tends to be a pattern with some of the no print Sovereigns.  So far i'm showing 92 no print Sovereigns out of 221 cards which also don't have any Sweet Caporals either. This is just based on what i've seen so 92 is not a set in stone number since i'm still finding new front/back combinations at times.",
