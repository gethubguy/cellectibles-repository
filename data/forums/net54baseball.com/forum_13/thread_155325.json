      "post_content": "Over the past few months, I've moved away from collecting tobacco cards and have now decided to sell the last few that I have.  They are personal favorites, and the last to go.  If you are interested, email me at [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url].  Buyer is responsible for postage.\n\nT205 Wilhelm \"suffe ed\" card is definitely trimmed, but is uncreased and about the size of an American Beauty.  Shows very nicely.  $145\n\nT206 Steinfeldt portrait P150, creased, raw, probably a 10.  $18\n\nT206 Wilhelm, hands at chest, PSA2 $23\n\nT206 Merkle, SC350, card is heavily creased and might only be an AUTH, but has the partial factory 30 stamp in the lower gutter of th reverse.  $65\n\nN172 Van Haltren SGC AUTH.  Heavy crease across center of card and skinned.  Batting pose with bat cross body, head of bat almost to right border.  $100\n\nThese are now rock bottom, so prices are firm!\n\nI'm switching from a Dell to a MAC, so scans are tough. I can send photos if you're interested.",
