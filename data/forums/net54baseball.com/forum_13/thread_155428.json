Great eye appeal, none the less. $15\n\nGaspur/Clarke - hmmm. Gaspur's registration is a bit off and a couple of creases on the lower half. I'd give it a Good.  $20\n\nDougherty/Lord - the short print. 1/2\" separation in fold and light vertical crease. Great eye appeal and the separation cannot be seen (it's in a lucite holder). $30\n\n$3.00 s/h",
