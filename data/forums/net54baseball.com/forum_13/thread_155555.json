Signed T202's are extremely rare\nI might be willing to trade one of them for another signed pre war card I need (HOF only) or possibly a rare signed pre WW2 signed HOFer I need (I do not have a list of who I need).\nWill not sell. Send any serious trade offer to [url]theshleps@aol.com[/url].\nNo Marquards. Only signed cards or early signed exhibits",
