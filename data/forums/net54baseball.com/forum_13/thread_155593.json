      "post_content": "Hello,\nI'm looking to trade or sell this T206 Cy Young (bare hand shows).  It would probably technically grade as Fair due to the light pen marks on the back and light creases, but it does present pretty well for the grade.  The price is $250 delivered or I would gladly consider trades for another similarly valued HOF'er or tough type card I need from any pre-war sets.  I accept payment via any method you prefer.  Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase the card or with any trade offers or other questions.  Thanks for looking!",
