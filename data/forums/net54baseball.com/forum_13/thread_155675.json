I have a lot of duplicates I need to get traded. lol\n[url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/Texxxx/t206[/url]\nIf you have any PSA 4+ or SGC 50+ that I need I am very open to trades. Shoot me an email and I will send you a list of what I need. I will even trade for a 40 and upgrade it later if need be. Thanks Bruce\n[url]texxxx58@yahoo.com[/url]",
