I would prefer not to have significant creasing through the player's face.\n\nI can buy them outright or trade for them should you elect to.  My \"trade bait\" gallery can be seen by clicking my user name.  There are T206s in there for you T206 fiends.\n\nPlease PM me should you have anything available.  Thanks.  :)",
