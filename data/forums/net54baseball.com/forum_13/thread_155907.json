Looking to free up some cash for a few other pursuits.  Feel free to make an offer.  Prices include shipping, PayPal is preferred, and I'm heading to the PO tomorrow anyway, so the stuff will be out quickly.\n\nEmail (richard@richardarmstrong.ca), PM or post.\n\n\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.",
