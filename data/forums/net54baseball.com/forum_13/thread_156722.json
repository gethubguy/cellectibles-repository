A PSA 3 for $120 and a relatively-nice PSA 2 for $100, price includes delivery and paypal fees (I prefer to use paypal purchase as the safer / more accurate way to use paypal.)\n\n[IMG]https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m4Chf71mC9k/Tkiem354kGI/AAAAAAAAMwY/ZNIXzqaR2e8/s400/T206%2520Cicotte%2520%25282%2529%2520-%2520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EL1hdVYpCgI/TkienIX-S8I/AAAAAAAAMwg/NTAG9nxbgeI/s400/T206%2520Cicotte%2520%25282%2529%2520-%2520rear.jpg[/IMG] sticker on the back not mine, but rather from when I bought it.\n[IMG]https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gI6Lp2vctqU/Tkienho2NUI/AAAAAAAAMwo/s51RHUZ4WGM/s400/T206%2520Cicotte%2520%25283%2529%2520-%2520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fxSQ3BYEKNM/Tkien7aXnoI/AAAAAAAAMww/sc8O3ZRASrA/s400/T206%2520Cicotte%2520%25283%2529%2520-%2520rear.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLarger scans available on request; I just don't want to use up board space for them.  I just need to verify that they're both available (ie that I didn't sell one over the past year) -- and I'm currently away from home till the weekend.  But if you're interested, let me know and I'll check right away when I get home.\n\nThanks,\n--S",
