Working on it myself, but a little stuck on the more expensive HOFers.\n\nHave a duplicate Chase, blue portrait, in SGC 50 with Polar Bear back, as I've been working on a back run of his for a little while now.  Not really actively trying to sell, but figure I could part for $110 (including delivery and paypal fees).\n[IMG]https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UHJ873Pmxo4/Tkiej8adKLI/AAAAAAAAMus/LZXAFd3nVFw/s400/T206%2520Chase%2520%2528portrait%252C%2520blue%2529%2520-%2520front.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Gve139oG0lU/TkiekG2MMXI/AAAAAAAAMu4/zJtWQWF3q2Y/s400/T206%2520Chase%2520%2528portrait%252C%2520blue%2529%2520-%2520rear.jpg[/IMG]\n\nCan provide larger version of scans upon request.\n\nThanks,\n--S",
