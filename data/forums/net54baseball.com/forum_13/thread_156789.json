Since I already have a similar Perdue in my set, I was hoping to move this card, ideally in trade for one of the remaining Southern Leaguers that I need in similar condition or something else I'm looking for in my set.  The card has an Old Mill back and is definitely lower grade.  Below are scans of the Perdue.  I would also consider selling the card if you are interested as well.\n\n[URL=\"http://s1236.beta.photobucket.com/user/Idiottax/library/\"][IMG]http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff453/Idiottax/PerdueFront_zps19102347.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s1236.beta.photobucket.com/user/Idiottax/library/\"][IMG]http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff453/Idiottax/PerdueBack_zps17e76210.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nBelow are the cards I still need for my set.
