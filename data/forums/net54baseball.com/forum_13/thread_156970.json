I will be adding prices to the ones that are available for sale or trade.  If both are available there will be two prices.  If a card is listed as not available, feel free to make a ridiculous offer.  You never know.  The scans are completed, but the pricing info is incomplete at this time.  A veritable Super Market for your Monster.  I'll continue to post new scans weekly in this thread as well until we see how this album thing works.  My collector focus Tobacco Road collection will be maintained as well.\n\nThanks for looking.  Prices include shipping.  Paypal gift, check or money order accepted.",
