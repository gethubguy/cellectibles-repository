      "post_content": "How many of you have seen Old Mill and Hindu newspaper ads depicting the sale of tobacco with baseball cards...I'm sure quite a few. Now how many of you own the actual ads? Well I am looking to sell them. I have quite a few so if you are seriously interested in purchasing one or all of them then send me an email to [url]kilaartist@aol.com[/url] and I will send you the images.\n\nT206Museum.com has a few of these ads for sale online for between $180-$220 but they are cut out ads. I have full newspaper sheets for sale which would look great hanging up in your man cave or home. Hindu ads are larger then the Old Mill ads.\n\nThanks,\n\nDoug",

I wasn't able to get onto my old name so I had created a new one but after speaking with Leon, we figured out the glitch and I'm back as Brass23. \n\nSo as I said before if you are actually interested in the newspaper ads please email me at [url]kilaartist@aol.com[/url]. Thanks\n\nDoug",
