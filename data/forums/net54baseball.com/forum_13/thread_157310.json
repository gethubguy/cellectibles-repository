      "post_content": "UPDATE***\nAs requested I sent out emails to everyone that requested pictures of the ads. \nBoth full page Hindu ads have been sold as well as the full newspaper and one poster\n\nThe two Old Mill ads are still available and one poster\n\n\nHow many of you have seen Old Mill and Hindu newspaper ads depicting the sale of tobacco with baseball cards...I'm sure quite a few. Now how many of you own the actual ads? Well I am looking to sell them. I have quite a few so if you are seriously interested in purchasing one or all of them then send me an email to [url]kilaartist@aol.com[/url] and I will send you the images.\n\nT206Museum.com has a few of these ads for sale online for between $180-$220 but they are cut out ads. I have full newspaper sheets for sale which would look great hanging up in your man cave or home. Hindu ads are larger then the Old Mill ads.\n\nThanks,\n\nDoug\n\nPS: Member name used to be Colorado723 but changed it back to Brass23 with help from Leon. Thanks Leon",
