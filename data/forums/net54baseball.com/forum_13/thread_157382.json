As Andy noted, I would get it regraded by SGC, PSA or Beckett before you do anything else.  There's too many questions/issues with the \"off\" grading companies - too many instances of them coming back trimmed or altered (I had 3 CSA's in the past - all 3 came back altered).  I'm not saying yours is, I'm not a grader - but judging off the scans alone, given back centering and corners - I think you'd be looking at a 4 or 5 at best on a cross (if it doesn't come back altered/trimmed)",

I know others have had issues with Psa cards gettin into sgc holders. Probably at a higher rate based on the opinions on this board. However. Nearly all CSA cards are in those holders because they will not get into numbered Psa or sgc holders.",

      "post_content": "I'm sure there are others on this board who will agree you made the right choice with SGC Graded mid-50's Mantles.  If you are buying those cards I agree.  You can get the same grade cards in SGC holders for much less than for the same grade card in a PSA holder (approx 25% less for SGC than PSA in higher grades).  If you are looking to hold onto the cards and enjoy them then I also agree that SGC is the way to go.  The SGC cases are much more durable and attractive than PSA holders.  However if you are getting raw high grade 1950's cards graded to sell them then I think you made a mistake.  You are leaving money on the table by selling high grade 1950's in SGC holders (the PSA registry has a powerful influence on Supply & Demand).  Many here will also tell you that PSA is likely to screw up the grade and overgrade the cards.  They apparently are also likely to find non-existent trim in an attempt to get you to pay to have the card graded a 2nd and 3rd time.  I am not going to fight the SGC vs PSA battle here.  My point is that VCP will quickly show that high grade PSA cards sell for more than high grade SGC cards in that era.  For lower grade cards there are no price differences.",
