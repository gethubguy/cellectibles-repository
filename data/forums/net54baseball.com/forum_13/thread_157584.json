      "post_content": "Up for sale is a nice, beater t206 Harry Covaleski card. Card is perfect for anyone that needs to add some cards to their set. Card has an awesome wet sheet transfer on the back, so you can see the red outline of part of the player on the back. Card does have paperloss on the back and does appear to be trimmed. HAS GREAT EYE APPEAL! Would like to get $15, but open to offers and trades. Please PM me. Thank you.\n\nPlease allow $2 for shipping",
