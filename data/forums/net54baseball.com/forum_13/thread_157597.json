      "post_content": "Hey Everyone Thanks for purchasing the Hindu Ads that I had up for sale.\n\nI currently have 3 Old Mill ads for sale and one poster depicting a newspaper ad with Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Eddie Plank. The ads are full page ads and I can send scans of them if you email me at [url]kilaartist@aol.com[/url]. I accept Paypal and Postal money Order.\n\nI am asking $55 a piece for the Old Mill Ads and $25 for the poster. T206 Museum has Old Mill ads which are cut outs for $220. They are a great addition to anyone T206 memorabilia collection or guy room. You don't come across them that often.\n\nThe Old Mill Ads are as follows:\n\nThe Augusta Herald, Augusta, GA 1910 - Man on a horse taking a cigarette from a helper\n\nThe Constitution, Atlanta, GA Wednesday May 18 1910 - Man and woman playing tennis\n\nThe Augusta Herald, Augusta, GA Tuesday April 12, 1910 - Two men at a horse race smoking\n\nThe poster is of The North American, Philadelphia Sunday, May 19, 1912 depicting Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson in an advertisement for Hassan Cork Tip Cigarettes (or T202 Hassan Triple Folders) with a story on Eddie Plank with multiple photos below. This ad has color.\n\nWorth the look!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDoug",
