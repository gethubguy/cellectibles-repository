Hofman was the guy that fielded Merkle's infamous hit, then overthrew Evers before the Cubs eventually got the force at second base.  The card is in pretty decent shape, and I'll even throw in the hole for free so you can wear it as a necklace!\n\nTake Care,\nGeno\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/T206HofmanFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/T206HofmanBack.jpg[/IMG]",
