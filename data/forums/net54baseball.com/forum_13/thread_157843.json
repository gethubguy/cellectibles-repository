      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI've just started the process of breaking up a very nice low-mid grade T3 Turkey Red set.  Most of the cards are ungraded - so nice to hold them before they are sent off to be slabbed.  I'm only beginning to scan and price them, but if you are looking for a specific card or cards, or cards in a specific grade, please contact me and I'll get to work for you right away.  This is really a \"collector grade\" set and will be priced accordingly.  This is a perfect chance to pick up your first T3, fill a hole in your set or get a key Hall of Famer.  There are some very nice cards in the group as well and some will be sent to PSA for grading - unless you want to grab them first.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks in advance for your patience, I am scanning as fast as I can.\n\nHappy Collecting,\nCraig",
