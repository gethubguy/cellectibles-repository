      "post_content": "Hello,\nThought it would be best to start a new thread.  Thank you for everyone who has contacted me about the cards.  I've been emailing and scanning like crazy and am not yet finished.  Anyway, here is the list.\n\nA note about grading:  Unless specifically stated, these cards are ungraded.  If the card has a pinhole, I have noted it and then given it a grade irrespective of the pinhole - but still priced it as a pinholed card.  Otherwise, these are my estimates of what a tpg would grade them.  I can't guarantee a grade.  Maybe they should be kept raw!  However, please know that I have submitted well over 500 T3s for grading.  \n\nOverall, these cards are quite nice.  They seem to suffer most from rounded corners, but have clean backs, bright, beautiful fronts, and best of all, so many are crease-free.  \n\nIf you want a scan, please give me your email address and I will send 'em over promptly.  Thank you very much for looking and I hope you find something you like.  Feel free to ask any questions, I enjoy talking turkey.\n\n2. Bergen - vgex $275\n3. Leach - vg w/ph $125\n4.
