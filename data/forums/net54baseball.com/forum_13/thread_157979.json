According to The Ballplayers, he roomed with Waddell and had it written into Rube's contract that he wouldn't eat crackers in bed!\n\nIf you're interested in Ossee for a similar condition Sovereign T205 or T206, let me know!  He's got a Factory 25/350 back.\n\nTake Care,\nGeno\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/T206SchreckFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r181/HercDriver_photo/T206SchreckBack.jpg[/IMG]",
