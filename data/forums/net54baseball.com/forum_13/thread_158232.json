I can't even find a picture of it on google images.\n\nCan someone please confirm this front back combo exists and rank in on your grades. I'm trying to assess the feasibility of getting this card in 5 or better\n\nIf you have it would you consider trading a different backed card?\n\nThanks\nKevin",
