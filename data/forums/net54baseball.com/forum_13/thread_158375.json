      "post_content": "Well here goes.  I have had many people ask about my Carolina Brights T206 cards and after a little thought and research I am going to throw this out here and see how it goes.  \n\nWhat's my crazy number some of you may have asked?  How about these 11 T206's for $10,000.  From what I've seen and what has been graded by PSA, this has to be one of the better Carolina Bright collections around.  This would be a real nice addition to anyone's collection.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my buy it now and end the drama price for me.  I'll let it go out there for a bit.  I really don't want to sell them but I figure I can give it a go.\n\nThis lot includes:\n\nBill Abstein PSA 4  1 of 2 graded by PSA both 4's\nBill Clymer PSA 3.5 1 of 4 graded by PSA 2nd highest\nFred Burchell PSA 3 1 of 4 graded by PSA \nJap Barbeau PSA 3 1 of 4 graded by PSA\nJean Dubuc PSA 3 1 of 2 the highest graded by PSA\nBilly Nattess PSA 3 1 of 1 \nPaul Davidson PSA 2 1 of 2 higest graded by PSA\nDeacon Phillippe PSA 2 1 of 2 graded by PSA\nTom Downey PSA 2 1 of 1 graded by PSA\nRed Murray PSA 1.5 1 of 1 graded by PSA\nBilly Campbell PSA 1 1 of 3 graded by PSA\n\nShoot me a PM if you're interested.\n\nThanks\n\nA",
