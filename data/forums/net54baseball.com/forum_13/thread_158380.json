      "post_content": "Back in early September, Mark DelPercio was kind enough to post the backscan of my T206 Chappelle which had an obvious discolored area on the back. Neither of us knew, at the time, whether the discoloration was a wet print transfer, a ghost image or scrap.  The only thing we were certain of was that it was not color bleed from the front of the card. \n\nAfter posting the scan and soliciting feedback, we were able to determine that the image on the back of the card was that of a T206 Ganzel and that most likely it was a wet sheet transfer. I no longer collect T-cards, and Mark indicated he wasn't particularly interested in it as print errors, mistakes, etc., aren't high on his want list.  I want to sell the card but don't know what a fair price might be.  I know wet sheet transfers of the backs are somewhat common, but the transfer of another player to the back of the card of another player is not that common.  The card is graded/slabbed SGC30.\n\nSooo ... Here I am again. I am willing to sell or trade it.  I will take cards from either of two vintage football sets I'm collecting, or a fair cash offer.  Email me at [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url] with your offer.  If you'd like to see the card, it's in Mark's post of September 9.",
