      "post_content": "Guys.........Hello. I recently purchased a small lot of mostly t206 commons (1 HOF) from a local estate that were in storage for many years. These remaining cards are clean from writing and pin holes, but a few have some lighter staining (as noted). I don't see any with trimming issues. ALL GRADES ARE MY PERSONAL OPINION. Please PM me here or email me at mattpienta at yahoo dot com with questions or to purchase. Shipping is $3 for as many cards as you'd like to buy. Preferred payment via Paypal 'gift', but USPS money orders ok, too. Personal checks require 7 days to clear before shipment. US shipping only. Thanks.....Matt\n\nPS......I've rescanned these 11 remaining cards with price adjustments from before.\n\n\nt206 Joss portrait...VG-EX, no creases, good centering, corner wear, SC 150 back......*SOLD*\nt206 Congalton...G, crease, good color & centering, SC350 back...*SOLD*\nt206 Criss...F, no creases, good color, miscut front, SC150 back....*SOLD*\nt206 Downey fielding...P, creases, corner wear, SC350 back....*SOLD*\nt206 Hoffman...G, crease, corner wear, good centering, SC350 back...*SOLD*\nt206 Howard...G, good color & centering, creases & corner wear, Sovereign 350 back....*SOLD*\nt206 Krause throwing...G, staining across top of front & back, good color, crease, Sovereign 350 back....*SOLD*\nt206 Liebhardt...P, no creases, heavier front and back staining, good color & centering, SC 150 Overprint back....*SOLD*\nt206 Oldring...VG, no creases, corner wear, good color & centering, LR corner stain (heavier on back), SC 350-460 back....*SOLD*\nt206 Perring...VG-EX (w/ note to staining), no creases, good color & centering, light lower front & back staining, Sovereign 350 back...*SOLD*\nt206 Stephens...G-VG, good color & centering, corner wear, corner crease, o/c back, Sovereign 350 back...*SOLD*",
