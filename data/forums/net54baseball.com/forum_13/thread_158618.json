      "post_content": "It is my birthday, and I got outbid on the big ticket items in some recent auctions.  After giving a substantial donation to the red cross, I'm looking to get myself a birthday gift.  I'd be interested in T205 HOFers in psa 4-5, a T227 Baker or Bender psa 2-3, a nice T206 Jennings (portrait or two hands) or Clarke (batting), a T3 Clarke or Bender psa 3-4, or a T206 Cobb (any) at a 3-4 (and reasonably priced).  I'd be happy to take a similar SGC grade on any of the above.  Would also be interested in any autographed pre-war.  Email me at [url]joshmargolin@gmail.com[/url] with what you have for sale and your asking price.  If you want me to make the first offer on your card(s), you can save us both the email.  Thanks all, and I hope you all get out and vote today.",
