Back has an extremely light stamp that is to light to be legible and does not detract from eye appeal of card.  SOLD for a new home.\n\nShipping is on me, insurance is optional and on you.  References available upon request, pp gift preferred but will take almost any form of payment.  Thanks for looking.",
