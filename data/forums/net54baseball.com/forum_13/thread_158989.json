I would also consider a '55 Koufax or Clemente in similar condition.  \n\nI'm not looking to sell or trade for other cards right now.  I'm just trying to complete a couple of '50s sets and thought I would use these as trade bait.  \n\n[url]http://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/#!cpZZ1QQtppZZ20[/url]",
