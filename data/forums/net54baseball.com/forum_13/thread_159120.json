The Wiltse and Karger are tougher commons and you also get Big Ass Herzog, Kling, Pelty, Covaleski, a double name Konetchy and the Jones appears to have been bleached or something.  \n\nThere are a few decent cards in here but most are true beaters.  Great fillers for the poor mans Monster set.  \n\nI'm too busy to piece these out which is why I'm selling so cheap. \n\nThanks!\n\nEric",
