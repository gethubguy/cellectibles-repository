      "post_content": "I'm excited to see all the buzz about the best baseball card set of all-time (no not 1987 Topps;)) \n\nT205!\n\nIt's caused me to go through my set and look at the backs, read the bios (try that on T206;))\nOk, I even started logging the factory designations on my spreadsheet.\n\nBut the real point of this post is to acquire some more of these. I have one full set, but I need upgrades, a second set and/or even rarer backs someday, so why not start now...\nI ONLY want SGC graded cards, looking for grades 30-60 for now, although I would consider higher or lower if the price is right...or if the back is an upgrade to what I have already.\nI'll begin the begging looking for the commons I'd like to upgrade...all listed below. Send me what you have for sale, and we'll try to come up with something.\n\nArcher\nAustin\nBergen\nCorridon\nEngle\nEwing\nFlynn\nGardner\nHauser\nJacklitsch\nLaPorte\nLeach\nMaddox\nMagee\nMcBride\nMeyers\nMurray\nOverall\nPaskert\nPhelps\nSchmidt\nSimmons\nSteinfeldt",

Mine isn't slabbed yet and when it gets graded, it might be lower than the one you offered...can you send a scan so I can compare? If it looks nice, we can likely swing a deal!\n\nfamilytoad at comcast dot net is my email address...Thanks for writing Mike!!!!",
