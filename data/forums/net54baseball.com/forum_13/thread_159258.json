      "post_content": "Picked up a couple of minor freaks over the past few months and it's time to find them new homes.  Prices include delivery, paypal preferred.\n\n[S]Arndt (print line on back) - $75[/S] SOLD\n[S]Atz (miscut back) - $40[/S] SOLD\nDonlin Seated (miscut back, very poor condition) - $20\n[S]Helm (color variation?) - $100[/S]  SOLD\nRandall (miscut, frame on bottom of front) - $30\nSheckard No Glove (ghost of name \"M. Brown, Chicago Nat'l\" on back) - $50\n\nI believe the Sheckard is post-factory as there is front/back damage on this card and others in the lot I purchased.\n\nThe Helm is odd; the yellow pass appears incomplete.  It's offset at the right border (to the left) in a straight line.  It's offset the same amount to the left on Helm's right side from the collar all the way up to the ear with perfect contour.  There is adhesive residue on the back, and the card has been taped together.  Still strange.\n\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/raw/7431/donlin-seated[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/raw/7214/randall[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/raw/7429/sheckard-no-glove[/IMG]",
