      "post_content": "Long story...Had one of these at one time, and traded it to someone who had one of Howe's stamped cards (that meant more to me). Now my son, who is an English lit major in college tells me that it was brought up in classes how Hemingway and Fitzgerald used to fight over the integrity of baseball. Mentioned I used to have one of Fitzgerald's cards, and he went nuts (only recently has he paid any attention to my collection). Thought as a graduation gift in May, I'd like to give him a card once owned by Fitzgerald. Between now and early May, if anyone is interested in getting rid of one, please let me know. Thanks.",
