      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nHoping for some help here. Saw Ted Z's older post regarding collecting quintuplets of one player with similar backs. Since I have the Paskert T206 Broadleaf 350 and T213 Coupon, I'm hoping to add a lower grade example of the Cycle 350 and the American Beauty 350. I think the Drum back is out of my league right now. Please PM me if you are willing to part with either of these two cards. Thanks! Steve",
