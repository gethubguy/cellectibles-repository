      "post_content": "Guys..........For sale is this lot of 11 t205's with Eddie Collins (mouth closed) that range in grades from Poor to VG, in my opinion. Some cards have creases and corner wear and a couple have light paper loss on the back. All the cards have nice color and registration. The Collins grades VG without any creases and an upper right corner ding. Please PM me here or email me at mattpienta at yahoo dot com with questions or to purchase. Preferred payment via Paypal 'gift', but USPS money orders ok, too. Personal checks require 7 days to clear before shipment. US shipping only. Thanks.....Matt\n\n**SOLD***",
