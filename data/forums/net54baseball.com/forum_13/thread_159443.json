      "post_content": "A friend told me that his grandfather was a major league ballplayer. He wanted to know if there were any cards of Byron \"Duke\" Houck who played with the Philadelphia A's in 1912-14. I researched it and found he was listed in the T222 Fatima. If anyone has one and would be willing to sell it I would be interested. Please let me know. Thanks\n\nDon Miller                       email [url]Rellim@abe.midco.net[/url]",
