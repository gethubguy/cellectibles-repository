      "post_content": "Hey guys.\n\nWill post pictures when I get home, but, wanted to get a thread started in case anyone had any immediate questions or desires with these types of cards. \n\nI have 7 T206 Philadelphia cards I've upgraded over the past few months and I'm looking to sell (or trade).  Most I've gotten from folks here and you could find the threads where I bought them.  Not flipping to make money, just moving them on to the next person.  \n\nAs of now, looking for $13 PP gift a piece which breaks me even.  I'll cover shipping.  \n\nNote, all are in rough to beater condition so expect bends and stains.  I'll describe here mostly noting any paper loss and overall condition and post pictures when I get home from work.  \n\nThanks!  \n\nNicholls Fielding - Piedmont 350 - very, very rough front, paper loss, bends, etc.  Pure \"beater\".  Could do this one cheaper than $13, I overpaid.  \n\nDoolan Fielding - Piedmont 350 - stained and some paper loss front\n\nDygert Portrait - Sweet Cap 350 - clean looking front, back has top and bottom semi-circle paper loss.  Prob best \"looking\" card of the group.\n\nCovaleski Standing - Piedmont 150 - sold to me as top trimmed and I believe that to be the case.  Otherwise front clean.  Back has some paper loss.\n\nHartsel Standing - Sweet Cap 350 - front has top paper loss down to the top of his head.  Back has slight paper loss at top.  \n\nJacklitsch Fielding - Sovereign 150 - front clean.  card has bend in top right.  back has some paper loss at bottom\n\nMcQuillian Batting - Piedmont 350 - has 3 major bends.  One right down the middle vertically and 2 horizontally.  some paper loss on front.  Back otherwise ok with no paper loss.\n\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8479/8230231123_16dd610d8b_c.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8230231657_407b6a2cd5_c.jpg[/img]",
