      "post_content": "Two PSA 2 commons just sold for $700 on Sterling Auctions(3/8).  This is Frank Smith(rare version) in a PSA 5! According to PSA Pop. report, this is the highest graded, with a total of only 3 ever graded. Another rare thing about this card is that there are none higher than a psa 7 counting all backs!! Current SMR price for a common back in PSA 5 is $650! Fellow member Scot Reader has this back at a 13x premium for commons based on the current market from all of his research. Scans below, thanks........ Offered at $2750, this is a tremendous investment card....",
