When T205 errors become in vogue as the the T206 errors, this will be a bargain.[/QUOTE]\n\nMy Reulbach was similar.  To me, this is just more evidence that the T205 sheets were printed with yellow ink borders, then the gold was overlaid - I think the ones that look like they have green ink borders or just cases where the gold has been worn off, but had interacted with the yellow to create a green look.  But I'm always happy to find out that I'm wrong, because it means someone's taught me something.\n\nGreat card.",
