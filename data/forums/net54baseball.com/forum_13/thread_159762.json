I am looking for the others now. \nI really would like:\nManion\nHooker\nShag S. \nViolat \nMolesworth\nCarey\netc. \n\nIf you have anything, from 1-3 condition, raw or grade, please send me a PM. I am willing to buy, possibly trade. I am also willing to upgrade 4 of my 5 SL'ers that I already own. Please let me know. Thank you.\n\nMaybe even a Hindu ;)",
