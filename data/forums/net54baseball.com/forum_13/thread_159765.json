Asking $450 for the mini-set... standard paypal preferred.\n\nOf note... \nthe Red Hindu is shellacked or varnished.  A TPG will not slab it, although I guarantee it is authentic.\nthe American Beauty 460 was in an SGC10 slab.\n\nSee all the scans here: [url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/t206hound/t206-devore[/url]",
