      "post_content": "I am considering moving this one. It is the best condition upside down reverse I have seen. I believe SGC down graded the card because the ad is cropped off to the point where the whole ad is not visible. Huge blank area is the result.\n\nI have seen less upside down ads on t206s than most of the ads in the top ten in scarcity. Broad Leaf 460 is ranked 4 and Drum is ranked 5 but there is a huge difference in the total numbers of the known examples. We know of about 50 to 60 BL 460s and there are several hundred or more Drums. I believe upside down backs are somewhere in the middle but much closer to BL 460 than Drum.\n\nI will consider trades or an offer north of 5k.\n\nI will insure and ship the card\n\n[url]stemmers37@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/cfc1909cards/t206sweetcaporal/websize/Batch.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/cfc1909cards/t206sweetcaporal/websize/Batchb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nedit-spelling",

I would imagine that the scarcity of upside down backs would have been compounded by the fact that the printer would probably have destroyed/disgarded the error sheets (or singles after the factory cut) leaving even fewer (if any) to find their way into the packs. An interesting card, nonetheless.\nC.",
