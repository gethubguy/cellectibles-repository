Marquard - HOF - hands at side (Brown Hindu) ... SGC 10 1\n\n4.) Bell - hands above head (Brown Hindu) ... SGC 30 2 ... very solid back\n\n5.) Wagner - bat on left shoulder (Brown Hindu) ... SGC 10 1 ... very solid back\n\n*******\n\nI am looking for the following: T206 backs ... Drum, Uzit, Lenox, Broad Leaf, Red Hindu, Carolina Brights, American Beauty 460, Cycle 460\n\nAlso, I am in the market for a T205 Joss in \"high grade\".\n\nI have some other HOF cards etc. and we can include cash in any deal if necessary. I do not care about the actual grades on the cards, only the eye appeal. If you feel you have a suitable match, feel free to send me a PM and we can begin discussing trade proposals as well as exchanging pictures etc.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDerek",
