      "post_content": "The yellow pass on this card is shifted considerably to the right (player's left).  It reveals that the orange background is comprised of a mix of yellow and pink, and that the grass is obviously a mix of blue and yellow.  Unfortunately the shift isn't great enough to discern the player on the adjacent card.\n\nAsking $75 delivered; paypal preferred.\n\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/raw-for-sale/7689/zimmermann[/IMG]",
