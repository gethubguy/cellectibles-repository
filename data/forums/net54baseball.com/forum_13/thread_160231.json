      "post_content": "Early 19th century Ramly Cigarettes carton for sale. Has heavy toning to the top, the sides and inside are fresh. While these probably did not hold T204 cards due to the size of the carton, the earlier Ramly packs from Mentor Co. were smaller and would fit. A neat carton either way and not expensive SOLD",
