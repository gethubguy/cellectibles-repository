      "post_content": "Thant's right folks. COme one come all. Have a beauty of a Cobb that should sell quick that is DEAD CENTERED with big full boarders front is a very nice 5 grade , the back has a small baby fingernail size p-loss on back that does not detract from the beauty of the card. SGC 20 bat off the best, buy the card not the grade I pd abit less then 1100.00 and would again.  925.00 REDUCED 795.00 REDUCED 795.00 REDUCED 795.00\n\nThe Joss is another and perhaps undergraded at a PSA3 has a very light dirt spot that isnt really noticeable or it should be a strong 5. It has 5.0 to 5.5 corners w/ no creases.\n\nBoth cards are very strong and most who know me ,know that I always buys nice corner cards. Either card has a crease and again are very strong. I pd 177 + 5 shipping for the Joss 157.00 (20 less is fine.\n\nScans up tomorrow. Buy both for 1010.00 ..................call anytime 810-308-4689\n\nThank you all and Happy Holidays",
