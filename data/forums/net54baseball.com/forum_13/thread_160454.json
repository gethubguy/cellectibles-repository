      "post_content": "I have 2 T207s available that I'd like to trade for e98s or t206s or a prewar HOFer.  My e98 list is pretty small, so slim chance there, but I need pretty much EVERY t206 card and t205 card (no need to be a HOFer), and I like HoFers from other years if they are interesting.  Anyway, I can trade one or both to get what I need, and I have a little cash to help if need be.  Thanks!",
