I want it because of my love for the Drummond tobacco company.  I collect everything Drummond related.  I have a huge collection of all all the cards advertisements, boxes etc.  I'm only missing a T206.  This obession goes back to when I was trying a back run a few years ago and had duplicates of everything minus the brown Lenox's and old mills, Ty Cobb and bl460.  The drum shouldn't have been that hard to get, but it was.  \n\nMy search for one took me to St. Louis several times in search of finding a old collector or store that might have one for sale.  During those trips I started coming across different things related to the company and started my quest to learn as much as I could about it.  I took tours of the Drummond mansion in Alton IL. on several occasions hoping to break away and scour their atiq for lost t206's lol.  But what I left with each time was something else, a deeper respect for the company and the companies that produced the cards.  \n\nI began selling off most my backs as I started to realize they really meant nothing more to me than some absurd status symbol and were being used as an investment tool. So now only collect items tgat are sacred to me, like certain things associated to the T206's, and the tobacco companies non card items like packs and boxes and advertisements, but I still want the one thing that created the new passion and love for the items I collect, a T206 drum.  I have the perfect spot ready in my P. Lorillard tobacco cabinet to display it, right next to my T205 drum.  \n\nI love the era and I love even more the city if St. Louis after my trips.  There's something about the city that makes you feel like you're back in time and right there during the golden age of baseball.  It feels like to me like the field of dreams... I know others think its a mess but I love it.  \n\nSo yeah, my passion runs thick to obtain one of these and once I get one I'm done.  That card will never see the market as long as I'm alive.  I'm don't hold cards because of their value to others, or their investment potential.  If the cards lost all their value tomorrow and no one wanted one I would still pay out the ass to get one.  \n\nGood luck to you too in your quest, I hope you don't have to wait as long as I have.",
