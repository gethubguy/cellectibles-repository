Currently collecting the T206 monster with my 9 year old daughter and she fell in love when she saw the pastel colors on the Obaks. Have a budget of around $60.00. If anyone has one available, it would really be appreciated. I'd also consider 1910 & 1911, but I do love the 1909 back style. \n\nThanks and Happy New Year! \n\nSteve",
