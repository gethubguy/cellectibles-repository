Paid $50 for the SGC 45/3.5 and $85 for the SGC 50/4. As you probably know, few cards are offered on the B/S/T that aren't undergraded, and the 50/4 is no exception. Has the corners of a 9!!!!!\n\nOK, it doesn't, but it is a really nice 4.\n\nI'll pay the stupid tax of 10 percent and sell the 45/3.5 for $45 delivered or the 50/4 for $76 delivered. Any type of payment is fine.\n\nThanks, Rob\n\nwolfie51sb at aol.com",
