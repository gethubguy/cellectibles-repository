      "post_content": "Hi all:\nLooking for PSA 2 T206 specifically those that look like near mint cards but have some minor paper loss or better yet glue staining. It does not matter to me how stained the back is if the fronts are good. I'm putting together a nice run of these and I'd like to add some more. I am willing to pay for nice ones or trade even some better grade cards for multiple cards. I'm pushing my beloved T206 collection this way as I am opting for show rather than grade. Would love to see what you all have out there.\nThanks..",
