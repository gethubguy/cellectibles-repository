This time of year, they say it is better to give than to receive.  Here's your opportunity.  :D\n\nI am able to purchase these cards outright or have a fairly nice grouping of cards that I am willing to trade if there is something in particular you are looking for. Please send me a PM if interested. Thank you.  :)",
