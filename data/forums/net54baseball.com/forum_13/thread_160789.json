      "post_content": "Hi, been looking awhile for a low-grade (PSA/SGC 1-3) or raw gradable T210-3 (with clean back) San Antonio card for my tobacco type card set.  I have been waiting specifically for a San Antonio player as I currently live in SA.  As I would love an orange border card, this is likely out of my price range.  Please send PM or email me with any cards available.\nThanks\nDave",
