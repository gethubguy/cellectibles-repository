I believe they present quite well with no glaring issues.\n\nsorry about the bizarre back scan of one group, the odd type does not cover up any grand imperfections, just my magical work with the scanner I guess. To be clear, that bizarre typing is NOT on the cards, it is somehow from my scanning ability.\n\nSOLD for the group delivered via paypal gift, check or MO.\n\nPlease e-mail to contact...No PMs.\n\nthanks - Rob\n[url]rgutheil@gmail.com[/url]\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s119.beta.photobucket.com/user/trobba/media/raw2_zps0c66b58e.jpg.html\"][IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/raw2_zps0c66b58e.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s119.beta.photobucket.com/user/trobba/media/raw2b_zps73c0c360.jpg.html\"][IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/raw2b_zps73c0c360.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
