      "post_content": "Hi all. I have a nice pair of T206 Addie Joss cards I would consider selling or trading in the right deal. I do want to keep them as a pair, at least for now. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you want to chit chat about a potential deal. I tried my best to get as close up on the cards as possible, but I am sure the pictures could be better, so for that I apologize.Thank you everyone for looking.\n\nDerek\n\nJoss (pitching) ...
