      "post_content": "I recently purchased T206 Lee Tannehill PSA5 with Tolstoi reverse.  When I received the card and examined it I found it to have a relatively clear Tolstoi Wet Sheet Transfer on the front.  I do not particularly assign additional value to wet sheet transfers but am aware that some of you may.  I would be willing to part with this at the right price if it interests any of you.  the scans are included below (hopefully they are sized correctly, the last time I tried to post something it was in reduced size for some reason).  Anyway if anyone wants to bid me for this please email me at [url]kardboys@yahoo.com[/url] and I iwll try to respond later this evening, please assume payment by paypal gift.  I will cover postage.  If the pictures are too small send me an email and I will email a scan to you.\n\n\nCheck links for bigger pictures\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/TOPgt.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3cbcV.jpg[/IMG]",
