Someone has also recolored in some of the paper loss spots on the front. \n\nI'm asking $12 each or $20 for the pair. Shipping & handling is included in the price. All forms of payment are accepted.\n\nIf anyone is interested in either or both cards. You can PM me or email me at [url]smorey@neo.rr.com[/url]\n\nThanks,\n\nJantz",
