I have included front & back scans of all cards...note: these larger scans exaggerate any flaws but wanted to be honest on condition.  Lot is for sale for $1800 or b/o.  Please email at:  [url]cuda_1966@hotmail.com[/url].  Thanks for looking. (note, scans of last two cards can be emailed....i was only able to upload the 1st 18 cards... the final two are: \"Too Late for Devlin\" w/Myers & Crandall and \"Wheat Strikes Out\" w/Wheat & Dahlen)",
