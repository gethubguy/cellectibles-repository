      "post_content": "I realize its annoying to not put prices but I really haven't paid attention to the market in awhile and wouldn't really know how much the jackson would be worth anyways, so they are all best offer.\nThe Johnson is a good looking PSA 2 and the M101-2 Joe Jackson is professionally framed with archival museum matting and UV Glass, so it really is a great display piece, the frame couldn't fit on my scanner all the way so I did the best I could and also took a photo to show the framing (lot of glare), feel free to email me with any specific scan requests. Thanks for looking",
