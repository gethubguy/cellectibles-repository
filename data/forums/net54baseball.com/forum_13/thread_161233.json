      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nThis T4 is very, very sharp and clean.  No creases, no stains, no pinholes.  Sharp corners and extra clean and sharp photo.  The back has '164' in light pencil in the upper left - I could easily erase it, but I know it was written on the card at original production or distribution, better to leave it as is.\n\nI don't believe Bues is a documented T4 - until now.  \n\nIf you have any questions, please PM me (please include your email) or email me at [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url]\n\nT4s are obviously scarce and this one is really as nice as they come.  I'm asking - SOLD!!   Thank you very much.  \n\nThanks,\nCraig",

I have often wondered who the photographer was that photographed the players in the Pacific Coast and Northwest League. For my money, the T4s and the Horner Cabinets are as good as it gets. \n\nGood luck on the sale!\n\n\nPatrick",
