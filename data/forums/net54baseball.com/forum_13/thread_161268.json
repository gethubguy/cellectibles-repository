      "post_content": "Hello all,\n\nI'm rather new to the vintage card circuit and am looking to pick up a low grade Matty card.  I've been a huge Matty fan since I read \"Pitching in a Pinch\" in HS.  I'd like a turn of the century card nothing past his playing days.  I'd perfer PSA or SCG in a 1,2 or even just an authentic.  I'm looking to spend around $200 so I know I can't be picky.  I just want one that has some visual appeal as it'll be to display and will never be sold.  \n\nSorry, it's a bit vague but it's been a goal of mine and I'd like to reach it.\n\nThanks,\n\nBrian",
