I need to unload it, unfortunately, but I haven't been too serious about it since my e98 project has really taken off and my T206s as well.\n\nHere's what I have:\n\nBarry - Honest Long Cut - fair w/ creases and rounded corners, but nicely centered\nBirmingham - Sweet Cap Black - fair with multiple creases\nDoyle - Piedmont - trimmed at top, otherwise nice card\nElberfeld - Piedmont - VG except for small pencil writing on back\nFoxen - Piedmont - poor w/ multiple creases, rounded corners, and bottom middle border missing\nLord, Bris - Hassan - poor w/ tac hole at bottom and tac hole gone bad at top!  :) Otherwise a nice card.\nLord, Harry - Honest Long Cut - minor trimming at top, minor corner crease and a couple rounded corners.  presents very well\nMcElveen - Sweet Cap Black - SGC 30\nMerkle - Piedmont - poor - part of border ripped off at top\nMilan - Honest Long Cut - poor/fair - multiple creases and rounded corners and stamped H on back\nMiller - Honest Long Cut - good w/ worn corners and small surface crease\nPayne - Hassan - poor because of two tac hole incidents, but otherwise a very presentable card\nRowan SP - Piedmont - poor/fair - couple of tac holes on front that do not impede with the picture and perhaps green added to the top right corner.  nice looking card otherwise\nSchaefer - Hassan - fair/good - rounded corners and one solid crease\nStone - Sweet Cap Red - good o/c with part of another card showing on back\nThomas - Polar Bear - good....but great looking card!\nWolter - Piedmont - SGC 10\n\nJimi",
