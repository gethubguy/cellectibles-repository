      "post_content": "After seeing my wife start and almost finish her FIRST ever sports card set within 6 months, I would like to finish my set that I started almost 6 years ago.  It is amazing how quickly one can finish something if they stay completely focused.  She started collecting the 2012 Topps Pink Breast Cancer Awareness Football set this past August and is down to needing 3 cards.  I thought it would have taken her longer to complete, but I've got to give it to her, she stayed focused and has done a fantastic job getting to where she is today with that.\n\nMy resolution is for me to finish my T205 set that I started in 2007.  I am on the final stretch and need 11 cards to complete my set.  I'm looking for the following cards in Good condition (SGC 30) range.  Would prefer to buy in a lot.  Let me know what you have.\n\n\nJosh Devore\nRichard Egan\nRichard Hoblitzell - no stats (should someone have one lying around)\nThomas Jones\nJohn Kling\nAmbrose McConnell\nJohn McLean\nMichael Mitchell\nGeorge Moriarity\nGeorge Mullin\nCharles Schmidt\n\nr/\nFrank",
