      "post_content": "T3 Turkey Red Christy Mathewson - Graded PSA-3MK.\n\nNot sure about the MK, but it must be the faint mark or two on the right front border, can't see anything else.\n\nThe bottom left corner chip is obvious, but overall it is a beautiful card with a clean, clear and focused image.  No creases that I can detect.\n\nNot sure about VCP, but SMR on a PSA-3 is $2200, on a PSA-2 it's $1300.  SOLD - Thank you!\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions.  PM me or email me direct at [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url]\n\nThanks,\nCraig",
