      "post_content": "Hey all, up for trade is one T201 (Seymour/Dygert has been traded).\n\n#1 The Seymour/Dygert SGC 30 is a dupe and I would like to swap it for one of my wants on my wish list below.  I would consider and even swap with another common from my list same grade, preferably SGC graded. GONE\n\n#2 The Killian/Fitzpatrick is a keeper in my set however I am working on an SGC set.  I would like to trade this PSA 3.5 for the same card graded by SGC, obviously same grade or slightly above and I will add some cash.  \n\ntake a look at the pix and let me know if you have any interest or more detailed shots.  \n\nthanks!\n\nCliff\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84498&d=1358261287[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84499&d=1358261306[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84500&d=1358261317[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84501&d=1358261328[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84503&d=1358261339[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=84504&d=1358261351[/IMG]\n\nwant list:\n\n2Collins/Baker\n\n4Barrett/McGlynn\n\n5Lapp/Barry\n\n6Bender/Oldring\n\n7Wheat/Bergen\n\n8Hartzell/Blair\n\n9Huggins/Bresnahan\n\n10Matthewson/Bridwell\n\n12Clarke/Byrne\n\n13Evers/Chance\n\n14Chase/Sweeney\n\n17Crawford/Cobb\n\n18Kling/Cole\n\n19Thomas/Coombs\n\n20Rucker/Daubert\n\n22Titus/Dooin\n\n25Doyle/Meyers\n\n28Lajoie/Falkenberg\n\n31Foster/Ward\n\n32Speaker/Gardner\n\n33Leach/Gibson\n\n34Mattern/Graham\n\n36Lush/Hauser\n\n37Miller/Herzog\n\n38Hickman/Hinchman\n\n39Summers/Jennings\n\n40Johnson/Street\n\n43Leifield/Simon\n\n46McGinnity/McCarty\n\n48Walsh/Payne\n\n49Turner/Stovall\n\n50Woodruff/Williams",
