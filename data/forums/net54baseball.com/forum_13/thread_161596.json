      "post_content": "I had to sell most of my small collection of T206 cards a couple of years ago, but now have been slowly re-acquiring as I can.\n\nI collect lower grade T206 cards (Fair range) that have generally good appeal (can have some paper missing on back and possibly small amount on front.\n\nLooking for a Hooks Wiltse portrait with cap card, any brand back, in the $15 range. \n\nAlso would like to acquire a Tolstoi back card, just about any player in the Fair $15 range would be fine, as I don't have a Tolstoi back in my collection.\n\nI understand that the Wiltse card that I am looking for also came in a Tolstoi back, so that would be great and would \"kill two birds with one stone,\" so to speak.\n\nThank you all in advance.",
