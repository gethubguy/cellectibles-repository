      "post_content": "I have for sale the following 8 T206 HOFers, all graded SGC 50 (4).  All are very nicely centered and present well.  I thought I would try to list them here before going to eBay, therefore I have priced these lower than VCP considering that I don\u2019t have to pay any eBay seller fees.  You save money, I save fees.  All the backs are clean.  Scans of the back are available upon request, but I will not hold a card.  In other words, if you ask for a back scan and someone else commits to the card before I am able to provide the scan, the one who first committed to the card gets it.  All prices include shipping.  Since I\u2019ve priced these lower than VCP, and the shipping is included, I ask that payment be made via PayPal gift.  If you\u2019re uncomfortable with that, regular PayPal is fine, but please add 3%.  \n\n*** SOLD*** Fred Clarke - Holding Bat - Sweet Caporal 150\nVCP $180 / Your price $167\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206ClarkeHoldingBat.jpg[/IMG]\n\nVic Willis \u2013 Portrait - Piedmont 150\nVCP $182 / Your price $169\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206Willis.jpg[/IMG]\n\nChief Bender - Pitching, With Trees in Background - Piedmont 350\nVCP $202 / Your price $185\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206BenderPitchingwithTrees.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** Mordecai Brown - Chicago On Shirt - Sweet Caporal 350\nI believe the VCP data to be wrong for this card.  It shows a recent sale of $1015 and therefore escalated the average sale price.  I\u2019m guessing the VCP to be in the $200 ballpark.  Your price $183\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206BrownChicagoonShirt.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** Addie Joss \u2013 Pitching - Sweet Caporal 350\nVCP $159 / Your price $148\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206JossPitching.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** Joe Kelley - Sweet Caporal 350\nVCP $138 / Your price $129\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206Kelley.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** Iron Man McGinnity - Sweet Caporal 350\nVCP $153 / Your price $143\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206McGinnity.jpg[/IMG]\n\n***SOLD*** John McGraw - Glove At Hip - Sweet Caporal 350-460\nVCP $203 / Your price $185\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/T206McGrawGloveatHip.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf you feel I've made an error in pricing, just let me know and I'll take a look at it.  No further discounts will be given.  If you buy more than one card, I can knock off another $3 or so since I'm saving on combined shipping, but that is pretty much it.  Thanks for looking!",
