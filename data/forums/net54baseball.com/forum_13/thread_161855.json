      "post_content": "This is a T206 Peaches Graham card missing the red ink. You can see the lot listing this was purchased in by looking at B & L Auctions from Winter 2012. I would like to recoup my purchase price but would consider a trade for something I need. Always looking for T206 PD 42's, Cycle 460's and AB 460's to name a few. $550 or B/O cash or trade.\n\nPM's and emails will be returned as quickly as possible.\n\nThanks",
