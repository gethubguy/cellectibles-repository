I can always start it over again, right?\n\nI'd really like to unload in one lot so that I can move on more quickly and work with just one person...HOWEVER, if a couple days go by and no one goes after them all, then I will exercise the possibility of smaller lots and/or individuals.\n\nAbbaticchioBlue SleevesPiedmont350-46025PittsburghPSA3.5\nAbbaticchioBrown SleevesPiedmont15025PittsburghPSA2\nAbbottPortraitPiedmont35025ToledoPSA4\nAbsteinPortraitPiedmont35025PittsburghPSA4\nAdkinsPortraitPiedmont35025BaltimorePSA3\nAlpermanBattingSweet Caporal150 o.649BrooklynPSA3\nAmes        Hands Over HeadPolar Bear 6NY Nat'LPSA2\nBatchPortraitSweet Caporal35025RochesterPSA3\nBergenBattingPiedmont15025BrooklynPSA3\nBradleywith BatPiedmont350-46025Cleveland NapsPSA3\nCree Piedmont35025NY AmericanPSA2.5\nEgan Piedmont35025CincinnatiPSA3\nDoyleHands Above HeadSweet Caporal35030NYPSA1\nFlanaganPortraitPiedmont35025BuffaloPSA2\nPurtellPiedmont35025Chicago A.PSA2\nSweeney Old Mill 25NY AmericanPSA3\nWillisPortraitSweet Caporal15025PittsburghPSAAUTHENTIC\n\nLooking to get $875 shipped for the lot.
