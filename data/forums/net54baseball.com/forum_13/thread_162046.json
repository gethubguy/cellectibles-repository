      "post_content": "Hey guys. I thought it would be a good idea to create a thread here where t206 collectors can post what they are looking for and hopefully find a match. It's basically a want list. There are previous threads like this, which worked really well, but are not used anymore. So let me start off. I am looking for: \n\n  * Hall of Famers (Basically any;  SGC or PSA 3-4 condition please) \n  * Southern Leaguers (Basically any) \n  * Tough Commons (Ganley, Dahlen, etc.) \n  * Harder backs and SC Factory 42 overprint, 350-460 SC (factories 25, 30, and 42) and Sovereign 150. \n\n\nJust some ideas. Please, post your want list and hopefully we can find a match! Best regards. Maybe we can work a trade!",
