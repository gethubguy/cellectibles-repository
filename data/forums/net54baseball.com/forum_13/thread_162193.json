And as a shameless but very legitimate plug we at Brockelman and Luckey Auctions will have several hundred very low grade, first time to the hobby, T206s in our next auction, next month. We will try to put them in a bit smaller lot sizes so everyone can afford them. Our preview won't be up until a few days before the auction...   [url]www.b-lauctions.com[/url]    best regards",

A couple of them had almost 100 creases but for some reason the cards still had nice appeal to me. When looking at the cards; I almost didn't notice all of the creases.\n\nKeep 'em coming!\n\nI will keep an eye on your auction.\n\nCraig",
