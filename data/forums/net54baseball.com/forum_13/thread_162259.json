      "post_content": "Hey everyone, I hope all is well. I've had this Mordecai Brown in my collection for a few years now, so the time has come where I am ready to upgrade it. It's a beautiful card, aside from that punch hole. Regardless of the hole, it doesn't take away from the beauty of the card. I would love to upgrade it to a SGC or PSA 3-4. I would also consider the portrait and Cubs version as well. Thanks and some responses would be greatly appreciated. Thanks once again.",
