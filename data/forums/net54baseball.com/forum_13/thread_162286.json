I will resist the urge to comment on my recent pick-ups until they arrive to their new home, right here in my collection! That being said, I have made several deals for numerous cards. I am still open and looking but my want / fill list is getting somewhat smaller. But you better act now, I am in negotiations to possibly puchase a 1964 Dodge Dart so my card funds may be finally drying up.\n\nThanks again to those that have really helped me out with this new direction to my collection.\n\nTom",
