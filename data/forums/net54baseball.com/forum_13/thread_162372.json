      "post_content": "Hi there T206 guys. \n\nI have a small batch of T206 available for sale, featuring a HOF, as well as four Star cards. All of the cards are pretty solid looking in my opinion, and they present nicely.\n\nI am looking for $525 for the group if paid via paypal gift or by check. If you would like to pay via regular paypal, that is fine as well, but it will be your responsibility to cover the additional fees that paypal would take away from us. I will cover the cost of shipping. \n\nThank you very much.\n\nDerek\n\n1.) Johnny Evers (portrait) ... Piedmont 150 ... PSA 2 ... hairline crease\n2.) Ed Ruelbach (glove shows) ...Piedmont 150 ...
