Unfortunately the availability of very, very low end cards seems to be either feast or famine and either reasonable in cost or way out of line (to me and my budget).  Even if I had the money for high quality cards, I'm not sure they're for me.  I prefer the ripped, beat up, creased cards I have hunted down and dealt for.    \n\nThanks for the deal CardTarget.  Those will look nice among my trashed T206 collection.",
