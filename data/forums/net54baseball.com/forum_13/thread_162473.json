      "post_content": "Hey guys, I can't believe it already, but after my recent trade (Thanks so much Matthew!), I'm already at 22/36 backs in the set. 36, of the ones in which I count of course. I've collected all over the place, and my new recent goal is to complete my back run by the time I'm 20. I know this is kind of fast (4 years is fast to me), but I'm ready to face it. Any help would be much appreciated. \n\nRight now cannot afford those true toughies: Red Hindu, Lenox, Drum, Brown Old Mill, etc, but I can dream! \n\nRight now I am looking to purchase or trade for:\nSweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 25. \nSweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 42 Overprint\nSovereign 150 Subjects \nAmerican Beauty 350 (No frame)\nAmerican Beauty 460\n\nIf I obtain these other 5 backs, I will be at 27/36, or 75% down with my back run. That'd be awesome! I'd love to be able to say that by this year. I am in no rush of course, but I know these backs are obtainable. Thanks once again.",
