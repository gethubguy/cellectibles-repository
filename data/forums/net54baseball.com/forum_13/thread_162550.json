      "post_content": "Hello,\nI have the following T205 Richard Hoblitzell variations available for sale or trade.  Both are considered tougher short prints in the set and are difficult to find in decent condition:\n\nHoblitzel (name incorrect) Sweet Caporal Fac. 42 - card is miscut top/bottom and has a slight diamond cut.  Double border showing on the top back.  Light edge and corner wear.  I would grade this as VG/EX.  Price $150 delivered.\n\nHoblitzell (name correct, no \"Cin\") Piedmont Fac. 25 - light paper scuffing near top border on back and a black print mark on the top front border.  I would grade this at G/VG.  Price $125 delivered.\n\n\nTake both for $250 delivered.  I would also consider trades for any similarly valued tobacco or caramel cards I need from any sets I'm working on.\n\nI accept payment via any method you prefer.  Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions, trade offers, or to purchase a card.  Thanks for looking!",
