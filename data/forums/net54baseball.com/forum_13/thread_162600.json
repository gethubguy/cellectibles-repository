      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have a PSA 3 T206 Cy Young Bare Hand For Sale. This is a really nice looking card. I know people make this comment, but you will be hard pressed to find a nicer PSA 3.\n\nThe card is perfectly centered with bright and bold color. The card itself is even bolder in person than on the scan. I think that the card was graded a 3 because of a bump in the upper right corner. I didn't see a crease elsewhere.\n\nThis is really a nice card for the grade. I am asking $900 for it. I prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order. But I can accept other forms of payment if that is a hardship. \n\nIf you would like to buy the card, you can contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url].\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-511b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-511rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks\n\nCy",
