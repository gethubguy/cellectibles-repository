      "post_content": "THE CARDS HAVE ALL BEEN SOLD. Thank you.\n\nHi,\n\nI have 15 of the T206 Pittsburgh Pirates for sale. These 15 cards are all graded by PSA. The grades range from PSA 3 through PSA 6. There are three PSA 6 cards, including the Clarke portrait. Along with these three, the other cards are very nice for the grade. Most are perfectly centered.\n\nTo buy the cards, you can contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\nI prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order. But I will accept PayPal and checks, too.\n\nTo view the cards, with prices, click the following link:\n[url]http://www.cyscards.com/t206.htm[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
