      "post_content": "Just purchased a small collection of tobacco packs, and included was a wonderful 1910s Polar Bear tobacco pouch, full with all of the original tobacco.  I hate to call this pack unopened because, as can be seen, parts of the tax stamp have torn, so the top flap could be opened if one would like.  However, the pack is completely full, without any tobacco seepage at all.\n\nThe pouch is in wonderful condition, with no rips or tears to the front, back or sides.  All top flaps are intact and folded over.  However, as noted above, the tax stamp is missing in two spots along the top flap.  The pack is from the right factory/district (6, Ohio), and has a 1910 tax stamp, dating it to the 1910s period (although it is impossible to definitively date it to a certain year.)\n\nPretty rare opportunity to pick up a Polar Bear pouch, and a full one to boot.\n\nSOLD shipped/insured.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0138_zpse06eb804.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0139_zpsc40f8e6d.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0140_zps24c02ed8.jpg[/IMG]",
