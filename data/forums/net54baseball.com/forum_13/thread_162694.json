In fact, there are only 101 different cards that have been graded in total by SGC, and far less by PSA.\n\nIt should be fun but it will take you a while.  You may have to buy some raw cards and send them in and hope they will get a 40.  If I run across anyone who has one I will send them your way.

I knew that these were harder to find, but I had no idea that there were so few graded at my target grade.  I'll have to rethink my strategy for building this set.",

I own 31 of those and none are graded SGC 40.\n\nThis set is plagued by cracking due to the shellack like surface, so very few are graded at vg or above.\n\nYou will be able to get more than half the set (100 to 120 cards)and then it will get difficult. The next 30 to 40 cards are very tough. Then the  hard part comes. The last dozen or so are next to impossible.   \n\nAndy worked on this set for more than 10 years and still had a 6 or 8 card want list. I think finally this past year he sold them off.\n\nCoupons, all three types are extremely difficult sets to complete and maybe impossible now. I have heard of complete sets of type 1 and type 3 but maybe only 1 complete type 2 set. Try to get in touch with Andy, his 54 user is t213. He will be able to give you the  most solid info.",
