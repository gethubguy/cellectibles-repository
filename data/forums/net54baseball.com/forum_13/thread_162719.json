      "post_content": "For sale is a T206 Egan printing error. As can be seen in the scans there is no red on \"Cincinnati\" on the jersey. I have provided a correct version for comparison.\n\nThe card is not 100% missing red ink, it just missed the mark when printing \"Cincinnati\" on the jersey. There are a few red pixels within the white letters, but the majority (which is a little bit of red) are in the blue jersey and can be seen under a loupe.\n\nThe card has creasing and paper loss on the back. \n\nI am asking $300 OBO.\n\nPlease email me at [url]smithvintagecards@gmail.com[/url] with interest or questions. No PMs please.\n\nDanny\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=86314&d=1359844210[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=86315&d=1359844224[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=86316&d=1359844235[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=86317&d=1359844248[/IMG]",
