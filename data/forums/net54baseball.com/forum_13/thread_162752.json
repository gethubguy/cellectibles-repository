      "post_content": "Starting a T206 HOF Portrait collection from scratch.  Looking for ANY HOF portraits, graded or ungraded, in lower condition (think PSA 1-2, paper loss, marks, and creases welcomed).  From Cobb to Crawford, Bender to Baker.  Probably can't afford some of the bigger names, but you never know. \n\nI also have some T205 HOFers and some other misc. cards to trade if anyone's interested. \n\nEmail scans and prices to [url]poorlydrawncat@gmail.com[/url].  Thanks!",
