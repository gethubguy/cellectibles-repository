      "post_content": "Hello!\n\nI have a group of ten T206 cards for sale:\n\n1.) Jack Pfeister (throwing) ... American Beauty 350 (no decorative frame) ...\nthis one is raw, and has creasing in the shape of a \"t\". The back still presents well in my opinion... ON HOLD\n\n2.) Bill Carrigan ... Sweet Cap 350 f.30 ... PSA 5 ... SOLD\n\n3.) Ed Reulbach (glove shows) ... Piedmont 150 ... PSA 3... ON HOLD\n\n4.) Chief Meyers (fielding) ... Piedmont 350 ... PSA 3 ... ON HOLD\n\n5.)Doc White (portrait) ... Piedmont 350 ... PSA 4... ON HOLD\n\n6.) Johnny Evers (portrait) ... Piedmont 150 ... PSA 2... ON HOLD\n\n7.) Johnny Evers (Cubs on shirt/blue sky) ... Piedmont 150 ... SGC 30 2\n\n8.) Mordecai Brown (Cubs on shirt) ... Sweet Cap 150 f.30 ... SGC 40 3 ... ON HOLD\n\n9.) Rube Marquard (portrait) ... Piedmont 350 ... SGC 50 4 ... SOLD\n\n10.) Shag Shaughnessy ... Old Mill ... SGC 40 3\n\nThe group has solid eye appeal. My preferred method of payment is Paypal Gift, so we do not have to incur any fees. If you prefer to pay via regular Paypal, that is fine as well, but it will be your responsibility to cover any fees.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDerek",
