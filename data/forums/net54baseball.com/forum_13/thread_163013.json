Some have been sitting on Ebay collecting dust for months on end due to the WAY over inflated price tags on them.  Nobody is obviously interested in dropping $3,000+ for a 3 or 4 grade, not to mention the card (along with most T206s) are a dime a dozen.  You shouldn't have very much trouble snagging one for a decent (non ebay) price.",

I am willing to pay strong but not crazy.  I would have thought it would not be hard to find one as they are plentiful, but one has eluded me so far...",
