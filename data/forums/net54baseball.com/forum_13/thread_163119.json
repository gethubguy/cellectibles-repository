      "post_content": "I have decided to part with my full run of t206 Ganleys. Some of these don't fit into my current collection and it was the fun of the chase that gave me the satisfaction now they are locked in a box, while my others are on display. \n\nI would like to first try to sell as a group and if that does not work I will break up this nice run.\nI would like to get 1250.00 for the complete collection which is less than what I paid for all of the cards. As you know the El Principe and Piedmont 350 are very tough cards.\n\n The two Sweet Caporals, the Piedmont 150 and the Hindu are all graded the rest are raw.\npms or email my email is [url]ddm4236@comcast.net[/url]",
