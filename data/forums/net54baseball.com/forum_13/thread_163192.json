      "post_content": "Hello friends.  This T3 of Niles is a bit on the tougher side (or so I have been told).  Besides the obvious flaw in the upper left corner, it is pinhole free, and has no creasing.  Some light staining below the upper left border as well.  The image is bright and bold.  \n\nAsking $120 PP Owed/Gift, Check, MO, Cash all good.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nBest,\n\nAndy",
