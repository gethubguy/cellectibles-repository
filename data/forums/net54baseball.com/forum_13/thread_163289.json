      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have for sale a T206 Walter Johnson portrait. It's a beautiful card , but it is short, top-to-bottom. It is trimmed on the bottom edge. I want you to be aware of that.\n\nBut this is a beautiful card with bold, bright colors and no creases. It also has a Sovereign back. I am asking $825 or best offer. I prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order, but I will accept a check or Paypal, if a money order is a problem.\n\nYou can contact me directly at:cy@cyscards.com if you would like to buy it.\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-230b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-230rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
