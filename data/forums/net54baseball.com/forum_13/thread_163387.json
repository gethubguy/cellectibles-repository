I'm looking to trade straight up for a card I need in similar condition, but would be willing to go the cash route for nicer condition if anyone has any of these.  My goal is to complete this set, but I will also consider trading this card for various poor condition T's, E's, or M116's if anyone is interested. Thanks. -marshall",
