      "post_content": "I'm selling/trading a lot of my misc. card collection to re-focus my collecting on the T206 set.  For awhile I was a type collector, but now I'm focusing on completing the Monster minus the Big 4.\n\nBelow are three cards up for sale/trade for T206 cards I don't have.\n\n1920 W516-1 Walter Johnson Hand Cut, PSA graded AUTHENTIC.  There is a vertical crease running down the middle of the card and \"JOHN\" written on the reverse.\n\n[IMG]http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y283/Clark7781/1920W516-1WalterJohnsonPSAAuthFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y283/Clark7781/1920W516-1WalterJohnsonPSAAuthBack.jpg[/IMG]\n\n1909 E90-1 Joe Tinker Amer Crml, PSA graded Authentic.
