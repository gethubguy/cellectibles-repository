I prefer paypal gift, but if you want to pay via regular paypal, that is fine as well, but it will be your responsibility to cover the additional fees that paypal would charge.\n\nThank you, and feel free to pm me with any questions.\n\nWiltse, Hooks (portrait-cap)/ Piedmont 460 f.25/ SGC 40 3 ... this one has a slight wet sheet transfer on the bottom left/ front.\n\nSchlei, Admiral (batting)/ Piedmont 460/ SGC 40 3 \n\n Fiene, Lou (throwing)/ Sweet Cap 350 f. 30/ SGC 40 3\n\nEwing, Bob/ Piedmont 150/ SGC 40 3",
