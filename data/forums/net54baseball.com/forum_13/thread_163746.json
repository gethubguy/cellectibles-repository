      "post_content": "This is a cool card that I know will be appreciated here.  \n\nBright orange background, clean Hindu reverse, PSA-5.  Hopefully the scans speak for themselves.\n\nNot exactly sure how to look it up, but I think similar examples have sold for $4k-$5k over the last year or two.\n\nI am looking to sell this card but am having a hard time letting it go.  No rush to sell, per se, but I'm no longer a serious T206 collector and it seems like this card deserves to be in someone else's collection at this point.  Please make me an offer I can't refuse - serious offers only, thanks.\n\nHappy Collecting,\nCraig",
