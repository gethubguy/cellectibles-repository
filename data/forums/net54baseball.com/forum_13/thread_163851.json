      "post_content": "This T3 Turkey Red of Sam Crawford is soooo nice.  This card came from my South Carolina find of late 2011, purchased from the grandson of the original owner.\n\nThe color and focus are wonderful.  It should probably be a 5MK, but whatever.  It's such a beautiful example of this popular card.\n\nMy scanner is giving me problems currently so the card is shown \"pre-slab\", but it now resides in a PSA-4MK holder, cert #19279988.  If you need scans of the card in the holder, no problem, but be patient - thanks.\n\nAsking only SOLD, shipped and insured.  Thanks again.\n\nHappy Collecting,\nCraig",

      "post_content": "Sharp card.  You can actually get a better sense of the condition outside of the holder.   I'd be all over this if it wasn't for the fact I already have this card.\n\nWhat does the notation on the reverse say?  \"Peid pleasant drug\"???\n\nAll the best, Craig.  I'll be on the lookout for any future T3s you post.",
