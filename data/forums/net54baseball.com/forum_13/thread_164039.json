      "post_content": "Looking for PSA 4 non-standard backs (Sweet Cap, Piedmont) in PSA 4 in any HOFer, Cicotte, Burns, and Chase.  Trying to add a few back variations to my collection.  The only thing that I really look for is that the image and back advertisement not be sloped in any way.  Figured this time I'd also put some trade bait out there.  All PSA 4:\n\nBrown Chicago Shirt SC\nChance Yellow Portrait PM\nEd Collins Portrait SOV\nMatty Portrait PM\nMcGraw Glove at Hip SC (with wet sheet transfer)\n\nHopefully a possible trade raises some interest.",
