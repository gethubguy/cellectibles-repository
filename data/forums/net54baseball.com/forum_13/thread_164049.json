      "post_content": "I bought this card on ebay recently and was happy to have it.  Then, several days later, a T205 Joss with a Cycle back became available, and I bought it too.  Since I am more interested in the scarce back than the miscut, I would like to trade the miscut for other items I am interested in.  \n\nI would consider any of the following: lot of T206 commons in VG-EX condition, T206 hofers (VG-EX), T3, Sporting News supplements, Cracker Jack Collins and/or Plank (either year), items related to Mike Donlin, Deacon Phillippe, Doc White.  Also would love to have a GPC Honus Wagner.\n\nPlease email me at the address below if you would like to discuss a trade.\n\nMark\n[url]drumback2@cox.net[/url]",
