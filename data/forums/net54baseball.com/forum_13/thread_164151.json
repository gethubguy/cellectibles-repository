      "post_content": "Hi All.\n\nI am still looking for a T206 Zachariah Wheat with an American Beauty back!\n\nI have a few interesting cards here (back stamp/ historical writing ... diamond cut ... slight wet sheet transfer), and perhaps we can strike a deal, should you have a Wheat to spare:\n\n1.) Jon McGraw (portrait-NO cap) ... Brown Hindu ... SGC 10 1 ... this is kind of a unique card. On the back, there is stamping and writing: stamped: \"Fredrick Benedict Gessner\" ... writing: initials \"f.b.g.\", and in a nice calligraphy style writing \"Princeton\".\n\n2.) Sam Crawford (with bat) ... American Beauty 350 (NO decorative frame)... SGC 40 3 this one has a unique cut to it, as you can see.\n\n3.) Hooks Wiltse (portrait-w/ cap) ... Piedmont 460 f. 25 ... SGC 40 3 ... this one has a slight wet sheet transfer on the bottom left/ front. Kind of quirky I suppose.\n\n\n\nShoot me a PM. Thanks!\n\nDerek",
