      "post_content": "EDIT:  Father-in-law is officially retired.  No more boxes.....\n\n\nTime for another wooden storage box from my father-in-law @ [URL=\"http://www.dakotawoodcrafts.com\"]dakotawoodcrafts.com[/URL]\n\nIn the past several years, he has sold dozens of boxes to Net54 members at a discount.  \n\nHis current project is for the raw card collectors out there - with the ability to hold graded cards too.  Holds about 40 SGC tall boy holders on their side.  Normal PSA/SGC holders can be stored on their sides or flat.  About 56 stacked in 4 rows of 14.\n\nDesigned to hold about 420 Ultra-Pro standard (3x4) top loaders.  Similar to the 'T206' boxes - just larger.  Made with solid oak.  Removable clear dividers.  Green felt inside and outside bottom.  Strong hinge.  Key lock.  Size is about 14\" wide, 9.25\" wide and 5.75\" tall.\n\nSee pictures for some examples.\n\nPrice is set at $170 delivered.  Nearly $50 of that is shipping and professional packaging.  Please PM and will will pass along payment details and get your name on the list.  First production will include about 10 boxes.  PM with any questions.  \n\nI will post this in a couple B/S/T sections at a time.\n\nOther boxes available:\n\nTobacco (T card) box:\n[URL=\"http://net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=178354\"]LINK TO POST[/URL]\n\nGraded card box: \n[URL=\"http://net54baseball.com/showthread.php?p=1050932#post1050932\"]LINK TO POST[/URL]\n\n\n\n[url]https://net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=439744&stc=1&d=1612880849[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.billripken.com/bucket/boxraw.jpg[/IMG]",
