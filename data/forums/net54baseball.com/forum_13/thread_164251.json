      "post_content": "I am looking to obtain the earliest card of each HOFer that I can get my hands on.  At this point, I want to unload some of my raw cards to help in getting graded examples.  So, perhaps, say you have an earlier Flick than I have.  I'm hoping to unload mine, which is a rough t206, in order to get a graded t206 or an earlier card of him.  Perhaps I'd use other cards to enhance the trade or cash.  I'm ok with blockbuster-type trades as well!  :)  Let me know what graded HOFers you have.  Thanks!\n\nJimi",
