      "post_content": "After nine years at it, closing in on 300 and looking to buy lots or singles to get near the 400 plateau.  Will pay pretty strong for the subjects I need--especially the known toughies.  Prefer PSA 5 but will consider PSA 6 and raw EX or better.  No qualifiers. Any back okay but will pay a due premium for tougher ones.  Email sarpc at qwestoffice dot net or PM.  Thanks.  Scot Reader\n\nEdited to add:  Have some really nice non-T206 PSA and SGC pre- and post-war HOF to trade as an alternative to buying.  Mostly from mainstream sets.  See [url]http://thereadercollection.weebly.com/inventory--want-list.html[/url] for details.",
