      "post_content": "Hi there. Looking to buy a few T206s with high eye appeal in the $50-99 range. Graded VGEX or worse SGC or PSA. Nice color, sharpish corners, decent l/r centering. No noticeable paper loss back.  Cards like this:\n\n[url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/nollpm/pre-war[/url]\n\nPM me if you have anything that might meet these qualifications.",
