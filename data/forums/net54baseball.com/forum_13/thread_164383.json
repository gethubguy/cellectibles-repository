      "post_content": "Just bought a nice lot of 10. Six I needed plus a couple of upgrades so I am\nleft with these four guys to trade. They are Ball (Cleveland), Kruger, Lake (no ball in hand) and Pastorius.  My monster number is 251 so there are probably 200 commons I need. Sorry I don't have a wantlist.  Let me know what you have to swap. I prefer to trade for now but will entertain offers to buy if they are not spoken for by Monday.",
