      "post_content": "Here are three raw T3 Turkey Reds. Each is lower grade, but still very attractive, collectible and priced to sell. Backs are clean but happy to send scans (please include email address with requests). \n\nI'm offering three other T3 HOFers in lower grade PSA - Tinker, Jennings, McGraw - in another thread \n\nI have four other T3 HOFers, higher graded by PSA, higher prices as well - Mathewson, Young, Lajoie, Griffith. Please ask if interested.\n\nT3 Turkey Red Hall of Famers! \n\nEvers - no creases, no pinholes, extra nice picture, some \"cleaning\" on the borders - $300\nJoss - SOLD  Thx!\nWalsh - no creases, no pinholes, would probably grade a 2 or 3, but is kinda ugly - $275\n\nThanks very much! - Craig",
