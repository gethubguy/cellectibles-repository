The t205s are all nicer with fewer creases than the t206s but both present well for the grade.\n\nt205s - ALL SOLD\nDowney \nFrick\nLank\nMattern\nMiller\nPeskert\nSheckard\nStreet\n\nt206 - ALL SOLD\nMatty SOLD\nCrawford SOLD\nLake\n\ncrandall \ndonovan\neasterly\nrossman - SOLD\nbush - SOLD\nwright\n\nId do the remaining 5 t206s for SOLD to the first that says They'll take it.
