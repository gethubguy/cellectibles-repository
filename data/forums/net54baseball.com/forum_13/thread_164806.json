      "post_content": "The Big Train gazes serenely past the photographer in this superb example of cardboard portraiture.  There are no direct synonyms for the color of the beautiful display of perfectly-placed ink droplets sublimely placed to Mr. Johnson's posterior, or I certainly would let at least one, perhaps more, flow forth from this poor representation of pen and ink. \n\nThe importance of the rubescent cranial remains of the numbers three and zero, resting quietly at the base of the Sweet Caporal advertisement (spoken with accent on the second syllable), cannot be overstated, but can certainly be understated, a sad occurrence which I am in no danger of inflicting upon the creamy behind of this amazing tobacco-related relic.",
