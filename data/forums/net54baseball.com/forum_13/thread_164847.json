      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have for sale a nice T207 Chief Bender in a PSA 4 holder. This is a very nice card. You will be pleased with this card.\n\nI am asking $190 for the card. I prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order. But if that is a problem, I will accept PayPal.\n\nIf you would like to buy it, you can contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t207/picsb/07-011b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t207/picsb/07-011rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
