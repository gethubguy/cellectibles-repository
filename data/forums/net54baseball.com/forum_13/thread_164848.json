It has a Sovereign back and is graded PSA 4 This is a very nice card. \n\nI am asking $ 230 for the card. I prefer to be paid with a US Postal money order. But if that is a problem, I will accept PayPal or a check.\n\nIf you would like to buy it, you can contact me at: [url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-090b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-090rb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks.\n\nCy",
