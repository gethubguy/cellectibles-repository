I don't care if they're trimmed, and all I prefer is that the fronts are presentable. I don't mind marks, miscuts, or small amounts of paper loss on the back. I would prefer them raw, as I'll be cracking them out anyways.\n\nE-mail is best:\n\n[url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\n\n\n\n.",
