      "post_content": "Lot of 5 T206 southern leaguers.  Revelle, Ryan, Howard, Persons, Coles. Only those 5 for sale.  Please check scans for condition.  The Coles has an erased pencil mark near the top, hard to pick up via scans. $310 shipped for the lot.  These will be shipped from Canada so they may be held up at customs and take up to a few weeks for delivery.  Email with any interest.  I haven't been active since the old board as far as selling/posting so ask around if you must.
