      "post_content": "Hey everyone.. looking to sell my T206 Hindu Greminger. It has a back stamp which says: \"Fredrick Benedict Gessner\"... I have seen a few of these back stamps before.. not sure if anyone here is trying to collect them.\n\nThe card has no creases on the front or back.... front presents in VG condition.. The back has paperloss and the back stamp which is the cause for the SGC 10 grade.\n\n$325 for the card.. I will pay for shipping and insurance.\n[IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/3-4_zpsf8b3ff52.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/2-4_zpsbf6a1318.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/4-3_zps1e0b05e0.jpg[/IMG]",
