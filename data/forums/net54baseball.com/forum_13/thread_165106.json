I'm also interested in trading for it, too, if you'd rather go that route.\n\nI have a nice 1915 Cracker Jack Marquard SGC 60 and 1916 Famous & Barr Wheat PSA 2 I can use in the trade, too.\n\nJimi",

Here is a link to scans so you can look at them.\n[url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/Texxxx/t206-duplicates/60[/url]\nThe second one looks the best to me except for the small paper loss on back at bottom.\nIf your interested, send me some scans of the Marquard.
