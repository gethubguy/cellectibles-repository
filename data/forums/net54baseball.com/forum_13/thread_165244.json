There are currently no graded McIntyre (Brooklyn & Chicago) Cycle 460's on either the PSA or SGC pop reports.\n\nPlease contact me if you have a Cycle 460 with a low population that you would consider possibly trading. \n\n[url]mmw2161@aol.com[/url]\n\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\n\nJerry",
