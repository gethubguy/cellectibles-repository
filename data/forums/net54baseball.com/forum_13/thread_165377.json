There are a ton of these cards that get sold and almost none that look great. (forget technical grade). I bet if I showed you a strong looking Young with near 50/50 centering, sharper corners, but a touch of paper loss on a blank area on the back, you would consider it...even if in a 2 holder?  Good luck in the quest. I won't heckle you again (yet) :).",
