      "post_content": "Hello everyone.  I've officially hit the wall and finally believe I am done with the hobby.  I'll be breaking up the cards by type, overall not a whole heck of a lot, and posting on the NET54 B/S/T boards over the course of the week.  I figure I got a few of the cards on here so I may as well give them a shot here again and keep them \"in the group\" before I go elsewhere.  Paypal/postal money orders preferred.  All prices are delivered and please feel free to ask me any questions.  Thanks!\n\nGroup Photos below.\n\nIndividual card front/back scans can be found here:\n[url]http://s121.beta.photobucket.com/user/billcauley/library/For%20Sale[/url]\n\nT204\nJake Stahl  SGC 30/2 $130\n\nT205 \nChristy Mathewson SGC A $200\n\nT206\nRube Marquard Portrait PSA 2.5 $90\nRube Waddell Portrait   PSA 2   SOLD \n\nFrank Arellanes SGC 10/1 $35\nMordecai Brown (Portrait) SGC 40/3 $220 \nBill Carrigan SGC 40/3 $45\nEd Cicotte SGC 30/2 $90\nWalter Johnson (Portrait) SGC 10/1 $250(PENDING)\nRed Kleinow Old Mill (Boston) SGC 20/1.5 $115\nNap Lajoie (Portrait) SGC 40/3  SOLD \nHarry Lord SGC 50/4 SOLD \nChristy Mathewson (Portrait) SGC 30/2 SOLD\nJohn McGraw (Finger in Air) SGC 10/1 $55\nHarry Niles  SGC 30/2 $35\nTris Speaker SGC 30/2 SOLD \nTubby Spencer SGC 20/1.5 $35\nJake Stahl (Glove Shows) SGC 30/2 $30\nJake Stahl (No Glove) SGC 10/1 $33\nBob Unglaub SGC 30/2 $30\nHeinie Wagner (Bat Right) SGC 10/1 $30\nHeinie Wagner (Bat Left) SGC 30/2 $30\nCy Young (Portrait) SGC 30/2 $600\n\n[IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0006_zpsea25ade6.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0005_zps2f845af1.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0004_zps24250e59.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0003_zps4fcadab9.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0007_zps71f9c46f.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/BothStahl_zpsd19e1856.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o237/billcauley/AllT_0002_zpsf51af9b7.jpg[/IMG]",
