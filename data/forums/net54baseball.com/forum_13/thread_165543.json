      "post_content": "I was looking through my T206 Boston AL team set that I have mounted in my bathroom and noticed the Tubby Spencer has a brown Hndu back.  Before selling the Hindu I'd like to replace the Spencer so I don't have a hole in my framed set.  Does anyone have a presentable (nice G or VG) T206 Spencer you could sell me at a reasonable price (or trade me)?\n\nMy tradeable cards are located at:\n[url]www.imageevent.com/brailey[/url]\n\nWhile I'm at it I'm also looking for \nN300 Brouthers Louisville \nN300 Russie\nT207 Bushelman\nE90-1 Speaker\nT206 George Davis with Sovereign 350 back \nT3 Clarke\nT3 Carrigan\nM116 Hall\nM116 Wood\n2009 Topps 206 Gold Mini / 50 Mathewson, Gehrig, Mantle\n2010 Topps 206 Gold Mini / 50 Mathewson, Cobb, Chance, Evers.\n24 different T204's (see my want list on my for sale site).\n\nThanks,\nMike \nE-mail:  [url]mikebrailey@yahoo.com[/url]",
