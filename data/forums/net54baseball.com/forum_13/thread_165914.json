      "post_content": "I've owned this card for about 15yrs.  The full-color example is not mine (just showing it for contrast) and I apologize for the odd cropping, couldn't figure out how to blend them properly.\n\nAs you can see, the red, pink, brown, etc is missing.  He's nearly white as a ghost.  The scan is huge and it make the creasing appear more pronounced than it really is.  The back is a clean Piedmont 150 (shown below)\n\nI've recieved a variety of inputs as to value on this one - really anywhere from $100 - $1200+.  The card is for sale.  Please let me know if you have an interest and an offer.  I don't need top dollar on this card, but think it's valuable and very unique.  PM me or email me.  Thanks in advance.\n\nBest,\nCraig",
