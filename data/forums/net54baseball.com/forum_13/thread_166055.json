      "post_content": "Good Luck with your search.  In the 10 years I have been following the Cycle 460s backs I have only seen 2 for sale.  I know there is more out there but I know one is in a collection that is not going any where and the other was in a 2 holder, can't remember the company that was trimmed, I think it got cracked out, but other than those 2 if there out there they are in collections.  \n\nIt is one of the 21 I still need to finish my Cycle 460 subset.\n\nJust a little info for you, sometimes there are cards out there we would like to have but are very difficult to find and then find someone that is willing to sell.\n\nGood Luck\n\nLee",
