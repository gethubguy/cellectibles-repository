      "post_content": "Hi all.  Im looking to rebuild my Hall of Fame collection (at least a bit) and Im looking for the cards below in low grade condition.  General eye appeal is preferred, but these wont be super sharp cards.  Graded is nice, but not a requirement.  Most any back will do, but the ultra rare backs will likely be out of my budget.\n\nAll are T206s\n\nTy Cobb - red portrait\nWalter Johnson - any version\nChristy Mathewson - prefer black hat but consider any version\nCy Young - prefer green port., but consider any version\n\nPM or email me with any options.  Thanks!",
