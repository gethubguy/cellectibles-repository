      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nT206 Ira Thomas - PSA-5  American Beauty - of five graded, this is by far the highest graded example (others are A, 1, 2, 2.5).\n\nPrices on these have really gone up.  Last night in Goodwin, a PSA-4 Downs went for $1,952 and an SGC 60 Leifield went for $691.  A few days ago on Ebay, a Dygert in PSA-4 went for $953.\n\n$SOLD.  Thanks!\n\nThanks much,\nCraig",
