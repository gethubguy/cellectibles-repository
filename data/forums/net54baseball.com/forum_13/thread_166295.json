      "post_content": "Just got this card back from PSA as being not graded do to it not meeting the minimum size requirements. Looks to be a tad smaller than other T210's I have seen, but this card was purchased, along with others, from the estate of a 90 year old gentleman. I really dont think it was trrimmed, but just a bit shorter, for whatever reason.\n\nAnyway, as I cannot get this card graded, I am selling it raw for $40 dlvd. If you have a raw set, and dont care about grading, this card is perfect for you. Gorgeous color and eye appeal\n\n$40 dlvd\n\n[IMG]http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff450/wcsportscards/001-7_zps99991862.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff450/wcsportscards/002-6_zps99b2695c.jpg[/IMG]",
