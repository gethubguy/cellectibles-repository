      "post_content": "Looking to trade this card for a T206 Highlander with a similar back. Does not have to be an AB 350 NF, but something in the same scarcity  neighborhood would probably work best. Cycle 460, AB460 etc....\n\nNot opposed to some cash going one way or the other depending on the card/back that would be included in the deal, but I do not want to sell it outright at the moment. LMK if you have anything that could be a match.\n\nThanks!\n\n[IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/ElberfeldAB350NF_zpsf5a0031d.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/ElberfeldAB350NFBack_zps52e05fae.jpg[/IMG]",
