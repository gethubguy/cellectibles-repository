      "post_content": "I made this as a prototype a few years ago, never really used it. \n\nIt's about 12x 6 x8 inches. Built very solidly of oak with an oak plywood floor. \nInside it's got around 10 inches of space.\nSo it will fit 40 SGC slabs, a few more PSA a few fewer Beckett. \nRealistically you wouldn't want to put 40 in there as they'd be hard to remove. I figure around 35 SGC slabs would be the most that would be practical.\n\nNice for smaller collections or just a place to put a few cards on the desk. \n\n$45 shipped in the US. International would get expensive but I'll ship it pretty much anywhere at cost.(US shipping is priority large flat rate, 16.85)  \n\nI'm planning on making a few more if this sells, probably a bit lighter, and without the brass plate (And a bit nicer, I've gotten much better since I made this one.)\n\n\nSteve B\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.mindspring.com/~sblackstone/box1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.mindspring.com/~sblackstone/box2.jpg[/IMG]",
