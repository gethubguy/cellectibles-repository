      "post_content": "When I became active on N54, I was all about the name on top cards and then the two namers.  Well, as I get closer to completing my SGC40 set and since I've been dabbling in EPDGs, my love for the name on toppers has begun to fade.  My money is spread too thin across three collections, so I think this is the one that loses out, which does sadden me.\n\nI've got a pretty nice collection of 38, most of which can be seen in my registry:\n[url]http://sgccardregistry.com/gallery.aspx?cat=1&set=239&userset=5911[/url]\n\nThe highlights are:\n[S]Cobb Bat On[/S] - TRADED\n[S]Evers Portrait[/S] - SOLD\nTinker Hands On Knee (was a PSA 3MC)\n[S]Chase Dark Cap (Tolstoi)[/S] - TRADED\nEddie Collins\n[S]Walsh[/S] - SOLD\nGandil (Tolstoi)\n[S]Jennings Both Hands[/S] - SOLD\n\nThe others:\nArndt\nBescher Hands In Air\n[S]Bransfield[/S] - SOLD\nByrne\nCampbell (Old Mill)\n[S]Clancy[/S] - TRADED\nDavidson\n[S]Dooin[/S] - TRADED\nDoyle With Bat (Tolstoi)\nHannifan (ungraded)\nHayden\nHowell\nJordan Portrait\n[S]Kleinow NY With Bat[/S] - SOLD\nLake Ball In Hand (ungraded Old Mill, severely trimmed)\nLatham \n[S]McGlynn[/S] - TRADED\nMitchell\n[S]Moriarty[/S] - TRADED\nNeedham\nPfeffer\n[S]Phillippe[/S] - SOLD\nPowell\nSchaeffer Washington\nSchlei Batting\n[S]Seymour Batting[/S] - TRADED\nHappy Smith\nHeinie Smith\nLee Tannehill L. On Front\nIrv Young\n\nI plan on keeping my three Rossmans, but the others I'd like to move as a single lot.  Looking for offers at the moment.  I might consider selling singles if the offers are right.",
