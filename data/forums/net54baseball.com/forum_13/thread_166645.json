      "post_content": "I'm putting this out here for any interest, sale or trade, make me an offer. First is a Kisinger with two full factories, one on top, one on bottom. I apologize for the pics, when I tried to scan it, the plastic holder inside the psa case kept leaving a glare right over the top factory, even when I put something there to block it. So I got out the old flip phone(see shadows) and took two crappy pics, best I could do without putting my fist through my scanner. The card is very tall but nothing extra from another card is on the front.  Price added on bottom, trades still considered",
