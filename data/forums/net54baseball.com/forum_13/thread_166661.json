      "post_content": "Guys...........For sale is this t206 Ty Cobb with a Polar Bear back that has been given the 'Authentic' designation by PSA due to the lower border being trimmed. It's hard to see in the image, but the lower right border is angled just slightly starting under 'Detroit'. The card also has a couple other creases near the bottom, some staining in the upper left corner and rear scrap book removal issues. The card still displays nice with great color (deeper and better in person...my scanner is subpar), a clear image and pretty good centering. Price is $SOLD delivered in a box via Priority Mail. Payment by Paypal 'gift' preferred. PM me or email me at mattpienta at yahoo dot com with questions or to purchase. Thanks.........Matt\n\nCard is SOLD.",
