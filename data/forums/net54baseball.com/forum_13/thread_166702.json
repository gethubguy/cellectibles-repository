      "post_content": "I'm working on a t206 HOFer back run. Below is a list of what I still need.  The plan is to \"bump\" this thread each time I add a new back with a HOFer.\n\nI can't afford mid to high grade HOFers with tough backs, so probably nothing higher than a 3 depending on the HOFer.  I'm going to be selling a few HOFers to help fund these cards (so look for those posts coming later today) or I can use some of them for trade bait.  I don't have much in the way of rare stuff to trade, but I do have a nice selection of lots of brands from 1909 to about 1935 and newer depending if you are interested. \n\nWHAT HOF BACK I NEED:\nAB 350 (Frame)\nAB 350 (No Frame)\nAB 460 - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nBlank Back\nBroad Leaf 350\nBroad Leaf 460\nCarolina Brights\nDrum\nEPDG - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nHindu Brown\nHindu Red\nLenox Brown\nOld Mill Black SL\nOld Mill Brown SL\nP150\nPiedy 42\nPolar Bear - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nSovereign 150\nSovereign 350 Forest Green\nSovereign 350 Apple Green\nSovereign 460 - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nSC150 #649\nSC350 #25\nSC350-460 #25 - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nSC350-460 #30 - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nSC350-460 #42\nSC350-460 #42 (overprint) - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nTolstoi - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nUzit - Need ONLY McGraw Portrait w/ Cap\nTy Cobb (LOL yeah right!)  :)\n\nLet me know what you have!  Thanks!\n\nJimi",

I'm working on a McGraw Portrait w/ Cap back run and filling in the gaps with other HOFers on the backs that do not coincide with the McGraws that I need.  \n\nI have lots to trade, and I would welcome the possibility of unloading some of my \"Top Ten\" cards in order to get what I need including my '51B Mantle RC, e106 Collins, n172 Comiskey, e95 Plank, V61 Cobb, w511 Ruth, and others especially if I can get some tougher backs along the way.\n\nLMK!  \nJimi",
