      "post_content": "This is another card from a collection I'm selling that was tucked away for the past 30-40 years by an old-school collector who cared little to nothing about third-party grading, Internet chat boards and/or set registries. \n\nFor an issue whose cards are prone to condition problems, this example looks pretty nice. Biggest flaw is a corner crease in the upper-left, which actually blends into the background when you're looking at the card in-hand. The clarity of the photo is above average for T200 team cards. Also, the edges have for the most part been spared the chipping often seen on these cards.\n\nIt should go without saying, but given the level of quality of recent posts on the main board, I'll say it anyway: This card pictures Hall of Famer Nap Lajoie and non-Hall of Famer Joe Jackson.\n\nPrice is $xxx delivered within the United States.\n\nCheck or money order preferred; PayPal is OK.\n\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes: \n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]",
