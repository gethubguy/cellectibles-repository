      "post_content": "Anyone looking for a group of SGC cards in lower grades?\n\nCan sell a group, anywhere from 10-30 or more, of SGC cards. I am thinking for standard commons per card pricing:\n\nSGC\n10: $22\n20: $26\n30: $32\n\nTougher commons, HOFers, SL etc will vary on prices. If you have an interest within these parameters, shoot me an email (no PMs) with either a want list or I can send a list of what I have.\n\nI may be out a bit today (Tuesday) so will respond this afternoon/evening.\n\nThanks - Rob\n[url]rgutheil@gmail.com[/url]",
