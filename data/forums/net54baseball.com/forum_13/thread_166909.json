This particular player makes many collector's \"top 10\" lists in terms of most difficult t207s to try to find.\n\nDonnelly looks very nice on the front with only a couple thin wrinkles.  The back has some scraping and a few areas where someone tried to handwrite the words in with a black pen.  \n\nAsking $160 delivered....thanks in advance,\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95412&d=1365638738[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95413&d=1365638752[/IMG]",
