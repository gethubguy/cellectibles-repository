Devlin is stained, no creases. Perring has a heavy crease on his right shoulder and a small crease above that on the left border. Dunn has 2 small corner creases in upper right corner. Downey has a polar Bear back with a small crease at the bottom. $100 delivered for the group.\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95598&d=1365798024[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95599&d=1365798034[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95600&d=1365798043[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95601&d=1365798052[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=95602&d=1365798061[/IMG]",
