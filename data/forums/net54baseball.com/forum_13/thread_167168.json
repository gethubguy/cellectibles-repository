      "post_content": "I have a raw Carolina Brights Hartsel for sale. The card has two spots of paper stuck on the front. There is also some light surface discoloration (light purple) which is probably from the source of the paper. The card has light corner wear and is crease free. The back is in great shape. The spots may soak off but that is obviously nothing I can guarantee. The spot on the left looks like some of the paper was removed. The price is SOLD shipped and insured. Paypal or check is fine. Email is the best way to reach me with questions. Committment to buy takes precedence over offers. I will be listing a few more cards in the days to come.\n                                            Thanks,\n                                             Steve",
