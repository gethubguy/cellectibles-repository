      "post_content": "Not something you see every day - very decent lot of 88 different graded  T207's.   Want to move these cards as a lot - they'll be going to an auction house if there's no interest, or the swarm of T206 posts knock it off the front page.\n\n[URL=\"http://imageevent.com/gspinf/forsaletrade/t207starterset\"]Card images are here[/URL]. Also have available a [URL=\"http://photos.imageevent.com/gspinf/forsaletrade/t207starterset/StarterSet.xls\"]spreadsheet with all cards[/URL].  Average grade of these cards is just a shade under SGC 45 - there are very few slouches in the lot.  You'll see these come up at the auction houses from time to time, but rarely in this  overall condition.  If you know T207's, I think this lot speaks for itself.\n\nIncluded are some tough cards:\n\n15 Broadleaf class cards, including:\n\n\n  * Donnelly - SGC 35\n  * Kutina - SGC 50 (Louisiana Find)\n  * Miller (Otto) - SGC 40\n  * Moore - SGC 40\n  * Sweeney - SGC 30\n  * Tyler - SGC 20\n  * Wilson (Pitt) - PSA3 (MK)\n  * ...\n\n\nVarious difficult Recruit class cards - either scarcity or grade/scarcity\n\n\n  * Barry- SGC 60\n  * Block - SGC 30\n  * Carrigan - SGC 30\n  * Fromme - SGC 50 (very tough in this grade)\n  * Higgins - PSA 2.5\n  * Livingston \"A\" - SGC 30\n  * R. Morgan - SGC 35\n  * Perdue - SGC 40\n  * Schardt - SGC 40\n  * Schulte - PSA 5\n  * Scott - SGC A\n  * Stovall - SGC 40\n  * Sullivan - SGC 30\n  * ...\n\n\nGrade breakdown:\n\n  * SGC 60 - 11\n  * SGC 50 - 18\n  * SGC 45 - 1\n  * SGC 40 - 19\n  * SGC 35 - 2\n  * SGC 30 - 8\n  * SGC 20 - 3\n  * SGC A - 2\n\n\n  * PSA 6 - 2 (1 MC)\n  * PSA 5 - 6 (1 MC)\n  * PSA 4 - 6\n  * PSA 3.5 - 1\n  * PSA 3 - 3 (1 MK)\n  * PSA 2.5 - 1\n  * PSA 2 - 1\n  * PSA 1.5 - 1\n  * PSA 1 - 3\n\n\nAsking $9500.  PM, email if interested - thanks for looking.\n\n--\nMike",

I suspect offering the entire set for that price would draw few responses beyond yourselves and a few notable others.\n\nCards available as lot till 5/7/2013.\n--\nMike",
