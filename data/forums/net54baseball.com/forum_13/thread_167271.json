      "post_content": "Have a large number of 1909 Obaks I'm parting with today.  Players and prices are listed below.  I made a note next to each player for any horizontal poses or handcut variations as well. \n\nAlso, I measured each card by hand and if the card measures short, I mention that next to the player.  Many of these are indeed handcut variations and those measurements can vary somewhat.\n\nScans are available upon request and all prices include shipping.  \n\nThanks guys,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n****As of May 1, Updated List Below....****",

Discounts considered for multiple purchases. Updated prices listed above...\n\nPlus, for the first person who buys any card and requests it, I'll throw in a free Martinke horizontal! This is the rare variation of him trying to catch, uhhh, what appears to be a 2-liter of Coca-cola! \n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=96701&d=1366489469[/IMG]",
