      "post_content": "I am refocusing my collecting efforts more towards pre-war NY Highlanders (where possible), and for minor league issues San Francisco Seals or Texas teams.  Therefore I have placed all of my for sale/for trade into a photo album under my profile.  I have also placed a link below.  Each card has a price and/or trade.  If it is noted for trade without a price, I am interested in trading for New York Highlanders from that same type.\n\nFurther, if you have an offer on any other items in my albums cash or trade wise, I am always willing to entertain offers!\n\nIf you are interested, please email me at [url]cooper1927@yahoo.com[/url] or PM me.  Prices for cards are PayPal Family and Friends and includes shipping.\n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/album.php?albumid=325[/url]",
