      "post_content": "Sorry about the eclectic mix of cards, but I am looking to unload the entire lot of HOFers to help with some purchases coming up.  Looking for all reasonable offers.  I'm not planning on playin' around....just a nice quick easy sale.  This would be a great opportunity for a HOF Collector, a card flipper, or someone setting up at a table.\n\n**I must add that a handful of these have already been previously offered up in other BST threads that I posted and a few BINs on EBAY that I placed.  If something happens to where those cards would \"disappear\" from this list below, I will indicate that.  HOWEVER, I am hoping this lot will go fast.  Thanks so much for helping me out, folks!!\n\nRoberto Alomar1988Score Traded #105TPSA 9RC\nWalter Alston1956Topps #8 grayraw - GOODRC\nLuis Aparicio1956Topps #292raw - EX (oc)RC\nEd Barrow1953-63Artvue HOF Postcard Type 2raw - EXMT\nChief Bender1910e98 BLUESGC 10\nJim Bottomley1933Goudey #44PSA 3\nLou Boudreau1948Leaf #106PSA 3\nGeorge Brett 1975Topps #228raw - EXRC\nMordecai Brown1911t201 Mecca Cigarettes Double FoldersSGC 20\nRay Brown1972Puerto Rican Baseballraw - MINT\nJim Bunning1957Topps #338raw - EX (MK)RC\nRoy Campanella1953Bowman Color #46raw - GOOD\nSteve Carlton1965Topps #477PSA 3RC\nGary Carter1975Topps #620raw - VGEXRC\nAlexander Cartwright1944-52Albertype HOF Postcardraw - EXMT\nOrlando Cepeda1958Topps #343raw - VGEXRC\nHenry Chadwick1950CallahanPSA 7\nNestor Chylak1955Bowman #283raw - VGEXRC\nFred Clarke1910e98 REDSGC AUT\nEddie Collins 1911t205 Hassan 30 (mouth closed)SGC 40\nJocko Conlan1955Bowman #303raw - GOOD\nKiki Cuyler1933DeLong #8PSA 1.5\nRay Dandridge1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars #26raw - NRMT\nDizzy Dean1934Butterfingerraw - P/F\nEd Delahanty1950-54Callahanraw - VGEX\nMartin Dihigo1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars #29raw - EXMT\nDon Drysdale1957Topps #18raw - VGRC\nLeo Durocher1951Bowman #233SGC 50\nDennis Eckersley1975SSPC #506PSA 9RC\nRed Faber1929R316 Kashin PublicationsSGC 30\nRick Ferrell1933Goudey #218SGC 30\nRollie Fingers1969Topps #597PSA 7RC\nCarlton Fisk1972Topps #79PSA 5RC\nWhitey Ford1951Berk Ross #4-5raw - GOODRC\nFord Frick1959Topps #1raw - VGEX\nFrankie Frisch1921Exhibitsraw -P/F\nWarren Giles1956Topps #2raw - GOODRC\nJoe Gordon1948Leaf #117raw - FAIR\nGoose Goslin1927York CaramelPSA 2.5\nGoose Gossage1973Topps #174raw - EXMTRC\nTony Gwynn1983Topps #482SGC 86RC\nWill Harridge1956Topps #1raw - PoorRC\nBucky Harris1936R313 National Chicle raw - poor\n Rickey Henderson1980Topps #482raw - NRMTRC\nWhitey Herzog1957Topps #29SGC 80RC\nCal Hubbard1955Bowman #315raw - VG\nCatfish Hunter1965Topps #526raw - F/GRC\nFerguson Jenkins1966Topps #254raw - VGRC\nAl Kaline1957Topps #125raw - VGEX\nGeorge Kelly1928Harrington\u2019s Ice Creamraw - F/G\nChuck Klein1939Play Ball #82BVG 4.5\nBowie Kuhn1977Padres Schedule Cardsraw - NRMT\nKenesaw Landis1950-56Callahanraw - EXMT\nBarry Larkin1986Sportslics #34raw - MINTRC\nBob Lemon1952Topps #268raw - G/VG\nBuck Leonard1981HOF MetallicSGC JSA AUT\nPop Lloyd1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars #33raw - NRMT\nErnie Lombardi1936R312raw - VG\nHeinie Manush1935Diamond Stars #30SGC 50\nJuan Marichal1961Topps #417raw - VGEXRC\nEddie Mathews1954Topps #30raw - poor\nBill Mazeroski1957Topps #24raw - VGEXRC\nJose Mendez1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars #9raw - NRMT\nPaul Molitor1978Topps #707raw - EXMTRC\nJoe Morgan1965Topps #16raw - VGEXRC\nEddie Murray1978Topps #36raw - VGEXRC\nPhil Niekro1964Topps #541raw - F/GRC\nTony Perez1965Topps #581raw - VGEXRC\nGaylord Perry1962Topps #199raw - VGEXRC\nJim Rice1975Topps #616raw - VGEXRC\nCal Ripken1982Donruss #405raw - NRMTRC\nRobin Roberts1949Bowman #46raw - poorRC\nBrooks Robinson1960Topps #28raw - GOOD\nFrank Robinson1957Topps #35PSA 3RC\nWilbert Robinson1916M101-4 Sporting News #144SGC 30\nEdd Roush1931W517 #3raw - F/G\nNolan Ryan1975Topps HL #5raw - EX\nRyne Sandberg1983Fleer #507raw - NRMTRC\nRon Santo1961Topps #35raw - EXRC\nMike Schmidt1973Topps #615raw - VGEXRC\nRed Schoendienst1945M114 Baseball Magazine PostersBVG AUTORC\nTom Seaver1968Topps #45raw - EXMT\nAl Simmons1935Diamond Stars #2SGC 20\nGeorge Sisler1921ExhibitsSGC 10\nBillly Southworth1951Bowman #207raw - EXMT (ST)\nWarren Spahn1957Topps #90raw - VGEX\nWillie Stargell1964Topps #342raw - VGEX (oc)\nCasey Stengel1952Bowman #181raw - VG (MK)\nBruce Sutter1977Topps #144raw - VGEXRC\nDon Sutton1966Topps #288raw - VGRC\nBill Terry 1934Goudey #53SGC 10\nCristobal Torriente1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Stars #18raw - NRMT\nPie Traynor1936R313 National ChicleSGC 30\nDazzy Vance1929R316 Kashin Publicationsraw - EX (MK)\nBill Veeck1949Indians Team Issue Picture Pakraw - VGEX\nBobby Wallace1909e90-1raw - F/G\nEarl Weaver1969Topps #516raw - EXRC\nBilly Williams1961Topps #141raw - VGEXRC\nDick Williams1953Topps #125raw - F/G\nJud Wilson1974Laughlin Old-Time Black Starsraw - EXRC\nDave Winfield1974Topps #456PSA 7RC\nEarly Wynn1943M114 Baseball Magazine PostersBVG 3RC\nRobin Yount1975Topps #228raw - VGEXRC",

I can do $2,400 on the lot, an average of $22.64 per card.  I think this is a great deal. If you start adding them up, you'll see the kind of value that is there.  If I have no takers in the next couple of days, I'll just finish selling them off individually on here or EBAY.  I'm not in a rush, but I was just hoping to move on without putting forth too much effort.  :)",
