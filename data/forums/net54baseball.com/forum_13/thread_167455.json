      "post_content": "I have this small lot of 14 raw, low grade T205 cards that I would like to trade.  I had started on the set at one time but haven't added to them in a long while, and have decided it is too hard to complete both this and the T206 set at the same time.  So, I would like to trade these 14 cards for however many T206 cards that I can get, I am not too picky.  I would prefer to trade them for a smaller quantity of similar grade SGC slabbed T206 Commons (maybe 6 or 7), or perhaps a couple low grade T206 Hall of Famers.  Or, I would take a reasonable cash price for them and just buy a few more T206's that I am looking for.  Please PM me if interested.\nBest,\nJeff",
