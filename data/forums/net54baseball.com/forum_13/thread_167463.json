      "post_content": "Got this beauty up for grabs today. It's Bridwell's name on top and bottom.  The image is very clear in person.  I'm terrible with my scanner, but I can guarantee it looks WAY better in person!  :)  I'm a HOF collector, so this doesn't fit in the collection.  I'm up for offers on it, or t206 HOFers in trade.  I'm starting a McGraw portrait w/ cap back run as well, so that's also an option.  LMK!\n\nJimi",
