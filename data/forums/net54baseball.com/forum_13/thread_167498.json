      "post_content": "I am contemplating TRADING some of my signed tobacco cards Most are T205 which I think are rarer than T206. All are slabbed and most were gotten in trades from Paul (T206 collector). I do not have to time to post scans though if we work out a tentative deal I will send a scan before we finalize.\nIn trade I would want signed slabbed cards of HOFers of equal value that I need. Feel free to offer signed harder to get cards from 1909-1942 of HOFers as I need quite a few. \nOnly post- 1942 I might want are certain Mays, mantle, Clemente, J. robinson and Campy and Satchel on original topps and Bowman, Southworth (51 Bowman), 54 B Ted Williams, 61 Fleer- Cobb, Traynor/Sisler (#89), 60 Fleer Cobb 61 NuCard Scoops- Cochrane, J. Robinson, campy, Cobb\nHere is what I have- T205- Bridwell, Carrigan, Doye, Jones, Leach, Parent, Snodgrass\nE91 McBride\nT206 Parent, Snodgrass\nEmail [url]theshleps@aol.com[/url]. Not thinking of selling unless it is such an outrageous off I can't turn it down. Much rather trade",
