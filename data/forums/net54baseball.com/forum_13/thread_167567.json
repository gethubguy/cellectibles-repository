      "post_content": "This is a rare front/back combo. An old thread on here, with tons of research behind it, said that approx 1 in 25 Lundgren Chicago's come with this back. 24 out of 25 come with Piedmont 150 and good luck finding the couple EPDG's out there. I checked ebay and all nine that have sold, have 150 backs. One active one has excessive back damage, so all I could tell is that it was a Piedmont. The grade is SGC 10, but where ya gonna find another...if you know, keep that to yourself! :)\n\n  So the question is, who has something good to trade for it. Cash can be good if there is enough, but be creative here! Errors, miscuts, crop marks, sheet numbers, all considered",
