Don't want a complete beater, and I generally shy away from trimmed cards.  \nShoot me an email at lukealyon@gmail with scans/pics and a price if you have one for sale.  I can do paypal or check/money order.  \nThe last time I started a thread like this, I was looking for a Walter Johnson Portrait for around $300, with the same aesthetic parameters.  I ended up buying this one for $395, and I couldn't be happier with it.  I'm just including the scans as an example of what I'm looking for.  \n\nThanks for looking!\nLuke",
