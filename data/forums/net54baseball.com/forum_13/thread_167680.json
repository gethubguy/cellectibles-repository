      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm offering a freshly dressed up T207 Lee Tannehill framed and matted in a 4x6\" frame madE by myself.\n\nThe frame is made from a Comiskey Park seat bottom slat that I had-cut, routed and put together myself. It is comes with a COA from myself stating how it was made and numbered 6 of 8 in first series of these that I did. It also will come with a COA from Authentic Stadium Seats where I bought the seat bottom. All materials are archival and a UV blocking sheet had been put between Mr. Tannehill and the glass. \n\nThe card itself is in PR/FR condition with some paper loss but please see photos to draw your own condition conclusion. \n\nAsking $90.00 paypal or best offer... Please see photos and ask questions.\nI have other stadium frames in 5x7 and 8x10 sizes...\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=97133&d=1366854181[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=97134&d=1366854263[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=97131&d=1366854144[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=97132&d=1366854158[/IMG]",
