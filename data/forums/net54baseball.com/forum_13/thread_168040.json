I don't care what set they're from, if they're $5 commons or high-end, $1000+ HOFers, graded or ungraded, if you have anything, I'm interested!\n\nPM or email [url]poorlydrawncat@gmail.com[/url]\n\nHere are some examples from my collection that illustrate what I'm talking about:\n\n[URL=http://imgur.com/IwgPLWv][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IwgPLWv.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mZSHuLS.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/WlZiB0P.png[/IMG]",
