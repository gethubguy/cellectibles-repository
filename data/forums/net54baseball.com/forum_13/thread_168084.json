      "post_content": "I have 30 T205s for sale that were pasted in a scrapbook.All are common players. Most have the scrapbook paper still on the back but a few have paper loss. They are in varying conditions with most having strong eye appeal. Fronts range from good condition to vgex. All have little or no chipping on the borders. I'm having trouble uploading pics from my IPhone so email if interested and I can send the pics over. Price on the lot is SOLD\n                                           Thanks,\n                                              Steve",
