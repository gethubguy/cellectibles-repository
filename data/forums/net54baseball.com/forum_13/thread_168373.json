      "post_content": "I made these for my own use because I didn't like the way T-cards looked flopping around in a top load, the little toploads flopped around in the box and I can't even imagine how much room a fully slabbed t206 set would take up...these are a glossy stock, blank backed, which I preferred so I could write information about the card (price, where I got it). Anyhow, I just needed to order a new bunch and have enough to last me quite a while, so I thought I would float it out there to see if anyone was interested.  20 cents each, $20/100 plus a couple bucks postage.  Fit nicely in a standard topload...you can store an entire T206 set in a couple of photo boxes. Makes not so nice cards look pretty presentable.",
