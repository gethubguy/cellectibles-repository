The BST is a great place for many different collectors to do just that: Buy, sell, or trade. \n\nBy bumping so often, whether it is intended or not, and you may have been doing it with absence of consideration as versus an intent to bring it to the top of the page, you are essentially communicating that the other threads are not as important as yours. You are certainly not the only one doing this, however... Frequently you will see one user that has 5 threads simultaneously for only 5 different cards, and bump all 5 of them every day or so for a week.\n\nReally not a huge deal at all in the scheme of things, but it can be frustrating (understandably so) for people that put a lot of time into their posts, but only get a few hours of activity because they aren't bumped constantly.\n\nEdited to say that they are, however, some great Hindu examples!",
