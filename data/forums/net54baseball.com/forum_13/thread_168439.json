      "post_content": "Looking for an alternative way to safely store and/or more easily transport graded cards and packs than the white cardboard boxes many of us are so familiar with? Then look no further.\n\nI have teamed with Matt Miller to commercialize the custom graded card cases that he had been producing from time to time over the past few years. We are now pleased to announce the availability of FOUR (4) models of Card Vault graded card storage/transportation cases.\n\nIF YOU HAVE INTEREST IN A TALL BOY SIZED MODEL, PLEASE SEND A PM AND WE'LL SEE IF WE THERE IS ENOUGH INTEREST TO DO A MINIMUM QUANTITY RUN IN THAT SIZE.\n\n[IMG]http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m493/70ToppsFanatic/ClosedCase_zpsbaddad21.jpg[/IMG]\n\nCases are shipped to you directly via economy shipping (usually UPS Ground in the USA).  We are currently accepting orders for delivery in August (immediately after National).  Orders can be placed by sending me a PM.  Please include the case model(s) and quantities desired, your name/address details, and email address.  An invoice for your order will be generated and sent to you via email.  \n\nWe can supply Card Vault cases to customers outside the USA, but shipping costs need to be worked out for each international order (import duties and taxes are the responsibility of the purchaser for international orders).\n\nEach Card Vault graded card storage/transportation case is a watertight, crushproof, dust proof polyethylene case (see pictures below).  Each model comes with a custom-designed foam insert to hold either standard size graded cards from PSA, SGC, GAI, Beckett, etc. or standard size graded packs.  We are also working individually with collectors and dealers looking for non-standard sized graded card cases (Tall Boys, Tickets, etc.) on a custom order basis.\n\nSelecting the right size Card Vault(s) is easy. We have:\n\n- a hand-carried model that can be used for both storage and small-scale transportation\n\n- a maximum capacity model that will meet the needs of larger volume collectors and dealers\n\n- a wheeled model with a pull-out handle for those who regularly move larger volumes of graded cards\n  (and since its crushproof, it also doubles as a convenient seat with a back rest so you can sit down at tables)\n\n- a graded pack model that accomodates the larger slabs (width, height and thickness of pack slabs)\n\nWe've made some refinements in the case design such that all Card Vault cases now come with the lid-insert STANDARD without additional cost.  And all Card Vault graded card storage/transportation cases come with a Lifetime Warranty from the case manufacturer. Replacement foam inserts are also available for purchase for existing customers.\n\nHere are the specifications and pricing for the current standard models.\n\nModel 200: Collector Card Vault\n\n[IMG]http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m493/70ToppsFanatic/CardVault200250-Open_zpsf8ac298e.png[/IMG]\n\nPrice: $250/case + economy shipping\n\nHolds approximately 225-250* standard-sized PSA cards in 4 rows. Meets all airline requirements for carry-on usage. A dual-purpose case that can be used for slightly easier to handle storage (i.e., less \u201cloaded\u201d weight) or as a hand-held carrier to securely transport up to a few hundred cards.\n\nL x W x H (ID) 18.5\" x 13\" x 7\"\nLid / Base 1.5 + 5.5\"\nMaterial Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)\nATA Rated Yes\nPadlockable Yes\nHandles Snap-down rubber over-molded handle\nLatches \"Trigger Release\" latch system\nWheels No\nColor Black\nWater Resistance Watertight, crushproof, and dust proof (MIL-C-4150J)\nEmpty Weight 6.6 lbs.\n\n\nModel 300: Set-Builder Card Vault\n\n[IMG]http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m493/70ToppsFanatic/CardVault300-Open_zpsa716c485.png[/IMG]\n\nPrice: $300/case + economy shipping\n\nHolds approximately 375-400* standard-sized PSA cards in 5 rows. Pictured without lid insert. Ideal for registry set builders and large volume dealers looking for the optimal combination of secure waterproof storage, maximum capacity and durability.\n\nL x W x H (ID) 22\" x 17\" x 8\"\nLid / Base (ID) 2 + 6\"\nMaterial Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)\nATA Rated Yes\nPadlockable Yes\nHandles Snap-down rubber over-molded handle\nLatches 2 \"Trigger Release\" latches\nWheels No\nColor Black\nWater Resistance Watertight, crushproof, and dust proof (MIL-C-4150J)\nEmpty Weight 16 lbs.\n\n\nModel 200M: Mobile Card Vault\n\n[IMG]http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m493/70ToppsFanatic/CaseHandleUp_zps2f2c64b0.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPrice: $275/case + economy shipping\n\nHolds approximately 250-300* standard-sized PSA cards in 4 rows. Similar 4-row configuration to model 200, but comes with a pull-up handle and wheels to minimize heavy lifting. Meets all airline requirements for carry-on usage. Designed for the needs of card-show \u201croad warriors\u201d looking for a durable, ergonomic, ease for transporting graded cards on a regular basis. \n\nL x W x H (ID) 20.5\" x 11.5\" x 7.5\"\nLid / Base 2 + 5.5\"\nMaterial Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)\nATA Rated Yes\nPadlockable Yes\nHandles 2 Snap-down rubber over-molded handle\nLatches \"Trigger Release\" latch system\nWheels Yes\nColor Black\nWater Resistance Watertight, crushproof, and dust proof (MIL-C-4150J)\nEmpty Weight 10.5 lbs.\n\n\nModel 305: Graded Pack Card Vault\n\n[IMG]http://i1128.photobucket.com/albums/m493/70ToppsFanatic/Open_Graded_Pack_zpsfa583526.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nPrice: $325/case + economy shipping\n\nHolds approximately 90-100** PSA graded cello packs in 4 rows.  In response to the inquiries that have been made for a graded pack storage\nmodel we are pleased to introduce an additional model to satisfy this need.\n\nL x W x H (ID) 22\" x 17\" x 8\"\nLid / Base (ID) 2 + 6\"\nMaterial Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)\nATA Rated Yes\nPadlockable Yes\nHandles Snap-down rubber over-molded handle\nLatches 2 \"Trigger Release\" latches\nWheels No\nColor Black\nWater Resistance Watertight, crushproof, and dust proof (MIL-C-4150J)\nEmpty Weight 16 lbs.\n\n\n* NOTE: The thickness of graded cards varies by grading company.  Accordingly, the capacity of each Card Vault case is approximate, and will vary somewhat depending on which cards are being stored/transported.  The Model 300 pictured above has been loaded to a full capacity of 410 PSA cards against the quoted approximate capacity of 375-400 cards.\n\n** NOTE: Capacity estimates for the graded pack storage Card Vault was done using 1970 and 1975 Topps BB cello packs.  If storing graded wax packs,\nwhich are slightly thinner, or a combination of wax and cello packs we would anticipate a slightly higher capacity than what is shown here.",
