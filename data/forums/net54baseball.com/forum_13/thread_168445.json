      "post_content": "I am looking to trade in order to complete my T206 NY Highlanders subset.\n\nThe following are my needs:\n\n  Cree, Birdie  Follow Thru\n  Elberfeld, Kid  Portrait\n  Engle, Clyde  Batting\n  Frill, John  Follow Thru\n  Hemphill, Charlie  Fielding\n  Keeler, Willie  Batting\n  Kleinow, Red  Catching\n  Knight, Jack  Batting\n  Manning, Rube  Pitching\n  Quinn, Jack  Follow Thru\n  Warhop, Jack  Batting\n\nMy first priority on the list would be Keeler Batting.  My requirements are that the cards be SGC or raw.  I also want them to be presentable with no paper loss or holes.  Grades are what they are (no authentics).\n\nFor trade, I have the following link:\n\n[url]http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/Cooper1927/for-saletrade[/url]\n\nI would also be interested in other NY Highlander type cards (E103-Chase, E93, E98, T215, M116, etc.)\n\nYou may email me at [url]cooper1927@yahoo.com[/url], or PM me.\n\nThank you.",
