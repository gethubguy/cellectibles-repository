      "post_content": "I could be off about this, but I've noted not just the usual blips--and obvious big sales on very rare backs and cards--but general trend in recent weeks toward higher prices for more scarce t206s.  I think the surge in prices for EPDGs, Tolstoi and Cycle has been discussed, but I see it for many types of t206s where scarcity counts (and seemingly much wider reliance on pop reports).  Last night, for example, a dozen PSA 5 SLers sold on eBay at perhaps record or near-record prices for many of them.   Not a huge increase but, to me, fits the  trend. Your thoughts?",
