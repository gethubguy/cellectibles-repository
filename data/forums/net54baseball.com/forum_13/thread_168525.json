If you're willing to pay with Payment Owed, I won't fight you! \n\nIf you want to make an offer for multiple cards, please do not refrain from doing so - no matter what the offer is. The worst I'll say is \"Thanks for the interest, but I won't be able to do that.\" No offense will be taken.\n\nE-mail better than pm if you want a fast response: [url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\n\nI don't see a zoom option on photobucket, but if you download the scans, you'll get a view of the card that presents every flaw. If you aren't able to do that, and want larger scans - e-mail me and I'll send them over. If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nScans/Prices of T205s:\n\n[url]http://s1307.photobucket.com/user/the_coop/library/T205%20For%20sale?sort=4&page=1[/url]\n\nScans/Prices of T206s:\n\n[url]http://s1307.photobucket.com/user/the_coop/library/T206%20T207?sort=4&page=1[/url]\n\n.",
