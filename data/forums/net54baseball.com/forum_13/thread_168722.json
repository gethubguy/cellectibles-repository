Prices are continuing to climb.\n\nAnd an SGC 30 WITH paper loss on the back just went for $114....\n\nA PSA 1.5 sold for $124 a little over a month ago...\n\nLooks like an SGC 40 Titus just went for $161 last night in Sterling....\n\nI feel like I'm giving this away.  If it doesn't sell by the weekend, it's getting pulled.",
