      "post_content": "Hi.\n\nI would like to buy or possibly trade for a T206 American Beauty 460 of Hughie Jennings (Two Hands/ Dancing shot).\n\nI do not necessarily care about the grade, but I prefer one that is pleasant on the eyes and does not have any major flaws (massive crease, heavy staining, destructive paper loss etc. etc. etc.).\n\nIf you have one of these and would consider parting with it, please feel free to shoot me a PM and I would love to discuss a potential deal.\n\nThank You Very Much.\n\nDerek",
