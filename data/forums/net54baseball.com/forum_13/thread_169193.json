      "post_content": "Hi,\nI bought this on ebay and then realized I didn't need this card.  I paid $34.85 plus $2.50 shipping so I would like to get that out of it.  Will also trade for a beater Type 2 Coupon or Weil Baking.  The back is a Piedmont 350 factory 25 in typical PSA2 condition with no writing or paper loss.\n\nAny type of payment is fine.  Please email [url]rickmcquillan@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks! Rick",
