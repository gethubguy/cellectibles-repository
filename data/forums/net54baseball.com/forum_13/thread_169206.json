Have 10 of the 12 C46 catchers now!\n\nNeed just 2 more C46 catchers: Mitchell (Buffalo) and Hardy (Montreal).\n\nI know there is a nice Hardy on eBay but the seller only does PayPal, which I no longer use. Looking for creaseless examples with minimal chipping. I also have a Graham duplicate available as well.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nPatrick",
