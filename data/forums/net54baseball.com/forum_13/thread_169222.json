      "post_content": "Hello all,\n\nFor sale is a hard to find HOFer T206 Joe Tinker \"bat on shoulder\" with the tough Cycle 460 back.  Graded 2.5 by GAI.  Has a couple tiny spots of paper loss on the front, but doesn't take away from the overall eye appeal.  An SGC 4 grade example just sold a little over a year ago for $4,300.  SGC has only graded two examples of this front/back combo, PSA has only graded one and GAI has only graded this one.  Definitely one of the scarcer combos in Tinker's T206 lineup.\n\nPrice for this beautiful example is $575 OBO shipped and fully insured via PayPal gift.  PM if interested.  Thanks\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-57.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-58.jpg[/IMG]",
