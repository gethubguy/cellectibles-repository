      "post_content": "Hello all,\n\nFor sale is an unbelievablely beautiful SGC 40 T206 Ty Cobb with the tough Green Apple Sovereign 350 back.  This card speaks for itself.  Absolutely stunning condition with sharp corners, near perfect centering and crease free with a sharp bold image.  Undergraded IMO, should easily be at least a 4, possibly 4.5.  Price is $2350 shipped and fully insured.  First to say \"I'll take it\" gets it.  PM if interested. Thanks\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-59.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-60.jpg[/IMG]",

I haven't been able to locate one, and it seems others haven't either.  I will agree if this was an even tougher back, we would be in the $5-10K range.  A member has a Cycle 460 Cobb BO in a 1 condition with a slight tear and won't even part with it for $7500......An SGC 40 EPDG (which is pretty close to the same scarcity level) just went for over $3200 a couple months ago. I'd say the premiums are already there for these tougher backs, lol.  Not to mention, the SGC 40 EPDG was pretty worn around for a 40....IMO mine looks like a 5 compared to this card. \n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-63.jpg[/IMG]",

I haven't been able to locate one, and it seems others haven't either.  I will agree if this was an even tougher back, we would be in the $5-10K range.  A member has a Cycle 460 Cobb BO in a 1 condition with a slight tear and won't even part with it for $7500......An SGC 40 EPDG (which is pretty close to the same scarcity level) just went for over $3200 a couple months ago. I'd say the premiums are already there for these tougher backs, lol.  Not to mention, the SGC 40 EPDG was pretty worn around for a 40....IMO mine looks like a 5 compared to this card. \n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-63.jpg[/IMG][/QUOTE]\n\nYes, I've seen several, Levi has one on ebay that's been there for quite a while. PSA has graded 15 at 3 or better with Sovereign designated, so I'm sure they have graded quite a few more than that.
