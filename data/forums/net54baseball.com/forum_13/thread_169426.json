      "post_content": "For sale is a beautiful SGC 40 T206 Ty Cobb with the tough Green Apple Sovereign 350 back. This card speaks for itself. Absolutely stunning condition with sharp corners, near perfect centering and crease free with a sharp bold image. There does seem to be a small area of slight paper undulation \"surface wrinkle\" on the reverse, however this DOES NOT go through to the front of the card.  Undergraded IMO, could easily be a 4, as we've all seen 3s in much worse condition.  Price is SOLD OBO shipped and fully insured overnight.  PM if interested.  Thanks.\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-59.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-60.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-61.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c182/grw1911/image-62.jpg[/IMG]",
