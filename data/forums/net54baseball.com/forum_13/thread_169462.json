Please delete the other thread if you want to...\nAnyways.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello everyone,\n\nFinally getting back into buying after a month of being out of town. I'd like to purchase a Matty T206 \"Dark Cap\", preferably a grade of 2,3, or 4. I am not a fan of eBay mostly because I'm impatient and I rather give money to the fellow members. This being said, I do reference their past sold auctions for pricing. \n\nIf anyone is willing to part with their Matty then let me know and I will humor you with a decent offer.\n\nLastly, if anyone else has any interesting Matty memorabilia/cards I will also be interested. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nColby Tan",
