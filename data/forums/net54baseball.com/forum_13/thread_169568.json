I wanted to give the community here an opportunity at some nice items that don't come around all that often but It appears these are better suited for an auction site.\n\nHopefully they find a nice home soon.",

I figure it doesn't hurt at all to post it high there for free to see if anyone buys it. Because of all the fees I have to price it higher.\n\nI'm willing to sell these at a respectable price but I'm not exactly sure what that is, but I surely know its not the prices one member quoted from canfield's site.  I'm not going to give these away.",
