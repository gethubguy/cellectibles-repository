Should I only collect SGC or PSA - which is better for the 206's? \n\nI am looking for anything grade 4 or higher - PSA grade or the equivalent SGC. \n\nThanks..... Ray",

      "post_content": "If you are simply collecting for the joy of collecting them SGC holders are much better looking for asthetics. If you are buying and expect to resell then a great amount of the time PSA commands more money. \n\nIn 4's or better I think SGC begins to close the gap a little. I am sure you will find many opinions on this.\n\nAND\n\nyou will be told that this post was put in the wrong forum. I am sure Leon will help move this over to the more general discussion forum.",
