Brashear and Castleton, are 150 Subjects backs, plus three different 1911.\n\nI conservatively grade the 1910s as 15 Poor, 23 Fair, 11 Good and 10 Very Good.\n\nThey are grouped by condition in the scans.\n\nThe whole lot is available for $250, delivered.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101185&d=1370029061[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101186&d=1370029074[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101187&d=1370029086[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101188&d=1370029097[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101189&d=1370029109[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=101190&d=1370029124[/IMG]",
