I am attaching the images of all 13 and the prices of the 6 that are left. I am always surprised that the lower grade ones sell easier for similar prices.........HMM. Please feel free to ask any questions. I will consider lowering the prices some for a group deal or the remaining 6\n\nPeckinpaugh Green sold\nFoster Green Near Mint $ 30.00\nMcBride Green $sold\nDemmit Green sold\nSnodgrass Brown sold\nMorgan Brown EXMT $35.00\nTesreau Green EXMT/NMT$40.00\nTesreau Brown EXMT/NMT$50.00\nHamilton Purple sold\nWilson Purple sold\nShotton Purple sold\nMowrey Red tough blanket EXMT $75.00\nOtolle Purple EXMT $50.00",
