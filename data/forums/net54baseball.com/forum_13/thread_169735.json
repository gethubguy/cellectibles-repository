      "post_content": "I just picked this card up yesterday and didn't realize that it had a partial name at top. Jimmy Jackson, Baltimore PSA 6 (OC) with the partial name of Danny Hoffman, St. Louis, Amer. at top. I believe that this is the first identified variation with this name combo. I don't collect double name T206's, but I know that there are some board members who do. I am hoping to trade for a lesser graded HOFer or rare back. I'm interested in the following, but feel free to PM or email (woelfmansteve@aol.com) me with any interesting trade proposals.\n\nBacks: Carolina Brights, Piedmont 350-460 Factory 42, Red Hindu, Black Lenox\nHOF'ers: Cobb red portrait, Young portrait, Matty Portrait, Lajoie portrait, Keeler portrait\n\nThanks for looking,\n\nSteve",
