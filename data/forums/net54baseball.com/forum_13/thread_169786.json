      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\n\nLooking to trade this card. Most of my cards are poor to good, so this one sticks out like a sore thumb. :p\n\nFWIW, it's  the highest graded by SGC, and the only one graded higher is a PSA 6. \n\nIn return I'd be looking for Highlanders (NY AL) T206's in poor to vg condition\nwith Cycle 460 and above reverses.\n\nA couple exceptions would be Keeler, or Chesbro in EPDG, or Sovereign 150/350 backs\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to a trade/cash situation if the right card was involved, but I'm not looking to sell it outright at this time.\n\nPM me if you think you have something that's a match. Thanks!\n\n[URL=http://s1049.photobucket.com/user/TheBabe1918/media/IMG_0001_NEW_zps08bf7077.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/IMG_0001_NEW_zps08bf7077.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=http://s1049.photobucket.com/user/TheBabe1918/media/IMG_0004_NEW_zps9a019380.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/IMG_0004_NEW_zps9a019380.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
