      "post_content": "Offering up a very tough-to-complete 1909 Obak complete set!  Condition is pretty varied in this group.  There are a number of cards in the GD to VG range with a few even higher.  There are also quite a few cards in \"AUT\" holders.  Many of the cards in AUT holders were not trimmed, yet that's simply where they put the handcut examples, of which there are many in the 09 set.\n\nI went through the lot this afternoon and there really weren't any true dogs in the lot.  There were a couple I graded as \"PR\" due to creasing, but nothing that was truly beat up or very rough.  So I'd say it's an attractive set on the whole but you would have at least a little room for upgrading.\n\nThis group also has a few cards in it for those that like collecting \"oddities\" or printing goofs.  The Baum is a rich, dark orange colored variation; it is normally seen in yellow.  The Hitt has a \"double printed\" back and the Carson is handcut with oversized borders and a blank back.\n\nAsking $9000 delivered on the group, which is in line or maybe a bit lower than what complete Obak sets are going for nowadays.  For the time being, I'm selling the group intact, although if enough people need individual cards, I might also consider breaking them up as well.\n\nPlayers and card conditions are listed below.  Scans available upon request.
