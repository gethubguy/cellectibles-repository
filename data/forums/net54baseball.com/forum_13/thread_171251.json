      "post_content": "Hi, I have 4 T213-2's that I would like to trade.  These are low grade cards and I am looking for low grade cards in return.  All 4 cards are available for trade, but if you only need one that is fine.  I have 36 Type 2's so the chances are good that I will need anything that you have to trade.  I am only looking to trade for Louisiana issues - Coupons, Weil Baking, etc.\n\nWould also consider giving cash plus a card (or cards) for one of your cards.\n\nPlease send me an email at [url]rickmcquillan@gmail.com[/url] if you are interested. \n\nThanks,\nRick",
