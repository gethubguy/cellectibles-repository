      "post_content": "Hi guys. Looking to make a wedding gift for my friend whos last name is butler. He loves the game and played a lot during his life. My plan is to buy some pre 1920s cards that show his last name like the T206 John Butler card. I plan to get them framed for him.  I see he has a t201, t206 and an e90-1 with butler, Not sure if any others are out there but Id like to know.\nIf yall have any low condition butlers please pm me.\nThanks guys.",
