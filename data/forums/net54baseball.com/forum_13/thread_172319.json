      "post_content": "T205 Tommy Leach with a Cycle back. Super nice appearing card. I bought this from a recent auction hoping it was just tilt cut and SGC didn't like it. Upon receiving it, I am still 50/50 on being trimmed, the top and bottom are similarly angle cut and the right side has the correct rolled over look and while the card is not huge, it's by no means small in size either. I will just have to call it a card with great eye appeal that is \"probably\" trimmed. And yes it's got nice green print transfer on the back from the underlying sheet.\n\n$50 delivered to anyone that wants it, paypay \"money owed\"",
