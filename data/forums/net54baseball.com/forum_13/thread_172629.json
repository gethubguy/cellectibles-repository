      "post_content": "I have a T205 Matty that I would like to trade for E94s that I don't have. If I can't trade it, I'll put a price on it. The card has been trimmed on the bottom border but has great eye appeal. Matty also has two sets of eyes. Price is SOLD.\n                                          Thanks,\n                                            Steve",
