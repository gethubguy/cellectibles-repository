      "post_content": "Graded T207 partial set for sale - 111 different graded cards (90 SGC, 21 PSA) - asking $8000.\n\nThe group consists of 11 Broadleaf-class cards and 100 Recruits, including many tough cards such as Donnelly, Sweeney, Miller (Otto & Roy), Moore, Block, Carrigan, Higgins, etc... and some tough for the grade cards (Barry SGC 60, Fromme SGC 50, Kutina SGC 50).  The average grade is just over PSA 3/SGC 40.  \n\nSee the [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/gspinf/forsaletrade/t207partialset?z=3&l=0&c=3&n=1&m=-1&w=4&x=0&p=60\"]scans[/URL] if you're interested.  there's a [URL=\"http://imageevent.com/gspinf/forsaletrade/t207partialset?p=0&n=1&m=-1&c=3&l=0&w=4&s=0&z=3\"]spreadsheet[/URL] with player, variation, back, grade available with the scans.\n\nI think the asking price is pretty fair - it'd take time to assemble the grouping for that if you're looking to start the set.  Let me know by PM or [URL=\"mailto:mikefrohme@yahoo.com\"]email[/URL] if you're interested and we can talk turkey.\n\nThis group is going for consignment if there's no interest or offers by 7/31.\n\nFor full disclosure, this group was offered in slightly different composition in a [URL=\"http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=167203&highlight=starter\"]previous thread[/URL] - this offer has ~ 30 new cards with some cards removed - the price has been adjusted appropriately.\n\nThanks in advance for your interest.\n--\nMike",
