      "post_content": "This handcut variation was found with a large group of Kotton and Mino-backed t216s and is likely a unique card that was hand cut from a printer's scrap sheet. Blank-backed t216s were not known to exist prior to this find.\n\nAltogether, the card is in GD/VG shape with mild wrinkling and corner wear.  I'm of course, overlooking the irregular hand cut borders however :)\n\n---card is now sold...thanks everyone....\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=108068&d=1374982000[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=108069&d=1374982023[/IMG]",
