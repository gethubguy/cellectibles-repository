      "post_content": "Hi, been looking awhile for a low-grade (PSA/SGC 1-3) or raw gradable T210-3 (with clean back) San Antonio card for my tobacco type card set. I have been waiting specifically for a San Antonio player as I currently live in SA. As I would love an orange border card, but this would likely have to be a PSA/SGC 1 due to cost . Please send PM or email me with any cards available.\nThanks\nDave",
