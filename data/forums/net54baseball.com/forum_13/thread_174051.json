I won't bump the threads relentlessly.\n\nHere is what is left from Lot 190 in the recent SCP auction.  Smallish scans can be found here:\n\n[url]https://catalog.scpauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=25208[/url]\n\nThese prices are based on recent sales from VCP and Card Target.  Whatever doesn't sell here will go on ebay with BIN-prices a little higher than these.
