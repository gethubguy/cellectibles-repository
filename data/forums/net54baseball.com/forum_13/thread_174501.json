      "post_content": "THIS CARD HAS BEEN TRADED  :)\n\n\nHi,\nI have a decent looking Huggins Type 2 Coupon that I would like to trade.\n\nI am looking to trade for another Type 2.  Maybe a couple of beater commons?  Graded or ungraded.  Or a beater Holsum plus some cash from me, or Weil Baking.  Pretty much anything made in Louisiana and condition is not an issue unless it is really nasty.\n\nI love to trade so feel free to see if we can work something out.\n\nThanks, Rick",
