      "post_content": "Just back from SGC, two more cards that have been tucked away for three-plus decades in a collection of a longtime hobbyist.\n\nT205 Speaker, Piedmont, SGC 50/4 (look at cards on VCP with the same grade from SGC, and you'll find this one compares very well. My guess is it didn't receive a higher grade because of a light stain in the upper-left corner. I'll take a stain on the back of a T205 rather than excessive chipping on the borders every time. Then again, I'm not a T205 \"expert.\") SOLD\n\nT205 Lord, Hassan, SGC 60/5 SOLD\n\nPrices are delivered within the United States.\n\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.\n\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com [/URL]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/orange/t205s.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/orange/t205rev.jpg[/IMG]",
