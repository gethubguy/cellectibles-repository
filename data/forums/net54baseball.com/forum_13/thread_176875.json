T205 prices are following their t206 counter parts on the increase, but they are still trailing by a HUGE distance.  \n\nMy wife keeps looking at t206 prices for freaks then looking at some of my non t206 freaks and asking when I am going to retire.  I have to keep explaining that it doesn't equate on the market, though they do equate in eye appeal.",
