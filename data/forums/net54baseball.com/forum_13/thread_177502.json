      "post_content": "Terrific start to a t207 set or even a Cycle/Broadleaf t207 subset project. These are some of the absolute toughest t207s in the set and an assortment of tough players/backs that you're not likely to come across again for a very long time. \n\nThree Cycle backs and several Broadleafs are included in the group below. Several incredibly tough players such as Donnelly, Downey, Mogridge, Rath and others are also included.\n\nConditionwise, the cards are all over the place. The average condition seems to be about FR...or SGC 20 range with several in GD and several others in SGC 10 condition\n\nAsking $4500 for the group altogether, which is actually a bit below my cost to assemble all of these. Scans available upon request. I would certainly consider trade offers or split payments, delayed payments or partial trade to give any potential buyer more flexibility. I would prefer to keep the group together but can also consider offers for specific cards.\n\nBenz (Anon - Factory #25) SGC 20\nBlackburne (Anon - Factory #3) SGC 10 - corner wrinkles/wear\nDonnelly (Anon - Factory #25) GD - wrinkling\nDonnelly (Anon - Factory #3) SGC Aut - writing on back\nDowney (Anon - Factory #25) FR/GD - wrinkling\nGregg (Broadleaf - Factory #25) SGC 30\nHerzog (Broadleaf- Factory #25) VG - sharp corners, single small wrinkle, card measures short\nKelly (Anon - Factory #3) PSA 1 - pinhole\nKirke (Cycle - Factory #25) SGC 35\nKutina (Anon - Factory #3) PSA 1\nMiller, Roy (Anon - Factory #3) PSA 1.5 - no wrinkling on front, very nice looking\nMiller, Otto (Broadleaf - Factory #25) SGC Aut\nMogridge (Anon - Factory #3) SGC 20\nMoriarty (Cycle - Factory #25) SGC 30 \nPelty (Anon - Factory #25) FR/GD - wrinkling\nPhelan (Anon - Factory #3) PSA 1 - pinhole\nRath (Broadleaf - Factory #25) TRM - measures short but EX on front\nRyan (Broadleaf - Factory #25) SGC 10\nSweeney (Broadleaf - Factory #25) SGC 30\nWallace (Recruit - Factory #606) PR/FR - creasing\nWilson, Owen (Broadleaf - Factory #25) PSA 3 (mk)\nWoodburn (Cycle - Factory #25) SGC 10",
