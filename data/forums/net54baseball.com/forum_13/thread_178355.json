      "post_content": "Fresh batch of 'T206' Tobacco card wooden boxes are back!  Currently, 6 are in stock and ready to ship.  My father-in-law has sold over 2 dozen of these in the past couple years (mostly to Net54 members).  I PM'd just about everyone that has been requesting one for months.  A few have been sold already.\nNet54 discount is set at $150 + $25 S/H = $175 via PayPal, MO, check.  International will be more.\nPM me to place an order.\nThese are beautiful, cigar style boxes.  Please visit [url]http://www.dakotawoodcrafts.com[/url] for more pictures and information.  \nThese hold about 525 'Ultra-Pro' tobacco top loaders.  Dividers can be removed to hold about 40 graded cards - see pictures.  Available with or without top logo.\n\nA couple 'Graded' card boxes remain as well.\n\nIf the pictures don't load - please see the website.\n\n[IMG]http://www.dakotawoodcrafts.com/uploads/6/1/2/8/6128218/6175214.jpg[/IMG]",
