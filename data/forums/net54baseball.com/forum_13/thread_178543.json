I have 42 of the Brownies and 27 of the Obaks so there is a good chance that I need what you might have to offer. I am looking for a handful of commons from each set to make me feel like I am getting someplace :D. I am looking for either Raw or Slabbed, SGC30/40  or the PSA equivalent. Shoot me a PM and let me know what you have. Hopefully we can work something.:D Thanks in advance to all who may reply....Mike",
