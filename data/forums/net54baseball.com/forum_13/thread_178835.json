      "post_content": "Nice group of t207s here that would make a great starter group or help fill a lot of holes in a Cycle/BL/Anon set run.  Some of the toughest cards in the entire set are in this group.  I'm hoping to trade as many as possible for t204s as it seems that a lot of these tougher t207s match up pretty well with t204 commons.  I put prices including shipping on the cards as well in case anyone wanted to buy any straight up.\n\nScans available upon request.
