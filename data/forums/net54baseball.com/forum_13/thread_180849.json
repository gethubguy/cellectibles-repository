Very little wear and the back is clean and damage free.  Great pose too!  Asking $85 delivered....\n\nAlso, Would love to trade the Saier straight up for a t204 if anyone had one available....\n\n\n*** card is now sold ***\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=126934&d=1388349395[/IMG]",
