      "post_content": "T200 Premium for sale.  $1400\n\nSize is about 21\" x 13\"\n\nI don't know the full history behind this piece, but it looks like it was prepared for some kind of publication.  It's been altered from it's original form in the following ways that I can tell:\n\nHas silver pen writing numbering on each player.\nHas notes to an engraver on the right side.\nHas a staple in the top.\n\nTwo players were cut from their original spot in the photo and moved (adhered) to a different position in the photo so they would fit in the photo. \n\nMore scans here:  [url]http://imageevent.com/caramelcard/e902;jsessionid=0kkxa2dyv3.camel_s[/url]\n\nStill, the piece is in pretty nice shape and presents well.  And, kind of tough to find.  ;)\n\nEmail or PM if you're interested.  (Would consider trades as well)\n\nThanks.  \n\nRob\n\n\n[URL=\"http://imageevent.com/caramelcard/e902\"][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/caramelcard/e902/websize/IMG_3549.JPG[/IMG][/URL]",
