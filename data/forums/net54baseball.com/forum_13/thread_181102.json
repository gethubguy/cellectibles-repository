I can't afford more than a VG of any of these, and while I dont want any disastrous beaters, I do prioritize registration, then creasing, and then centering.

Has a few condition isuues such as being trimmed at the top, glue residue on back, #16 printed on the back, short line of ink a third of the way up on the front right side, and small edge rips, etc. \n\nScans will show all.\n\nDespite the noted flaws, the card still presents pretty well. If interested let me know.\n\nI'm looking for $80.00 delivered. \n\nCheck or United States Postal Money are O.K. I do not use PayPal.\n\nPatrick",

They can have problems, but they need to have clear registration, good contrast, and generally good eye appeal.  Back damage, writing on the back, some creasing, and off-centering don't bother me too much.\nPlease let me know if you have one of these that might fit the bill!\nI hope to complete this team set this year, because I need to move on to the T204 and T3 Cubs...ugh.\n\nThomas Leach\nArthur Phelan\nFrank Schulte\nVic Saier\n\nThanks,\nJason",
