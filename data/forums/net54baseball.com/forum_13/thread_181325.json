      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI'm selling the pictured 23 card lot of T218 athletes - all Hassan and Mecca backs.  It's a nice lot of mid-grade-ish cards - no beauties but no beaters either.\n\n$50 delivered - about $2 per card - how can you go wrong for that price for 100+ year old cards??\n\nPM me if you want them - PayPal, check, any other payment forms you have likely will be accepted as well.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott\n\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f81/scooter0729/scan050_zpsf8bbcc3c.jpg[/IMG]",
