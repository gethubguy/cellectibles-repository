No idea if somebody's trimmed it or if it's factory cut (or if there's even a way to tell!), but the card still presents very well.\n\nGONE\n\nAll prices include shipping.  PayPal preferred.\n\n\nYou can post to this thread or email me at [url]richard@richardarmstrong.ca[/url].\n\nThanks!\n\nRichard.",
