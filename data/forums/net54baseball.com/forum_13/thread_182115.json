      "post_content": "hey guys - Hope this one finds a good home.  According to the SGC this is their highest graded Tyler.  And according to today's SGC pop report there are only 27 other Cycle backs at this grade or higher.    PSA doesn't breakdown their backs so I can't give accurate info on their graded Tylers.\n\nAsking SOLD.  Thanks for looking.   Please PM if interested.\n\npeter",
