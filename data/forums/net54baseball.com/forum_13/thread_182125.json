Not sure if this includes BP or not.\n\nIf you're wondering, the smudge near Anderson's ear is some kind of surface debris. It might or might not be removable, though I'm not sure I'd mess with it. \n\nPaypal OK. Sale price will include shipping with insurance in the U.S.\n\nThanks, Ray\n\nEmail: semloh00 (at) yahoo.com\n\n[IMG][URL=https://imageshack.com/i/g13rytj][IMG]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/xq90/577/3ryt.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][URL=https://imageshack.com/i/0f2td1j][IMG]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/xq90/15/2td1.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]",
