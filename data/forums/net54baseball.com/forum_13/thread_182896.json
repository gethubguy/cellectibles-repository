So I figured that I would give this a shot...\n\nI will leave this posting up for the next few days and trade my $200.00 to the seller with the best graded card being offered.\n\nPost pics .. or pm me ... whatever you think will seal the deal!\n\nWould love a graded 1 2 or Authentic : Ruth, Dimaggio, Gehrig, Walter Johnson, Christie Mathewson, Cy young, Ty Cobb .. Realize its a long shot... but there may be someone motivated to help a new vintage collector out.\n\n\nCheers!\n\nPs. I live in Toronto Canada. Shouldn't be an issue, but to be fair I wanted to make it well known that I live outside of the USA. I have over 1000 purchases with 100% feedback combined between here / ebay / blowoutcards.ca",
