It comes in a four-screw Lucite holder (purchased this way and never removed).  There is no paper loss (bits of residue on back is on Lucite holder, not card).  Good color and registry.  If you have any questions please PM or email me at acowan19(at)gmail(dot)com.\n\nFront: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-k56w3hx[/url]\n\nBack: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-sbtdG4B[/url]",
