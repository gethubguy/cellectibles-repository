      "post_content": "For sale are two Slim Sallee cards.  I find it interesting that both cards show the same pose.  I am only looking to sell these cards, not trade.  I am flexible on pricing so don't shy away from a counter-offer.  If you have any questions send a PM or email to acowan19(at)gmail(dot)com.\n\n1914 T222 Fatima, Slim Sallee - $150/OBO\nCard is graded SGC 20 (1.5) Fair.  No paper loss or writing.  Primary flaw is upper left corner being clipped off.  O/C about 20/80.  There are two wrinkles: one from left edge moving horizontal toward the armpit, another from the right edge moving horizontal toward the waist.  Neither crease goes across the player or entire card.  The reverse is clean.  Good registry overall.\n\nFront: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-kbzp47m[/url]\nBack: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-RSsQcbX[/url]\n\n1911 T3 Turkey Red, Slim Sallee - $250/OBO\nCard is in good condition.  No paper loss or writing.  Corners are slightly rounded.  Some staining and chipping along the edges.  There are three surface wrinkles on the front:  one along the left edge running the length of the card, another on each of the lower corners.  Reverse is clean, and shows the 1-76 Ad Back.\n\nFront: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-gCW85Lq[/url]\nBack: [url]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/Baseball-Cards/n-rxmvS/i-Pq6sd9n[/url]",
