      "post_content": "Just got around to making a trade list for some other trades going on, and decided I really like trading, so why not put the list out here on the board?\n\nI primarily am looking for:\n\n* Any complete sets, any grade (pre-1973)\n* Partial sets (with stars and RCs, not just commons), any grade\n* ANY HOFers in pre-war - usually collect low grade due to affordability\n* Will also consider 1948-68 key RCs or stars like Mantle/Williams/Robinson\n* T206 Ty Cobb (any), low grade or Authentic Only\n* Unusual pre-1940 Lou Gehrig items\n\n\nHere is what I have. If the list comes out all scrambled from Excel, please PM me with your email address and I can send the excel file as an attachment. Please ask for grades or pictures of anything ungraded on my list.\n\nThanks - now let's have some fun!\nMark\n\n\nSet Name Card Graded\n1906 Russell's Rustlers Playing Cards Unknown Player (Type Card From Leon Luckey) \n1908-10 American Caramel E91 Mike Donlin \n1909-11 T206 Piedmont 350 Factory 25 Eddie Collins/Philadelphia BVG 2\n1909-11 T206 Sweet Caporal 350 Factory 30 Addie Joss/Pitching BVG 1\n1909-11 T206 Sweet Caporal 150 Factory 30 Art Devlin \n1909-11 T206 Piedmont 350 Factory 25 Harry Hinchman/Portrait \n1909-11 T206 Piedmont 150 Factory 25 Hal Chase/Throwing White Cap \n1909-11 T206 Piedmont 350 Factory 25 Chief Myers/Fielding (Meyers) PSA 1\n1909-11 T206 Sweet Caporal 150 Factory 30 Jake Stahl/No Glove Shows PSA 1\n1909-11 T206 Tolstoi Hal Chase/Throwing Dark Cap \n1910-19 Coupon T213 Sherry Magee Philadelphia Nat 2 Variation BVG 1\n1911 T205 Gold Border Sweet Caporal Walter Johnson BVG 1.5\n1911 T205 Gold Border Sweet Caporal Topps 206 Encased William Bailey \n1912 T207 Recruit Little Cigars R.E. \"Tex\" Erwin \n1913 Fatima Teams T200 Cleveland Americans (Shoeless Joe Jackson, etc.) BVG 1\n1918 B18 Blankets Zach Wheat \n1918 B18 Blankets Walter Johnson \n1921-23 National Caramel E220 Sam \"Bucky\" Harris Hand-cut\n1920s Unknown Exhibit Al Simmons \n1925-27 W512 Dave Bancroft \n1925-27 W512 Dazzy Vance BVG 5\n1930 Ray-O-Print Lou Gehrig BVG 7.5\n1930 W554 Hack Wilson \n1930 W554 Mickey Cochrane \n1931 W517 Bill Terry \n1933 Goudey Rabbit Maranville \n1933 Goudey Bill Terry THROW \n1933 Goudey Al Simmons \n1933 Tattoo Orbit R308 Ted Lyons SGC A\n1933 Worch Cigar Minors Buzz Arlett (Babe Ruth of the Minors - very rare card) \n1934 Goudey Knot Hole League Membership Card Lou Gehrig BVG 2\n1936 Diamond Match Co.
