      "post_content": "Ok I lied, 99% PSa graded and the Cobb is at PSA and was an SGC 2.  GPA will sit just about 1.5 with great eye appeal on 99% of the cards. Just THREE commons with mk designations, and only TWO labeled as authentic. These are $75 a piece just to have graded as PSA and at 100 cards a collector would be looking at 7500 in grading fees\n\nWaiting on the last handful of cards to be graded, then they will added to the set.\n\nLooking sell or trade thinking right around 25k\n\nLink can be found below with all cards scanned\n\n[url]http://www.psacard.com/PSASetRegistry/publishedset.aspx?s=23250[/url]\n\nThanks! \n\n\n\n[IMG]http://caimages.collectors.com/psaimages/1114/21790941/acards038.jpg[/IMG]",
