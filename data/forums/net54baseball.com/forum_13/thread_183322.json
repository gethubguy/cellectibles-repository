      "post_content": "Guys.............Even though I only have about 10 so far, I'm looking to add to my collection of Fatima T222's. Although I'm not necessarily looking for technically high graded cards, I am looking for cards with good eye appeal and a dark image. Those are a must. Cards that would grade in the A-3 range are probably just fine. I don't care if a card is trimmed, off center, has a chipped corner, or a couple creases. Thanks and please PM me and I'll relay my email address for scans.\n\nMatt",

I want the dark areas 'black' and not 'grey'. When it comes to the contrast in the image, I'm a little anal about it. I'll post a few examples of mine later. Thanks for posting.............Matt",
