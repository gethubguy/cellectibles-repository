      "post_content": "First off, I hope its ok to post a large list like this...\n\nSecondly, I am looking to get a few more old HOF players.  Not interested in high dollar cards as these are for me and my boys to complete a collection of 1 of every HOF player from the time they where playing or managing.  In fact have had great success in getting some big names on \"panels\" that I guess have been cut from a full card.  So we are open to those to!  \n\nThanks for any help, let me know what you have and what you need for it!\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j118/drjdog5150/HOFpage1_zps56529b4e.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j118/drjdog5150/HOFpage2_zpsb17fa9f0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j118/drjdog5150/HOFpage3_zps486975b9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j118/drjdog5150/HOFpage4_zpsee9c075d.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThanks again!\nJason",
