I will consider other trades also for pre-war big name HOFers (Ruth, Gehrig, Cobb, Mathewson, Johnson, Young, etc.) from any set.\n\nThe Cobb presents well. The reason for the Auth-Altered grade is the back has a glue residue on it. I believe the glue was just used to affix it to a scrapbook at one time.",
