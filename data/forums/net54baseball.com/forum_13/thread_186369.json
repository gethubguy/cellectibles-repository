      "post_content": "Hi, I know the chances for a trade are slim, but I have a low grade T213-3 Myers that I would like to trade for 1 or more T213-2's.  I have been working on the Type 2 set and I currently have 63 cards from the Type 2 set and I am looking for more.\n\nI am looking for low grade cards, graded or ungraded, even real beaters, that I can add to my Type 2 set.  \n\nThanks, Rick",
