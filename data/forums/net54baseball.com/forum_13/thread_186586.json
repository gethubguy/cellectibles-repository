      "post_content": "This is an EXTREMELY rare red infield B18 Blanket.  The red is a printing error and only occurred with the Detroit Tigers and Boston Braves.  These were supposed to be brown infields, but there was an error with the ink.  This one is in flawless condition.  Very clean and vibrant.  There is also a slight remnants of the factory label on the back.  \n\nLew Lipset sold several a few years ago for over $3,000 each.  I am looking for $1,295 + shipping.\n\n[url]http://www.oldjudge.com/?showpage=/archive/20100401/b18-red-infield-blankets/&i=135[/url]\n\nThanks.\n\nChris\n[url]staindsox@hotmail.com[/url]",
