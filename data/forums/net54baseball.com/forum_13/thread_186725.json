I would like to try and finish this set off in 2014-15 but I need the following 8 cards:\n\nA Home Run\nA White Wash\nA Tie Game\nOut\nPut Out On 1st\nRight Over The Plate\nStrike One\nThe Red Sox\n\nI'm also looking to upgrade a couple of the other cards so if you have cards from this set that are not on the list I'd be interested in those as well.",
