      "post_content": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm looking to buy a large or semi-large collection of cards. A little over 5 years ago, I did the same thing, buying roughly 1 million cards from a collector on here with a lot of success (mostly modern cards though). It was a ton of fun to go through and make sets, keep stuff I needed, trade stuff to members of my online trading groups, let my daughters share in the rummaging and collecting, and sell some of it to regain some cash. Well, I only have about 30% of that collection left and most of it is dry bones now, so I'm looking to do something similar.\n\nA list of ideas of stuff I'd be looking for:\n- a dealer's collection of cards \n- complete sets or large starters (vintage)\n- large bulk lots\n- HOFers\n- graded and ungraded\n- prewar \n- looking to buy in bulk...not buying singles\n- Play Ball, Topps, Goudey, T-sets, E-sets, etc\n\nI'm really open to just about anything though. TRY ME!!! I just don't want to restock with stuff I already have and a lot of late '80s/early '90s stuff. \n\nPlease PM me with ideas. If I can't afford the lot, I've got a buddy who likely can. Thanks!\n\nJimi\n[url]jimivintage@yahoo.com[/url]",
