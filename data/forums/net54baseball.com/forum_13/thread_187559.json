I looked back and found an interesting thread about that (and incidentally another card you have for sale, and the only image I own from the set, also has the wrong image and that is Hartzell).\n\nI am sure you knew all of this, but I just thought I would give you a free bump while pointing out how my knowledge grew today because of your post.",
