      "post_content": "I have a large number of extra t204s from recent REA winnings that I thought I'd offer up to the board.  Some of these are available for sale or trade for other t204s.  Others I'll make available for downgrading purposes.  Meaning, if you would like to upgrade your lowergrade example with one of mine, I'm willing to work a cash/trade with you as long as I get your lowergrade example :)\n \nPrices below include shipping.  The two lots I won are #178 and #167 and can seen at the links below.  Scans of many of the cards are there although I can provide additional scans if requested.\n \n[url]http://bid.robertedwardauctions.com/bidplace.aspx?itemid=30322[/url]\n \n[url]http://bid.robertedwardauctions.com/bidplace.aspx?itemid=30311[/url]\n \nFor Sale and/or willing to \"downgrade\"\nStreet SGC 60 - $350\nBancroft SGC 55 - $275 [SOLD!!]\nBransfield SGC 55 - $325 [SOLD!!]\nMcAleer SGC 55 - $275\nSchulte SGC 55 - $275 [SOLD!!]\nMoran SGC 55 - $275 [SOLD!!]\nMurray SGC 55 - 325 [SOLD!!]\nRucker SGC 50 - $250\nLoebert SGC 40 - $165 [SOLD!!]\nUnclane (borders trimmed) - $25\n \nWilling to \"Downgrade\" only\nBates SGC 60 [TRADED!!]\nNiles PSA 5\nDavis SGC 50\nReulbach SGC 50\nHoward SGC 50 [TRADED!!]\nDorner SGC 55\nSpencer SGC 50 [TRADED!!]\nDonahue SGC 50 [TRADED!!]\nReilly SGC 50 \n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]",
