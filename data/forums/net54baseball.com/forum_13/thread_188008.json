Drum Corridon SGC 30, Broadleaf (Green back) Austin SGC A(SGC thought it was recolored, it is not, and will be reevaluated if not sold) and Hindu Pfeister PSA 3(wet sheet transfer on the front). A rare opportunity to acquire the very tough Hindu and Drum with a nice Broadleaf. \n\n$4,000 for the group, I will entertain individual offers as well.",
