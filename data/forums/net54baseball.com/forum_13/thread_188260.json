      "post_content": "Hey Fellas,\n\nHaving just completed grad school last week, I'm anxious to begin collecting again.  My previous focus had been '15 Cracker Jacks (for which I had spent five years collecting), but now it's time to change gears and begin amassing another favorite prewar set of mine: 1911 T205s.\n\nThat being said, I'm currently looking for commons (and perhaps a very minor star, or two) and I plan to build a uniform PSA 3 set - just like my CJs.  So, if you have anything on tap (again, I'm only interested in PSA 3 NQ), please send me a scan and a price and we can go from there.\n\n\nMany thanks!",
