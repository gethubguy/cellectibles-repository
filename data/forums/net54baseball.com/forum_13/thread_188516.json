      "post_content": "$125 shipped....#50 (Doescher), #78 (Hardy), and #89 (McCarty). Exish Condition, no creases or wrinkles that I can see (with one exception). McCarty is a little less nice than the other 2....maybe vg-ex on that one due to a very fine wrinkle that is small, does not break the paper, and does not show through to the other side of the card. Will sell individually, as well. Please inquire if interested.\n\nThanks,\nLee",
