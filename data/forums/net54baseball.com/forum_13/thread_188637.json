      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nThis is a vintage Turkey Red advertising poster, originally placed within an engraved Turkey Red frame.  I don't have the frame, but the poster has survived relatively well. \n\nI own several of these and this one is authentic and vintage (circa 1911), not a later reproduction.  It measures 13.5 X 17 including the white borders.  The borders are approximately 3/8 inch around.\n\nAs you can see it's a bit faded (it's actually a bit more \"red\" than it appears in the photo) and has some areas of damage around the border.  Also, please note that the area to the left of her face (just above the fez) is a rip.  All the paper is there and it lays down fine, but it is actually ripped there.  Even so, it's a very attractive piece with sharp graphics.\n\nThis is a very nice and very rare piece that should matte out quite well.  I've watched pricing on these quite closely for nearly 20 years and they usually sell for $500 - $1,000 even without the frame.  A nice one with a nice frame can be more.\n\nI'm asking SOLD for this one, shipped and insured.  Please feel free to ask any questions.  Thank you.\n\nBest,\nCraig",
