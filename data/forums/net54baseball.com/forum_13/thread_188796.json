      "post_content": "I've got a duplicate T201 of Hooks Wiltse and Fred Merkle that I would like to trade for another T201 I need for my set.  I've attached scans of the front and back for your review.  As you can see, it's not a mint card but it's far from ugly.\n\n[IMG]http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm231/otismattsey/wiltsemerkleback.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm231/otismattsey/287e8b1a-2a89-4ab2-803f-23fcf1f3c333.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHere are the cards I need for my set.  I'd prefer a lesser condition, but non-beater, examples such as I'm offering, but a beater of one of the few HOFers I still need would also work for me.\n\nAbstein/Butler\nBaker/Downie\nLapp/Barry\nBender/Oldring\nWheat/Bergen\nHartzell/Blair\nCicotte/Thoney\nGaspar/Clarke\nThomas/Coombs\nDowns/Odwell\nDoyle/Meyers\nSeymour/Dygert\nMcBride/Elberfled\nLeach/Gibson\nMattern/Graham\nGrant/McLean\nLush/Hauser\nHickman/Hinchman\nSummers/Jennings\nLake/Wallace\nWalsh/Payne\n\nLet me know if you have any of these and are interested in making a trade!\n\nRegards,\n\nMike",
