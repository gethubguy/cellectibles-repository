      "post_content": "One of the really difficult cards in a very difficult set to try to find. The Magee is often mentioned as the 2nd toughest card to only the Henry and along with Henry and Lelivelt, carries the lowest population count between PSA and SGC with 6 examples combined. \n\nConditionwise, the card is still very displayable too with a tiny pinhole at the top and a mild scrape at the bottom to account for the 10 holder. Back is clean and damage free.\n\nWhen I bought this card originally, about 7-8 years ago, there was a strong premium for cards such as this one, Lelivelt, etc...  As a result, I paid well over a grand for it, but I realize it's probably not worth that now.  So, I'll list my asking price as $800 OBO and will leave it open to cash and trade offers.  I haven't collected t222s in quite some time so I'm hoping to find a new home for this one. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=150127&d=1403666912[/IMG]",
