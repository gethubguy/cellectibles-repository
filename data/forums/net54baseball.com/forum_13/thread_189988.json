      "post_content": "The thread I started recently about the \u201clargest trade you ever made\u201d got me thinking about the trade value of the T205 set I have built. It is currently the number one T205 Master Set on the SGC Registry. I figured with National coming up next month in Cleveland, it would be an easy task to bring it to the show if someone was interested in trading. I live two hours away.\n\nI am ready to move on to a different collecting interest and looking to trade for 1- 2 prewar cards preferably graded by SGC of equal value.  With all the public auction sales information, Ebay and of course our own BST, I will let you gather what you determine the value is on your side, so I will respectfully not post my \u201ctrade value\u201d here today. Trust me I have a number.\n\nI will say it is missing only the elusive \u201cHoblitzell No Stats\u201d and has the only one of a kind T205 Eddie Collins \u201cYellow Elephant\u201d in the hobby. In my opinion, there are 15-20 cards that could receive a bump if the new owner so desires to send them in.\n\nI am not looking to sell, dump it to get money, nor am I desperate to break it up either. I am looking to offer someone a once in a life-time opportunity card to own a T205 Master Set and I will receive what I never could have purchased when I started collecting in 2001\u2026. a rare high grade prewar card beyond my wildest expectations. \n\nConfidentiality is important and would like for any contacts to be made through my email, [url]mattengle61@gmail.com[/url]. \n\nYou may view the set at my imageevent website, [url]http://www.imageevent.com/babybingbaseball[/url], scroll down to number 4.\n\nOther helpful information\n[url]http://sgccard.com/usersetcomposition.aspx?id=0&usersetid=1818[/url]\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt E.",
