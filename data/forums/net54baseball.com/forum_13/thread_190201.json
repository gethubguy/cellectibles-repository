Offering it here for $475 + $20 priority insured = $495  dlvd.\n\nThis card has good eye appeal for its grade (nicely centered, not too worn out looking, etc.)\n\n[url][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/nollpm/pre-war/5157/t205-phelps[/IMG][/url]\n\n[url][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/nollpm/pre-war/5158/t205-phelps-back[/IMG][/url]\n\n Thanks! -Pat",
