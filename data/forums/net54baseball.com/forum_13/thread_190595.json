Nunamaker (SGC 40) = [SOLD] $95 + $6 shipping.  (In 2012 this card with a Recruit back in a lower grade - SGC 30 - sold for $157.50)\n\n2. Gowdy (SGC 50) = $110 + $6 shipping.  (Last sale in this grade in 2012 went for $131).\n\nNow - only the Gowdy is left - feel free to make an offer!!! :eek:\n\n3. Perdue (SGC 50) = [SOLD!] $60 + shipping.  (Last 2 sold at auction in this grade for just over $63 each).\n\nPaypal accepted and preferred.  PM me - first to say \"I'll take it\" gets priority.  Then you have to pay...promptly :).\n\nThanks for looking!!!",
