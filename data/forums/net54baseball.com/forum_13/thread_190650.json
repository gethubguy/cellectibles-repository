      "post_content": "Up for sale is a lot of 27 T205 Piedmont commons.   Most are in good to VG/EX condition, w/ the exception of one of the Becks, which appears to have been trimmed on top.  Most are very nicely centered w/ very little chipping.\n\nThe lot does include a few key cards.  Doc Crandall is the rarer \"Crossed T\" variation.  Harry Krause is also a tougher card.  The Admiral Schlei has a Factory No 42 Piedmont back.\n\nLooking for $XXX for the lot, which works out to $XX.XX a card + a little for shipping.  I would prefer to not break up the lot, so please don't ask unless you are making a strong offer on a specific card.  Paypal friend /no fee is preferred.\n\nYou will not be disappointed in the quality of these cards.\n\nFirst to PM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] with an \"I'll take it!\" will be the new owner.\n\nSee scans below for condition or ask me if you need any additional details.\n\n[img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_1.jpg[/img][img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_1_back.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_2.jpg[/img][img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_2_back.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_3.jpg[/img][img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T205_Lot_3_back.jpg[/img]",

Any reason there's a slight premium for Krause (or is t205.org simply incorrect)?  Poor choice of words in my original post, for sure, but I'll leave it there since you called me out on it!  ;)",

      "post_content": "Derek,\nI think T205.org got it wrong...the Krause is not the easiest common to come by but it is certainly not tough or a single print...\n\nThe last three I bought were for under $15 each and ranged from fair to g-vg. Single prints in similar condition bring nearly twice that amount.\n\nGood luck with your lot...it is nice and I wish i had the money!\n\nJoshua",
