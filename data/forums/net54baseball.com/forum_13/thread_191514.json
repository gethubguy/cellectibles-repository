      "post_content": "Hello All,  I could post what I have but since I have less than a third of the set, chances are pretty good that I need what you might have to offer. I would be looking for either raw or slabbed. Slabs in the PSA 2.5/3.5; SGC35/45 range would work just fine. I am OK with Back Stamps.  I could be a \"little\" more flexible with raw. I would be looking for a nice fistful. PM me if you have something to offer. Thanks , Mike",
