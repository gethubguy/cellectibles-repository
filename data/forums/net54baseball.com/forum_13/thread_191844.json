      "post_content": "I went to the National looking to purchase one of the cards on my hit list, but was disappointed with the selection and the pricing. I'm looking to buy a T207 Speaker, T205 Mathewson, and T205 Johnson with eye appeal. I can't afford to buy all 3 at once, but looking to buy one now.  I don't care if they're graded as long as they have good eye appeal. \n\nThey are for my personal collection as I am trying to recreate \"The 1909-1953 Burdick Collection\" poster with as many real cards as I can afford over the next few years. \n\nThanks,\nMike",
