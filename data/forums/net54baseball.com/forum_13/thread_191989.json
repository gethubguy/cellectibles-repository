Notable features are...\n\n+ Full borders that fill the holder.\n\n+ Great centering.\n\n+ Great registration (many specimens have red ink shifted onto the white ball). \n\nNot many examples in any grade with all three of these key attributes. \n\n$1750 firm, shipped and insured. \n\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/mattianc/the-collection/18045/1911-t205-ty-cobb[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx58/mattianc/11T205CobbBack007_zpsc818d012.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks for looking, fellas.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt",
