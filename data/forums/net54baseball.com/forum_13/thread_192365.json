Working from my phone is rather difficult and I miss things. I can't do much more than say sorry.\n\nedit - simple tasks are taking me 10 times as long because I am using my phones connection and have no keyboard",

      "post_content": "Sean, it's fine.  This just reminded me of several 'no response' situations that have come up over the last few months.  My thinking was that it's possible forum members just aren't aware that they should respond, even if they are NOT interested in something.  I had a roommate in college who, if asked a question, would sometimes respond: \"I don't care\".  I was always disturbed by that.\n\nRegarding the cards - I have sold most of those T207's on ebay over the last few days, which is weird as they had been sitting around for months.  The offer I made you via PM was my cost + shipping.  It's still good for the remainder, but there aren't many left.",
