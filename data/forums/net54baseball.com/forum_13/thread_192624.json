      "post_content": "Hey all:\n\nI know, I know its the wrong forum but just trying to hit more folks.\n\nThis is in the prelim, but I need to gauge an interest if there is any. I made this poster of the entire set, all 168 cards including the 13 variations and 8 type 2s plus the OP backs to make an even 170. In the end, there were 6 cards I could not get images for and photshopped the differences, I just wanted the poster. Somehow the file wound up half the size and there is an ever so slight blur.\n\nI want to redo this, reacquire all the images and hand them over to a profession print shop that would produce the poster. It would be printed on thick poster paper, glossy, and have been professionally built as a file removing imperfections I couldn't dream of removing. It will be the same poster seen but even sharper. The poster would be 24 x 30\", $45 shipped in a tube and I need around 20 orders to actually make this work, no need for any money yet as I'm trying to gauge interest. Any thoughts and/or opinions are appreciated.",
