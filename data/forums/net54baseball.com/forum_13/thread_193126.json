Top and bottom measure 1 and 7/8ths across.\n\nIf your interested, please make an offer, I am also totally open to trades (and will chip in cash for the right item)\n\nLooking for the following\n*Ty Cobb T206 Bat Off (ideally looking for low grade to match up with the others I have) \n*Unusual Ted Williams Memorabilia (also looking for 1940-41 playballs)\n*higher end Hall of fame autograph stuff (preferably flats)\n\nPM me if interested\n\nMany Thanks ! \nDave\n\nPS-Sorry for the scans, my computer is acting funny",
