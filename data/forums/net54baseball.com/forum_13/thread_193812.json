      "post_content": "Hey guys,  I'm getting itchy to finish my 05 set, starting with finishing off the commons.  I want cards in good shape, good as in psa 2, though they need not be graded.  Even strong fair would be ok.  Looking to spend 17-24 per card depending on condition, a little writing or paper loss is ok.Cards I need: Archer, Bransfield, Corridon, Daubert, Graham, Gray, D.Jones, Leach, H.lord, Lush, McBride, Merkle, Mitchell, Moriarty, Pfeister, Sone, Stovall, Willett.  Paypal f/f.  pm me with what you have to offer.  Thanks!",
