All do present very nicely!\n\nUpdated so only those described here are still avaialble.\n\n\nHal Chase Too Late - Amby McConnell and Matty McIntyre - SGC 30 - light wear but nothing major - looks nice - $45\n\nScoring From Second - Rube Oldring and Bris Lord - SGC 30 - crease in the middle but not too bad - $45\n\nShipping is included in the prices and any payment form is accepted.  Shoot me a PM with any questions - thanks for looking!\n\nScott",
