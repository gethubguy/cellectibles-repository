      "post_content": "Here's the thing. After chasing the monster for a couple years, I have stalled at a MN of 491.9. You can guess which \"Dawgs\" are left. To avoid divorce court, I have been satisfying my addiction with T207, T210 and T212. I have made a little headway on all three fronts but still need a boatload. I won't post a want list as it would be overwhelming. I have 78 T207, 126 T210, 66 T212-2 and a whopping 12 T212-3. I didn't include the Red Borders in the title of this thread as I have had good luck with them most recently and the proverbial BST well might be dry on those for now. If you have some of those I would not be averse to grabbing some but I figured I would test the waters on the T207 and two T212 sets. I am looking for a handful (of each?). Raw or slabbed, either is OK. I am looking for cards in the SGC 35/50: PSA 2.5-4 range (30s and 2s MAY work) Thank You in advance to any and all folks who may respond to this plea to feed my monkey.:).....Mike",
