      "post_content": "Tobacco card lot including T205 Cycles, T205 Matty Cycle,  and some T206s. I need to raise quick funds for unexpected reason.  Here is the list.  I would prefer to sell entire lot, but will break up this evening if need be.  PP gift, or overnight check or MO.  Some T205s cycle you can view under seller pastime08 on ebay listed in one lot. I do have images of the other cards and will post when I get home.  \n\nT205 matty cycle 30% loss on back P\nT205 Herzog cycle f-g\nT205 Chance cycle30% loss on back P\nT205 Lobert cycle clean back trimmed P\nT205 Gibson cycle spot loss back trimmed P\nT205 Shean cycle clean back trimmed P\nT205 Marquard 3% loss front, 5% loss back cycle P\nT205 Doolan cycle clean back P-F\nT205 Griffith cycle clean back F\nT205 Overall SC clean F\nT206 Stone SC VG\nT206 Geyer Tolstoi F-G\nT206 Bender no trees looks NRMT slight trim SC 350-460\nT206 M.

Last 2 cycle mattys PSA 1 sold $1300+ and $2600 and last SGC 10 sold for $2500.  I would like $2200 for the entire group.  Need to move it and would listen to REASONABLE offers.  Thanks in advance.",
