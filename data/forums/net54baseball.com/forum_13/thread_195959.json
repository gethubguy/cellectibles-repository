      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a nice, raw T3 Schmidt.  It won't be graded, so I don't need anything perfect.  Bright colors and a perfect registration are the most important features.  Please let me know what you have for sale.  In case you'd like to trade, I have a few raw T3s to barter with.\n\nPlease send scans and prices to me at [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url]\n\n\nThanks,\nCraig",
