I am far below normal prices on eBay, so while I'll entertain offers, preference will go to anyone saying they'll take it at the listed price. Payment via PayPal Friends and Family. Shipping/Insurance is $4 (for one or both). \n\n* 1912 T202 Hassan Triple Folder of Walter Johnson/Knight PSA 1 (honest wear and creases - no tears, holes, paper loss, writing, etc. - a very pleasing 1) - $125\n\n[URL=http://s274.photobucket.com/user/Manderson9999/media/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075633_zpsnaxcxakh.jpg.html][IMG]http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/Manderson9999/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075633_zpsnaxcxakh.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n*1913 Fatima Teams T200 Pittsburgh Nationals with Honus Wagner BVG 1.5 (again, no major flaws, just normal creases/wrinkles found on these - super nice image) - $175 SOLD!\n\n[URL=http://s274.photobucket.com/user/Manderson9999/media/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075647_zpsbagttdrf.jpg.html][IMG]http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/Manderson9999/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075647_zpsbagttdrf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s274.photobucket.com/user/Manderson9999/media/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075707_zps71pox8mk.jpg.html][IMG]http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/Manderson9999/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075707_zps71pox8mk.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s274.photobucket.com/user/Manderson9999/media/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075716_zpshoe7snet.jpg.html][IMG]http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/Manderson9999/Mobile%20Uploads/20141030_075716_zpshoe7snet.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nThanks!\nMark",
