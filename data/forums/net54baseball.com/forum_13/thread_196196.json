      "post_content": "Hello everyone I got into this set at in beginning of the summer and I just don't like the way I approached the set at all. Im trying to sell all my cards that I have collected to this point. I have 74 cards graded and ungraded ranging from 1-5 and some of the ungraded could get a 6 or even a 7! Every card has a readable back, that was a big one for me. The backs on the cards are Piedmont, Honest Long Cut,Polar Bear, Sovereign, Sweet Caporal and even 3 Cycle backs and 1 of them is a Joe Tinker. If anyone is interested in buying the whole bunch please PM me and i will give you a list and pictures. Thanks!\n\nIF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN DOING AROUND HALF THE LOT I WILL ENTERTAIN OFFERS AS WELL!\nIf anyone can do $SOLD on the lot the whole things yours. \nEddie Collins (Mouth Closed) Beckett 2.5\nHome Run Baker Beckett 2\nOscar Stange SGC 4\nJohn Dunn SGC 2\nJack Knight Sgc 3\nTris Speaker SGC 1.5\nJohn Rowan SGC 1.5\nR.W Marquard PSA 1\nWilliam Bergen PSA 1.5\nPaddy Livingston PSA 3\nJohn Titus PSA 2\nJoe Birmingham PSA 1.5\nJoe Tinker PSA 2 (Cycle)\nCharlie Hemphill PSA 1(Cycle)\nD.
