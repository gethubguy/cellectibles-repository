      "post_content": "For sale is this original Pirate Cigarettes pack without card (sorry, :(). Pack appears to have all of the original 10 cigarettes with tin foil wrap. Some of the tobacco inside the cigarettes has fallen out over time and continues to slowly trickle out of the pack's corners. Exterior of pack has great graphics and color and has the same image on the front of the pack as on the reverse of the very scarce t215 cards. Side of box is bent some, with that carrying over to a bent upper right corner on the back. Pack will be shipped in a hard plastic case.\n\n$SOLD shipped.\n\nI acquired this pack over last summer here in Michigan.\n\nPM me with questions or to purchase. Thanks...........Matt",
