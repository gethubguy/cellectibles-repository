      "post_content": "Have been retooling my collecting philosophies; type-carding grew into expanding certain issues like C46 (10-15 yrs ago) when their prices were attractive. Currently have 30, various condition; with Tom Hughes, the best SGC86. Just got done looking at Beckett's view of this card in its grade. I plan on attending the Chicago show this weekend; which finally brings me to my question. My 'retooling\"\" consists of focussing on acquiring only HOF E-candy cards from this point forward. Plan on keeping most of my HOF T-cards. I see Mr. Hughes having good trade value for a decent condition HOF E-card; but having doubts about giving up a NM+ T-card. Have always been \"\"buy, buy, buy\", but I am enjoying the small game of hunt, find and trade; can always sell on eBay anytime for cash flow, but I like the interactions with other collectors/dealers; the closest I'll get to the fun as a kid. Sorry for the long-windedness, but something tells me (my gut) that I should hold on to Hughes. Any thoughts from experience would be much appreciated, fellas. Thanks! Ben.",
