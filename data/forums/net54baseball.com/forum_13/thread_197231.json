When more than one card completes a deal, a modest shipping discount will be applied to the total.\n\nPlease note that \"I'll take it\" in Post #2 refers to last week's card and not Freddy.  Cards are removed when sold so that any card you see in this post is available.  When you say \"I'll take it\" perhaps indicating which card you are taking would be helpful.  \n\nThanks for looking.  The thread will be bumped every time time someone says\n\n\"I'll take it.\"  \n\nA PM (AM or PM, not FM) will work as well if you are modest.:p\n\nAll forms of no fee payment are acceptable.  Roughly 3% will be added for reg PP.\n\nThanks for looking and in advance for your interest.",
