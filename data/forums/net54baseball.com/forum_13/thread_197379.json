I could of course split up a whole card to get the middle panel, but I don't want to do that.\n\nThe scans below show what I have available for trade or sale.\nNote: I don't know what the \"gridwork\" is that appears irregularly on every card in the scan; it's the scan [This is the highest resolution Net54 allows me.  Maybe it's the plastic sleeves?]; there is no such gridwork on the cards.",
