Last time it was offered the listing was to have ended 11/17/14 but the listing was ended by the seller because the item was no longer available. That listing had a starting price of 249.99 but again it had been offered previously at much higher prices.  Maybe the seller found a buyer at or near 249.99 and pulled the card?  Since you are asking...\"What's a card like this worth? Any interest?\".... I assume you own it and I'd say it's worth less than 249.99.\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/1911-T201-Mecca-Double-Folders-Error-MISCUT-Mcginnity-Mccarty-BVG-Not-PSA-T206-/171539302044?pt=US_Baseball&hash=item27f08a069c[/url]",

That's why there are obnoxious price tags on these types of cards. I say go for the gold and get as much as you can...everyone else does. \n\nGlyn, my first post was in jest, but you get the point. \n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
