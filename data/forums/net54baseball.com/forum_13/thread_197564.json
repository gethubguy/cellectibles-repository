      "post_content": "Here's the thing. After chasing the monster for a couple years, I have stalled at a MN of 497.9. You can guess which \"Dawgs\" are left. To avoid divorce court, I have been satisfying my addiction with T207, T210 and T212. I have made a little headway on all three fronts but still need a boatload. I originally didn't post a want list as I thought it would be overwhelming, but I have been asked to narrow it done a bit. I have 89 T207, 134 T210, and 77 T212-2. I am looking for a handful (of each?). Raw or slabbed, either is OK. I am looking for cards in the SGC 35/50: PSA 2.5-4 range (30s and 2s MAY work) Thank You in advance to any and all folks who may respond to this plea to feed my poor, starving monkey......Mike\n\nI hope these lists are not too crazy....
