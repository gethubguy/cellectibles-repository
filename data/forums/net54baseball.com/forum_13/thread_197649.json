      "post_content": "Guys........For sale is this t204 Ramly Wm. Dineen with a 'blank back'. The image is nice, but the card was originally mounted in a scrapbook and according to the previous owner, a 'book bug' ate the lower part of the card. Also, the lower name plate is barely hanging onto the card and is almost falling off on the left edge. Small tear on left border. Still a rare 'blank back' version. $49 delivered.\n\n**Payment by Paypal 'gift' preferred. PM me here with questions or to purchase. Thanks.........Matt",
