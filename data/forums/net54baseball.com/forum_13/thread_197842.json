(you also forgot the point on the email  when you would not counter the offer when i said i would wait for a price reduction on BST  which apparently happened but i never saw it) .still dont know why you would bring up a first offer when you dont talk about the price you wanted at the time..funny...\n\nplus i just joking around....as the PSA 5 jackie sold for 1000 more than i asked for it on here.....i dont think your net loss on the T202 is the same situation.that was the joke....dont take it so personal man...(you trying to find old email offers..haha)",

I remember your offer, I don't need to read old emails.  When someone offers half of what a card is worth, I usually don't bother countering, because I know it isn't going anywhere.

If someone is willing to pay a list price, then to me that's as good a definition of a market price as any; or if it isn't, then I guess I don't care what a market price is or isn't.  You seem very focused on the concept of market price, I guess I am not really sure why.  BTW if you or I  or anyone else here had put that Jackie on ebay starting at 9.99 it goes nowhere close to that price, in my opinion.  Why that is, don't get me started.\n\nPS I think I started the Speaker at 600 as I had pointed out the last one sold at 630 which only would have been a helpful point if I had been asking less.",
