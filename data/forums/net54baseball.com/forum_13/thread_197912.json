      "post_content": "SOLD. Thanks to all who took a look.\n\nEnjoys a similar design to T205, all but three players were 'borrowed'  from there. As thin as a postage stamp, the gummed backing was meant to be moistened and pasted - hence the paper loss on the reverse.  The front speaks for itself although there is a very slight horizontal crease that cuts across his neck (Oh, poor Tris!) that I imagine occurred upon peel-off. Very tough issue to find in any sort of decent condition, you would be hard pressed to find a Speaker at anywhere near this price. $139 includes shipping. Thanks for looking.",
