      "post_content": "Thanks to many folks on the board, my previously posted want list is nearly filled (and then some). Down to two cards needed - picking these two up in 2014 would cap the year:  Grade is - honestly - not important in the least ... would like the back to be readable, though:\n\nLooking for two cards:\n\n  * Livingston - \"Big C\" - Recruit, Factory 606.  I used to own a copy and traded it away about 4 years ago ... would be nice to get a copy back.\n  * Bushelman - Broadleaf.  SGC 40+ would be great, but I'll take *anything*\n\nI have plenty to trade (T207's mostly), and cash if there's nothing of interest.\n\nHope to hear from someone so I can close out the year with a sigh of relief ... this is a monkey I'd like to have done with ...\n\nThanks!\n--\nMike",
