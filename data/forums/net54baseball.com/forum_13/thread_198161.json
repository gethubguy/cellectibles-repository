      "post_content": "Spent too much money this year, so no more buying! However, I am still open to trading. I am looking for pre-war HOFers (any grade), post-war HOF RCs, post-war autographed RCs and autos of pre-war stars like 1960/61 Fleer, etc.\n\nIn particular, I am trying to get a collection finished of all HOF players. Cards must be period to their playing days (i.e. no later \"tribute\" or HOF type cards). I need several 19th century players but I won't even bother listing them here as I doubt anyone will be trading them to me. But here is a list of others I specifically need:\n\nBobby Wallace \nEarle Combs\nElmer Flick\nHack Wilson \nHal Newhouser \nJack Chesbro \nStan Coveleski \nPhil Niekro 1964 Topps\n\nLike I said, I am interested in any pre-war HOFers so feel free to send any scans or lists my way.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some specific cards I am trading/selling. I do have a lot more, so ask if you have specific wants. Scans are available for most everything.\n\nCARDS/PREMIUMS:\n\n1909 T206 Sweet Caporal 150 Overprint Factory 649 Clark Griffith BVG 1\n1910 T213 Coupon Cigarettes Type I Miller Huggins Portrait BVG 1\n1910 W-UNC Johnny Evers BVG 1\n1911 T205 Sweet Caporal Red Mordecai Brown (Raw - G range)\n1919-21 W514 Walter Johnson BVG 1.5\n1921 W461 Exhibits Dave Bancroft (currently at BVG, probably a 2-3)\n1923 W515-2 Wilbert Robinson (Raw - Poor)\n1932-33 Worch Cigar Joe Cronin (Raw - Poor)\n1933 R319 Goudey Waite Hoyt (Raw - G to VG range)\n1933 R319 Goudey Carl Hubbell #234 (Raw - Poor due to some stampings)\n1934 R & J Hill Tris Speaker BVG 6.5\n1934 R310 Butterfinger Premiums Jim Bottomley (Raw - Poor)\n1934 R310 Butterfinger Premiums Waite Hoyt (Raw - Poor)\n1934-36 R327 Diamond Stars Kiki Cuyler (Raw - Fair)\n1936-42 Anonymous 5x7 Premium Black Borders Jimmie Foxx (Raw - EX)\n1940 R335 Play Ball Earl Averill (Raw - Poor)\n1946-47 Cuban Sol De Oro Club Almendares Team Premium Buck O'Neill/etc. (11 Negro Leaguers, 10 MLB, 15 Cuban HOF) (Raw - Fair)\n1948 R421 Swell Babe Ruth Story Babe Ruth & William Bendix (Card #1) SGC 3\n1960-65 Yankee Stadium Souvenir Shop Postcard Overprint Error Lou Gehrig (Raw - EX/MT)\n1960-65 Yankee Stadium Souvenir Shop Postcard Lou Gehrig (Raw - EX/MT)\n1961 Golden Press Babe Ruth ( Raw - Fair)\n1961 Golden Press Lou Gehrig (Raw - Fair)\n1961 Nu Cards Baseball Scoops Lou Gehrig (Raw - Good)\n1964 Gold Hall of Fame Plaques Lou Gehrig (Raw - NM/MT)\n1964 Gold Hall of Fame Plaques Babe Ruth (Raw - NM/MT)\n1991 Topps Desert Shield Mike Blowers\n1972-73 Topps Rebound Leaders (Julius Erving, Artis Gilmore & Mel Daniels) BVG 8\n1972-73 Topps Oscar Robertson BVG 8\n\n\nSETS:\n\n1940-42 Editorial Bruguera Famous Sportsmen Spanish Card Set, all BVG graded - highest set on record - with: Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Max Baer, Max Schmeling, etc.\n\n\nAUTOGRAPHED CARDS:\n\n1951 Topps Red Back Bob Feller Slabbed JSA/BVG Authentic\n1953 Bowman Black & White Extension Bob Feller with JSA COA\n1953 Bowman Black & White Extension Warren Spahn with JSA COA\n1960 Fleer Baseball Greats Johnny Mize \n1983 Donruss HOF Heroes Johnny Mize Slabbed JSA/BGS Authentic\n1983 Donruss HOF Heroes Carl Hubbell\n1992 Front Row All Time Greats Monte Irvin\n1993 Ted Williams Card Co.
