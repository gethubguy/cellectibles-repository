      "post_content": "I have saved my Christmas pennies, returned a few items and have scraped enough to finally purchase (hopefully) the last card for my T205 HOFer set (of course with the exception of the rarer variations like the Cycle 1 Loss and the 1 Line of Stats).  \n\nPutting a request out to buy the T205 Cy Young, low-grade.  Prefer graded PSA/SGC in 1/1.5 (minimal paper loss if possible). May be able to afford the right 2. Raw works also as long as I can grade it. Authentic also works, except excessive trimming. Please send PM message or email with scans. \n\nThanks, Dave",
