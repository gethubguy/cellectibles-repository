      "post_content": "All,\n\nLooking to expand my low grade T205 collection.  I need about 2/3 of the set and can easily generate a list.  If interested in putting together a deal,  PM me and we can work something out.\n\nSo, here's the twist.  Thanks to my family, I recently received some eBay gift cards for Christmas.  Since buying on eBay is such a pain, I'd rather put that money into the Net54 community and BST.  So, I'd like to work something out with a seller willing to process any transaction through an eBay BIN.  I'll pay all of the fees.  After we agree on a package, all you would need to do is create a BIN and I'll pay it with my gift cards.  Simple as that.\n\nLet me know if interested and I can send you my need list.\n\nThanks,\nJoe",
