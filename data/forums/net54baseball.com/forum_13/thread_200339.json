Most likely a 3 or a 4 (maybe a 5 on a  good day)\n\n1911 T201 Mecca # 39 Hughie Jennings / Ed Summers\n\nMiscut with 2 images of Hall of Famer Hugh Jennings as shown. Other side is miscut as well as you can see the faint line to the right of Summer's throwing hand.\n\nMake offers if interested. Thanks!
