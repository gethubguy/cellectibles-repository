The backs that I'm aware of that I don't yet have are:\n\nHonest Long Cut\nPolar Bear\nAmerican Beauty\n\nNow I know that last one is a long shot, but the other two can't be *that* difficult, can they? Anyway, I'm not looking for anything super high grade, just presentable, preferably with no paper loss (chipping and creases aren't much of a problem for me). If you have anything for sale (and accept PayPal) please let me know!\n\nThanks,\n\nRichard.",

I'm guessing if another one surfaces there's going to be a lineup of people interested, but it won't stop me from asking ;)\n\nHere's hoping I can at least get one of the others I'm looking for.\n\nCheers,\n\nRichard.",
