      "post_content": "Neat Old Mill Cabinets coupon with back checklist.  Condition is VG, but very presentable overall.  $35.00 shipped.\n\nAlso have a trimmed box front from a Tolstoi cigarette pack.  Common practice of the time for pasting in a scrapbook.  Inexpensive alternative to a full pack!  Also, please note the box front displays much better than photographed - there are some funky shadows going on there!  $45.00 shipping.\n\nTake both for $75.",
