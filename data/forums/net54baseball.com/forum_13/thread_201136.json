Centering is perfect, sharp registry, and the back is clear and bright. Only a bit of chipping on the corners stops it from hitting a higher grade.\n\nI am only selling because I am bidding on the Goldin auction ending this weekend, and need some dry powder. Asking $120 shipped- a very nice deal. [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=178030&d=1423195692[/IMG]",
