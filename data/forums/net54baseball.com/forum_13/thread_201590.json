No major creases, stains, etc. but wear along the edges and corners.\n\nRaymond - $80 Piedmont 25 short print (sold)\nStovall - $35 Sweet Cap\nReulbach - $40 Cycle (sold)\nBescher - $35 Sweet Cap (t206 holder)\nLord - $35 Piedmont 25 (t206 holder)\n\nI am willing to discount for multiples - $65 for 2, $90 for all 3 if purchased by Monday. Prices include shipping.\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=179060&d=1423932614[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=179061&d=1423932629[/IMG]",
