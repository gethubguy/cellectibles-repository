      "post_content": "Need to liquidate some cards for a possible purchase so here it goes.  Nice card for the grade.  Vibrant colors and minimal creasing (scan does not do card justice).  The line to the left of the card on the scan is not there, it is from the scanner.  SGC 35 of same card recently sold on eBay for $75.  I am looking for $75 + $3 S/H in bubble mailer.  Prefer PP F&F but regular PP ok as well.  PP address is [url]mcantista@gmail.com[/url].  Please respond via PM only.  I will be listing a few T206's and some 50's autographed cards too.  Thanks, Mike.\n\n[IMG]http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e230/tistaT206/NY%20Amer%20T-Cards/WarhopT213-2reverse-1.jpg[/IMG]",
