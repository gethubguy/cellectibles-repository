      "post_content": "I have three duplicate T212-2's (Baum, Byrd, and Hogan) that I wouldn't mind trading for something. As you can see from the scans, all three cards have creases, and Byrd and Hogan have back problems, though a good soak might help. Byrd also appears to be trimmed.\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for other T212's, though I wouldn't mind them (I have 50 besides these three). I have very eclectic collecting interests, as I described in my introductory thread linked here:\n\n[url]http://net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=201419[/url]\n\nI prefer raw cards, since I don't have any prewar slabbed cards, and I value eye appeal over more technical considerations (e.g. I don't mind a crease or two or three, as long as a card presents reasonably well).\n\nPM me with any interest/offers.\n\n[IMG]http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg98/dkathman1/IMG_20150222_0007.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg98/dkathman1/IMG_20150222_0008.jpg[/IMG]",
