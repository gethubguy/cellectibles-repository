      "post_content": "If you are condition-sensitive, there's nothing to see here. Move along. \n\nIf, on the other hand, you want a truly rare card, come inside and take a look. It looks as though it's been through a hurricane or two (Betsy? Camille?), and I can't swear it was never placed under a leg to level a chiffarobe or folded into a tube for delivery by carrier pigeon, but hey, it's a Mino. \n\nThis is perhaps the only surviving Mino Bridwell (no other copies graded by SGC or PSA). It is, as they say, a true \"1 of 1, highest graded!\"\n\nSo if you like tough T types and Louisiana types and Federal Leaguers and deadball era utility infielders and guys who finished 2nd in the NL to Honus Wagner in position player WAR one year (1909), well, this is the card you've been waiting for.\n\nBut wait, there's more:\n\nEnglish: habitational name from some minor place called Brid(e)well, as for example Bridwell in Uffculme, Devon, or Bridewell Springs in Westbury, Wiltshire; both are named with Old English br\u00afd \u2018surging\u2019 or br\u00afd \u2018bride\u2019 + well(a) \u2018spring\u2019 (perhaps a spring associated with a fertility cult).(ancestry.com)\n\nBeat that!\n\nYours now for $SOLD.",
