(As far as \"MK\" designations go, I think the small mark on the reverse in the lower-right corner is about as unobtrusive as you can get.)\n\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment. (Check, cash, money order also OK and preferred).\n\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes: \n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com[/URL]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/t205-cobb.jpg[/IMG]",
