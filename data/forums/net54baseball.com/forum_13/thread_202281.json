I'll post pictures when I can or by email which may be quicker as I have them on my phone.\n\n1. Chief Meyers - polar bear back\n2. Frank Lang - sweet caporal back\n3. Ed Reulbach - polar bear back\n4. Ed Willett - polar bear back\n5. George Stone - sweet caporal back\n\nOpen to anything really as my main focus is t206 not t205's I've decided to see what I could get for them. All cards are non graded and poor to fair condition.\n\n[url]https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/1...47956845705937[/url]\n\nAdditionally I have these listed on eBay \"Foleyisgod4ever\" is my eBay handle. You can take a look at them there. I just listed them a couple days ago. Either would like to get money for them or trade them to get low grade (SGC/PSA) t206's. \n\nLink to the Pictures",
