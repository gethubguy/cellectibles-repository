      "post_content": "Hi Group,\n\nLong shot here but I am interested in obtaining different backs for My T207 Cubs collection.  Currently have the typical Recruit back and 2 anonymous back cards so looking for a Cub in potentially a Naploeon or Broadleaf back if anyone has one.  The player is not particullarly inportant and the back must have some eye appeal and cost should not be anything too scary.  Let me know.  PM me or email at [url]cubkmac32@aol.com[/url].\n\nKmac",
