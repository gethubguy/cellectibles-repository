I would guess most will grade around a 2, but present well.\n\nGardner - $20 (no creases, paper loss on back)\nHanford Hassan - $25 (minor league)\nMiller - $18 (very minor paperless on back)\nTitus - $15 (paper loss on back)\nDunn Hassan - $30 (light vertical crease)\nMurphy - $20\nSchlei - $20\nHartsell - $18\nSnodgrass - $23 (probably a 3 grade) (Honest LC)\nSchulte - $20\nLatham - $15\nKnight - $20 (Sweet Cap)\nWolter - $20\nBell - $20 (Sweet Cap)\nHoffman - $20 (Sweet Cap)\n\nShipping is $3 per order, with tracking. Those who have dealt with me know I am a fast shipper, with very safe packaging. I will accept paypal or check. Prices are firm if buying individually, I am open to offers for multiples. I would accept $250 for the lot. Look for more from me this week.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=183262&d=1426645320[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=183263&d=1426645332[/IMG]",
