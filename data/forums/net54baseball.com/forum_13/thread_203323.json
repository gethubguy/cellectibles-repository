Listed below are my current set needs.\n\nI am not condition sensitive, I figure I be more selective when doing upgrades at a later date.\n\nBlack AB\nBELL\nLATHAM\nOLMSTEAD\nWHEAT\n\nGreen AB:\nCHANCE\nCOBB\nEVERS\nGIBSON\nHEMPHILL\nKROH\nMARQUARD\nMATHEWSON\nMERKLE\nMILLER\nREULBACH\nSCHLEI\nSCHULTE\nSNODGRASS\nTINKER\n\nCobb is my lowest priority as it doesn't seem to be rare at all, but sellers seem to put a price tag on it like it is. Therefor it may be the only one I don't pursue unless I can find one for, what I deem, a reasonable price.\n\nI have the following duplicates for trade:\n\nPASKERT,GEORGEBLACK\nAUSTIN,JIMMYBLACK\nBRIDWELL,A.H.BLACK\nOLDRING,RUBEGREEN\nSUMMERS,EDGREEN\nPHILLIPPE,CGREEN",
