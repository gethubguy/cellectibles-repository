Apparently it looks like they got mixed up with another card or cards he was sending out.  I trust the seller and his explanation that this was probably a simple mix up, and he has refunded my money, so I'm out nothing.  I just wanted to post them here in case anyone happens see them up for sale, or may have even received them.  Thanks",

Like said, I'm out no money here, but would have still hoped whoever received these would come forward.  Oh well, I snagged another Powell from Belltown (thanks Scott), so now just need to find me a Zamlock.",
