This was purchased to be part of my collection, but I recently came across a full pack, so now have the duplicate available.\n\nComes complete with the inner slide plus a full 1910 tax stamp (1909 series).  99% certainty this would have held a card.  Condition-wise, they don't get better!\n\nSOLD",
