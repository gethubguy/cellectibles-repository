      "post_content": "I was looking at the T207 Yerkes card and although it is listed as Stanley Yerkes - the bio is definitely about Steve Yerkes ... Stanley retired 9 years before the T207 series & never played in Boston and Steve was a rookie that year - IN BOSTON - like the card states ... and since the card talks about a young Boston infielder, I am certain this is Steve and NOT Stan\n\n\n So, is this just an uncorrected error that has NOT been updated by Beckett or any otf the card catalogs ... or am I just wrong?",
