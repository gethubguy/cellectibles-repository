      "post_content": "Im thinking of letting go of this near complete Series 4 set. Looking to move as a lot only. This set is very comparable in overall condition to the one just sold in REA. Actually about a half grade better assuming the raw set was graded accurately [url]http://bid.robertedwardauctions.com/bidplace.aspx?itemid=33823[/url]\n\nWith the benefit of already having 41 of the 45 cards SGC graded. The breakdown is\n\nSGC 30+=29 cards with 18 above SGC 40\nSGC 20 and under=12 cards none trimmed\n\n[url]http://www.sgccard.com/usersetcomposition.aspx?id=0&usersetid=6945[/url]\n\nRaw Cards\n\nBrumfield F\nCochrane F\nMollenkamp VG\nMoye F\n\nThis set needs only Aylor, Benny, Canepa, and Dougherty for completion. \n\n\nIll start with offers for the set from interested parties. I do have a price in mind. I will entertain trades/partial trades as well. Please message me to discuss further. Thank you",
