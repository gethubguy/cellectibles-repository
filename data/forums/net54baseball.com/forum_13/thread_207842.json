      "post_content": "Seems like we're always looking for ways to display our cards or memorabilia.  I've made these for myself for the past couple of years and I thought I'd throw them out there to see if there is any interest for anybody else.  \n\nIn short, here are some details:\n\nSolid Oak, dovetailed corners, Mahogany spline-reinforced miters, French cleat system to hang flush to your wall, adjustable hinges, latch or latchless, knob or knobless, black felt covered rear panel.\n\nYou can provide your own glass or I can provide plexiglass at cost.  This one holds 12 of your most valuable cards (made for SGC and PSA holders).  Roughly 29\"x23\" in size.  Different sizes or variations can be made (I have a 36\"x36\" that holds 60 cards that lean on a rail instead of being secured on top/bottom).  Local pickup to Pittsburgh, PA/Northern WV is preferable but can also ship from zip 15212.\n\nLooking for $185 + shipping for a glassless, 12 card case as shown.  This is less than $10/hour in labor so I think it's a fair price.   Please allow me 4-6 weeks to complete a case (though I can make 2-3 at the same time).  This is just a hobby of mine.\n\nPM me or email [url]cwiersbicki@yahoo.com[/url] if you have interest!  Thanks!!",
