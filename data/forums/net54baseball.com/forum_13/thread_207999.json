The line to the right of the card on the scan is not there, it is from the scanner.  SGC 35 of same card recently sold on eBay for $75.  I am looking for $80. S/H in bubble mailer included in price.  Prefer PP F&F but regular PP ok as well.  ([url]mcantista@gmail.com[/url]).  Please respond via PM only.   Thanks, Mike.\n\n[IMG]http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e230/tistaT206/NY%20Amer%20T-Cards/WarhopT213-2reverse-1.jpg[/IMG]",
