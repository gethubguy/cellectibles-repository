This isn't eBay and we can't allow cards with questionable authenticity to be sold on BST.  I realize that ungraded cards are sold here all the time but they are done so by individuals who are willing to stand behind their cards and offer a full refund if they turn out to be counterfeit.  Standing by and letting someone potentially be out several hundred dollars isn't something I'm willing to do.\n\nThanks for understanding and nothing personal...\n\n-Brian",
