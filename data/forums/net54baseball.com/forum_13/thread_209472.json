      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following T209 card of Jenkins, Greenville available for sale.  Card is obviously low grade due to the paper loss on the front and pencil writing on the back, but the player image is still nice and the back is flawless besides the neatly written player name.  This is an inexpensive way to pick up one of these tougher type cards.  \n\n**CARD IS SOLD**\n\nThanks for looking and please feel free to send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions or to reserve cards.",
