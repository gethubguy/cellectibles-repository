      "post_content": "Hi everyone I posted this over in the photo sell thread also.  This is a cabinet photo of the maysville rivermen circa 1910-1916 the years they were active in the bluegrass league and ohio state league.  It is possible it is one of a kind.  It does have some damage as photo shows.  I picked this up from fellow board member a few years ago.  I am asking less than I paid for it.\n\nI am asking 200.00 plus 10 for priority shipping.  If interested or you want to make an offer message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks\n\nWilliam",
