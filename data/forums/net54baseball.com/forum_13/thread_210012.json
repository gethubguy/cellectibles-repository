      "post_content": "Hi, I stopped selling these cards due to time it takes to research but I'm trying again. (Sorry, I'm not in the hobby, just helping my grandmother!) \nI just did a search and saw this card sold on HA for $4302.00. Granted, it was graded PSA 8. I understand that a value will jump significantly with the higher grades but this caught me off guard. \nI have this card but SGC graded at 80 (PSA 6 equivalent?). Any suggestions on a value (and I know... only worth what someone is willing to pay ;) )? It's been a long time so bear with me as I try to upload pictures. I will try again if I screw this up. \n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=200793&d=1439472751[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=200794&d=1439472770[/IMG]",

      "post_content": "It's a great looking card - I would estimate the SGC 80 (6) would get about $750.  \n\nThere are no recorded sales of SGC 80, but PSA 6's have been in that range.   An SGC 5 sold for $440, and an SGC 7 sold in 2010 for $1,440, so fair to think an attractive 6 would be in the $750 range based on that.",
