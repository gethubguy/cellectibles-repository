      "post_content": "Sorry for the small scans. :rolleyes:\n\nI think the scans of the backs are a bit washed out. I can tell you that the discoloration on the reverse of the Joss is darker than what appears in the scan. Plus, the back of the Young scan just looks funny to me. But in person, the back looks just like any other T3. \n\nThe reason for the low grade on the Young is a small tear at about 10 or 11 o'clock. I bought this card years ago already graded, so I can't say how significant the tear is (having not seen it raw). I can say that looking at the front of the card in the slab, it's really tough to see.\n\nThe Joss, as you can see in the scan, is ungraded. The \"professional\" grading of T3s always has puzzled me. I would guess that depending on which grader is throwing darts on which day, mine could grade a 2, 2.5 or 3. I tried to come up with a fair price based on that.\n\nJoss, ungraded, $550 \n\nRhoades, PSA 2 (MK), $675\n\nCy Young, PSA 1, $800\n\nPrices are delivered within the United States only\n\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment. (Check, cash, money order also OK and preferred).\n\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. \n\nFeel free to [URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]email any questions[/URL].\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com[/URL]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-joss-front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-joss-back.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-rhoades-front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-rhoades-back.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-young-front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/private/forsale/t3-young-back.jpg[/IMG]",
