      "post_content": "DISCLOSURE:  These cards were pasted on paper.  After jumping the gun on Daubert, I realized the glue was water soluble, but very heavy and thick.  Therefore, I soaked them over night in tap water.  I assume (:rolleyes:) that the type of glue radically effected the red ink.  As the Red Sweet Caporal are barely visible (but there, with some paper loss).  The Dougherty (red sock emblem) is now a total FREAK, going from red to light pink.  I consider these all ALTERED cards.\n\nDougherty gone, other 7 up as lot on ebay -- sg713\n\n\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThanks, Scott\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=204308&d=1441908632[/IMG]",
