      "post_content": "Nice card with a touch of light corner and edge wear (most pronounced at lower right corner and edge). There are no creases however the upper surface does show some faint wrinkles/lines when viewed up close. PLEASE NOTE - what appears to be wear at left edge in the scan is actually a series of flaws which were in the original negative off of which this was developed and are printed into the image border. This includes the line which runs from upper left corner down which actually appears far more pronounced in the image but is not so bold when card is held in hand. It will be packaged carefully and shipped USPS with signature confirmation. Please PM to purchase or with questions/offers. Paypal only.\n\nASKING - $165",
