(I do realize that Justin is looking for some of these in another thread -- the REA examples that he and I both need would be upgrades for me, so I would have dupes available that he's cool with.)\n\nT211s I'm looking for from REA last night:\nLot 257: Hickman\nLot 260: Bay, Seitz\nLot 261: Bernhard\nLot 262: Foster\n\n===============\n\nT211s that I have available for trade are: DeMontreville (SGC 40), Fritz (SGC 35).  (And I have a bunch of other cards from different sets, let me know what you are looking for.  Also always willing to buy outright.)\n\n===============\n\nOther T211s I'm looking for:\nBartley (upgrade needed from SGC A)\nCohen (upgrade needed from SGC 10)\nE. DeMontreville\nFisher (upgrade needed from trimmed card in SGC 40)\nGribbin (upgrade needed from SGC 10)\nHanks (upgrade needed from SGC A)\nHess (upgrade needed from SGC 20)\nKane\nManush (upgrade needed from SGC A)\nSeabourgh (upgrade needed from SGC A)\nSmith (upgrade needed from SGC A)\nThomas\nWalker (upgrade needed from SGC A)\n\nThank you for any help,\nSteve",
