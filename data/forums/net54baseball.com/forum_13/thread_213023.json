      "post_content": "The 16 ungraded range from Poor to Good.\n\nI'd rather trade. I am continually upgrading [looking for many hall-of-famers, SL's, SP's, Fair-Good or better, commons, G-VG or better], also interested in T206's.  So, if you're interested in trading, let me know what you have. I prefer ungraded cards.\n \nThe ungraded commons range in price from $10-$20, hall-of-famers, $30-50.  The Bobby Wallace, no cap, I have yet to figure out.\nIf you're interested in an individual card/cards, let me know and I'll give you a price. I'll reserve cards for sale as of now.
