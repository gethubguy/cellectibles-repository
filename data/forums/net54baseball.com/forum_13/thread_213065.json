      "post_content": "I just did an inventory of my 1910 Obaks, and found that I have 23 of the 35 slogans that appear on the card backs. Here are the ones I need:\n\nCigarettes of Quality\nDelicate Aromatic\nEveryone Satisfies\nFor Exacting Smokers\nImmensely Popular\nInstantly Popular\nJust Right\nMais Paper Wrapper\nMarvelous Blend\nPerfect Flavor\nSurpass Imagination\nThe Story In The Smoking\n\nIf anybody out there happens to have a spare 1910 Obak with one of these slogans that you're willing to sell, I'd be mighty pleased if you could let me know.\n\nEdited to add that I generally prefer raw cards, since all of my other Obaks are raw, but I would be open to graded cards.",
