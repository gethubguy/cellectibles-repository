      "post_content": "Edit 10/29/15:\nI've decided that I may sell this card.  The problem is its hard to find any comparable sales to use as a judge of value.  I'm going to list it will a high price OBO and seif I can get some idea of the value.  Basically, I just want to find a fair price for it.  But if it ends up being worth like $300 - $400 then I would just keep it because its worth more to me than that.\n\nIf any t205 experts see this and want to send me a PM with some price advice, I would appreciate it.  Hopefully I can figure this out quickly.\n\nPrice: $750 obo\n\nI'm considering trading my BL Huggins.  I'm only looking for a few specific cards from the T206 set.  I'm not interested in selling it.  I can add cash or other cards to make a deal work if necessary. \n\n\n\nLooking to knock one of these bigger cards off my 150-350 want list.  Looking for Good or better with nice eye appeal:\n\nBender portrait Old Mill\nCrawford throwing Old Mill\nElberfeld Wash (Old Mill)\nEvers blue sky (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nKeeler bat Old Mill\nLajoie port (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nMatty white cap (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nMatty port (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nTinker port (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nTinker hands on knees (Hindu, Old Mill)\nWaJo port (non Pied/SC/Sov350)\nYoung bare hand with one of these backs (Old Mill, EPDG, Sov150)",
