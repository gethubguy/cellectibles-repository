      "post_content": "Hello.  I am looking to acquire a nice T205 Cobb.  I am looking for a graded example in the 3-5 range that has strong registration and mostly intact gold borders.  SGC or PSA is perfectly acceptable and I will surely pay a price commensurate with a \"high end\" card.  Back type is not important.\n\nPlease send me a PM to discuss further.  Thank you.  :)",
