      "post_content": "I won the lot of four rare T207 Recruit cards with brown ink printing on the reverse in the very recent REA auction (Lot #235) in order to get the WaJo card for my WaJo collection. The other three cards are for sale (will consider a trade). SGC noted \"Brown Back\" on the flip of only one of these three cards, but I assume SGC will revise the flip of the other two if requested to do so. If anyone wants a larger scan of any of these cards, please email me at [url]ekehl333@aol.com[/url]. Prices include shipping, with payment via check or m.o. - add 3% for PayPal payment (I don't accept Friends & Family for card sales):\n\nJake Daubert - SGC 50 - $280\nDel Gainor - SGC 60 - $325\nGeorge McBride - SGC 50 - $280",
