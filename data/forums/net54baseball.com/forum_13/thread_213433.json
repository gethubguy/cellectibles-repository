You said you were watching them.  So you know I picked up the SGC 45 for $234.  Stetson was plain as day saying he wanted that card.  I understand you're upper echelon and beyond having a low grade Kotton.

I saw your cards listed on ebid.  You have a pretty good idea what cards are worth  - as you have them priced that way as opposed to what you bought many of those for in the previous month or two.  It's no different.   You also have in your want list T216.  I haven't seen another T216 sell for $125 this year.  I'm not saying it hasn't happened...but I haven't seen it, and VCP hasn't seen it.  Nor did VCP pick up mine.  \n\nYou know what the cards went for on eBay, heck you asked about the Shean even though it's not for sale, all the while saying you shut down your eBay account.   I've already put the analogy out there...but if T206 beater Cobbs have been selling for $400 on a general basis over the last year and someone grabs one for $200 and tries to sell it here for $400, do you think you're really going to get it from them for $200?  Would you turn around and sell it for $200?  Going by your cards you have for sale, you would NOT.  \n\nAnd your comment last night with the \"Aaaand this offer has sunk\" was just you trying to pile on more.  \"After Leon chimed in, I was simply commenting that it now looked as though there was a slim chance you were going to sell those cards\".   Fact is, it wasn't Leon chiming in that derailed the cards being offered - it was you.   Go ahead and chime in on someone's cards for sale and state in the thread itself you will give them HALF what they are asking for.  Heck I was asking for what in my mind the cards have been selling for...there is plenty on here on the BST and on eBay alike that ask twice what cards have been selling for.   Have you thrown a bone at them??",
