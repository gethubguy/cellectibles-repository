      "post_content": "Guys.........Hello. For sale is this T200 Fatima Pittsburgh card with Honus Wagner. I only notice a couple small creases, the most obvious is from the end of 'Nationals' along the bottom border towards the upper right corner. Image is sharp and slightly darker than posted image. \n\nPrice of $SOLD includes shipping. PM me to reserve or with questions. Payment via Paypal 'gift' preferred over check. Card will be securely packaged for shipping and insured via the USPS. Thanks....Matt",
