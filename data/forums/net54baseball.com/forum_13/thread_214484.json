      "post_content": "I have given up on the T205 \"master\" set and will now concentrate on completing only the \"basic\" set. Here is one of the tougher variations Hoblitzell name correct no Cin after 1908 in stats. Sorry for the bad scans, the printing on the back is clear but appears fuzzy in the scan.\n\nI would like to trade this for T205 cards I still need for my set and would especially be interested if you have an off condition Cy Young card.\nHere is my T205 wantlist:\n\nCady Dahlen (Graham cubs) Kleinow (Leifield initial A. on front) Pfeister Rucker (Shean Cubs) Sweeney Turner (Wilhelm \u201csuffe ed\u201d in 18th line of bio) Young\n\nI have two of the other variations also avail to trade:\n1. Hoblitzel name incorrect no Cin: SGC A\n2. Chase both ears show: I have both the \"frame ends at shoulders\" and \"frame extends below shoulders\" am willing to trade either one. Both are SGC 20.\n\nLarry\n\n[URL=http://s176.photobucket.com/user/larrytipton/media/Scan%20178.jpg.html][IMG]http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w185/larrytipton/Scan%20178.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s176.photobucket.com/user/larrytipton/media/Scan%20180.jpg.html][IMG]http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w185/larrytipton/Scan%20180.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
