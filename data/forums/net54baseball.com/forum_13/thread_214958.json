      "post_content": "Hi All,\n\nI am selling the below T210 series 3 Morris horizontal card. The card is in poor condition with damage from scrapbook removal on the reverse. The front of the card also exhibits wear but also a relatively faint wet-sheet transfer. Overall, the card is in poor condition but one of the more desirable and only horizontal card from the entire set. \n\n\nThis card is now sold.\n\n\nThank you,\n\nZach R1ce\n\n[URL=http://s102.photobucket.com/user/mzm55cards/media/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-06%20at%203.27.34%20PM_zps5adqkbc3.png.html][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-06%20at%203.27.34%20PM_zps5adqkbc3.png[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s102.photobucket.com/user/mzm55cards/media/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-06%20at%203.27.42%20PM_zps20dhni2l.png.html][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-06%20at%203.27.42%20PM_zps20dhni2l.png[/IMG][/URL]",
