      "post_content": "Pretty rare pack.   Nice compainion piece.  Still full with tobacco.  Due to the kind of stamp on there I am pretty sure the pack dates to 1926 - but still pretty close to period.   And I believe the packaging is the same from the era of the cards.   $300ppd.   Please PM if interested.   Thank you.   -peter",
