He was player/manager for the Montgomery Climbers.\n\nCondition is a little rough, but if you are reading this thread you probably know how difficult individual T211s are.  The price is $350 via secure shipping.  Incidentally, I also have his T210 available.\n\nPlease email me at [url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.  Thank you.\n\n[IMG]http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee76/seablaster/IMG_20151205_0031_zps5fqbxiir.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee76/seablaster/IMG_20151205_0032_zpsxebvzwar.jpg[/IMG]",
