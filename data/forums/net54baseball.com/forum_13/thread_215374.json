      "post_content": "I have a 1910-12 Plow Boy Tobacco Cabinet of Billy Purtell, Chicago White Sox for sale or trade. One very light crease, with just minor corner wear. The back has four small paper pull spots which affect none of the text. These are extremely difficult to find at all, let alone in presentable condition. The few recent examples auctioned have seen very spirited bidding.\n\nAsking $1,100 or will trade for one I need. \n\nI am seeking the following: Bodie, Cicotte, Davis, Howard, Jones, Miller, Olmstead, Scot(incorrect), Tannehill & White.\n\nI do have a few others that I would trade as well.",
