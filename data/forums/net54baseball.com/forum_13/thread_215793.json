These have great centering and have been cherished in my personal sets for years.  I need to raise some cash so time to move them out to other collectors that can appreciate the hunt for exceptional looking cards with striking color, contrast and clean backs.  My email is [url]ekekela08@aol.com[/url].  I prefer payment by check or MO.  \n\n[url]http://s135.photobucket.com/user/iakona8/slideshow/Graded%20cards%20for%20sale[/url]",
