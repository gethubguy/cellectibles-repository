They were issued as part of this set very late in its production (late 1911 probably).\n\nThere are A NUMBER of threads in the archives here that help to explain their scarcity (and other cards in this set) and it is worth your time to find and read them, if interested.\n\nI have collected this set for a number of years, but won't pretend to be anywhere near as knowledgeable as many of the folks who post here!\n\nEXCELLENT question - GOOD LUCK On your search...as long as you are NOT looking for the same cards that I am!!!  :D:D:D",
