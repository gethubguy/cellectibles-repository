      "post_content": "I collect T202 middle panels, and the following are some doubles I've accumulated.  These black and white photos represent some of the great photography of the era--I believe at least some were shot by the famous Conlin--Cobb's slide into third being iconic.\nAnd the text on the back is illustrative of the baseball jargon of that day.\nHow many other cards in that era have text like these do?\n\nIf you're a hall-of-fame collector on a tight budget, I believe that these are about the best you can do--\n\nCards range from Poor-VG+.  I've given individual prices, but I'm only going to sell these as a group/or in customized groups totaling $100 or more, at which point I'll ship for free.\n\na few sca\nTake all 35 cards for $300, delivered.\nStarter's set: 26 singles for $250, free S/H\nBest Nine H-o-F Cards featuring 10 hall-of-Famers: $104 delivered: \n\nEVERS Makes a Safe Slide, $12,\nCOLLINS Easily Safe, $11,\nBENDER Takes a Close One, [2], $12, $8,\nWHEAT Strikes Out [2], $12, $10,\nJust Before the Battle [McGRAW shaking hands w.

The paper is broken in the middle of Cobb's face [a pre-existing condition], but his stark profile still looks good.\nI tried to minimize the damage with the soaking, and I think I succeded.  It may be a beater but it's still a whole card, and an iconic Cobb.\n\nT213 Type 2 Baker, SGC 10, $70 + $3 S/H,--SOLD--",

      "post_content": "Thanks, Rick, for your interest and question.\nI've posted a scan, and it is --Phila. Amer.\n\nI'll also give you my opinion on the card though it devalues it:\n\nIt seems like there is some kind of thin \"veneer\" on the front of the card that slightly darkens it.  The best evidence of this is in the upper-right hand border where the veneer ends and there is a whiter contrast.  On the back, there are stains of some gluey-looking substance, which might well be the veneer on the front.\n\nStill, PSA gave it a 1, and it's not a bad-looking 1.\n\nSo, price of the card?\nI don't know the T 213 market at all, and I don't know if/how much my stated opinion would influence the price.  I'll check out Ebay's \"completed listings,\" but I'd ask you, if you don't mind, what you think would be a fair asking price for it.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug",
