I can also provide references from people I deal with. I would prefer Paypal goods because it protects everybody and I would much rather print my labels.\n\nIf the card doesn't sell, I will keep it.\n\nThanks again!\n\n[IMG][URL=http://s51.photobucket.com/user/castor_troy75/media/002_15.jpg.html][IMG]http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f353/castor_troy75/002_15.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n[URL=http://s51.photobucket.com/user/castor_troy75/media/001_26.jpg.html][IMG]http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f353/castor_troy75/001_26.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
