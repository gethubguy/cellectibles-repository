We had him over six years ago and I picked up a nice 34' Goudey to compliment his name!\n\nWe are expecting a new son and are looking at Christy Mathewson as his namesake.  Thus I am now looking for a Christy Mathewson card.  I would really like a nicely priced T3, but am open to other options.\n\nLet me know what you have!\n\nThanks!",
