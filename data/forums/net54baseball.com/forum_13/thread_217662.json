Full disclosure:  there is what I would consider a medium-heavy crease running from his left sleeve up through his shoulder up to the top border.  It shows in the scan, but one could miss it at a quick glance.\n\nIt also appears to be a partial 'name on top' as there's two faint blue marks at the top border.\n\nI'll take $old or trade for an SGC Brooklyn T206 that I need (Alperman, Bell (pitching), Bergen (batting), Hummel, Lennox, Lumley, Marshall, McIntyre (brooklyn)) or trade for any of the 3 Louisville T206s.",
