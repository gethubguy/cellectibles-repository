      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T200 Fatima cards for sale. All of these are clearly very low grade and have major condition issues.  Still, these are the most reasonably priced (by a long shot) period/tobacco cards you can find of Wagner, Mathewson, and Thorpe.  Despite the obvious damage on these cards, the areas picturing the key HOF'ers are spotless.\n\nPlease add $2 shipping for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Payment via any method you prefer. I'd also be glad to trade for any other cards I need from this set. Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\n\n**LOT IS SOLD**",
