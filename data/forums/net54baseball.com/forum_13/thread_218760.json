I am looking for my great great grandfathers T210 card. It is the 1910 series 3 #213 Hub Northen Houston Buffaloes card. My dad and I have been able to collect quite a few of the T207s but have never been able to get lucky on a t210. If anybody has a lead on one I would appreciate any and all advice. Also thru my original post someone said that they thought he was also in another obscure card set but couldn't remember for sure. Thru all of my research I had only been able to find evidence of him having just the t210 and t207 cards. If anyone has heard of another please shoot me some information on this. Sorry for the long winded post, appreciate all the help y'all have given me thus far!",

I dont have any duplicates and I know its not on eBay at the current moment. Hopefully another Red Border collector can steer you in the right direction. Good luck I will keep an eye out for you.",
