Whenever I need a fix, I'll bump it with the amount I want to spend in the title. I only have a few dozen so you can see from my need list that finding a hit will be like shooting fish in a barrel. I'm looking for fairly presentable cards in the VG range. No trimming, moderate or heavy creasing, heavily rounded corners, etc, though I'll take eye appeal over technical grade. Small amount of paper loss or writing on the back ok as long as I can still read the text. Back variations mean nothing to me, fyi. Out of courtesy to other threads, please use PM vs. posting/bumping here. I prefer raw, but will consider anything.
