      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T205 cards for sale or trade. These are mostly nicer mid-grade cards as the scans will show.  Even the lower grade cards in the group have nice eye appeal for the technical grade.  Only a few beaters in this lot! \n\nPlease add $2 shipping for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Payment via any method you prefer. Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\n\nCARDS PICTURED (removing **SOLD** cards for easier viewing):\n\nUngraded Cards:\n\nDygert - $20\nFlynn - $20\nMattern (card on left) - $18\nMattern (card on right) - $20\n\nGraded Cards:\n\nBarger (Partial \"B\") SGC 50 - $200",
