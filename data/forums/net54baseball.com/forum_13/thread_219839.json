Saw one at a local card show and was hooked back into collecting just like that.\n\nLooking for an SGC or PSA-graded example, ranging from 1.5 to a 4.  Eye appeal is important, but for the 1.5's and 2's, creasing is of course ok.  Paper loss and dark staining would probably be the only deal breakers.  Will pay a premium for a nice-for-grade example.  Method of payment is your choice.\n\nCard will be going to a fellow collector, with no chance of leaving my personal collection in the foreseeable future.",

I was worried I had lost out, as I only got back from vacation in S.C. around Midnight last night, but it's probably just a step below what I'm looking for.  Thanks though -- I had missed that one completely!  :D",
