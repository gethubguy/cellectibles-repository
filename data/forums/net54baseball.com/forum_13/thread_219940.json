      "post_content": "Hi Jason,\nIt looks like you have a nice T212 collection so I thought I'd check with you on this card. I enjoyed your slideshow. Al Bonner was my grandfather. I only have been able to find and purchase one of his cards, a 1910 T212 Obak. It has the Obak advertising on the back. This one has the player description. Anyway probably a shot in the dark but thought I'd check.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nTerry Pierce\nSeattle, WA.",
