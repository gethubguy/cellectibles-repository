      "post_content": "I'm on a journey starting today to track down a card of each player who was managed my Carl Molesworth between 1923 and 1925. The hard work has been completed as I know what cards I need plus, thanks to a fellow member, a T211 and T201-8 of Molesworth is set to arrive any day. (These cards are what is driving this search.)\n\nI already have an E103 McQuillan now I only need the 16 other players :eek:. \nBelow is my list:\n\nAl Demaree - T222 Fatima Player Cards\nDoug Baird - M101-6 Felix Mendlesohn\nDuke Kenworthy - 1924 Walter Mails Card Game\nGrover Hartley - T207 Brown Background\nHick (Forrest) Cady - T205 Gold Border\nIke Davis - 1928 Zeenut\nMandy Brooks - 1927 M.L.
