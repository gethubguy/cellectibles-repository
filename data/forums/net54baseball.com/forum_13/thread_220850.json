      "post_content": "The McConnell SGC 20 looks like a \"50\" on the front...no wear or wrinkling and in very nice shape.  He does have some pencil tracings/markings on the back.  Lord has a small tear along his jawline that is tough to pick up in the scan.  On the whole, it's a pretty displayable example as well though he would technically be in poor-fair condition.\n\nStill, you don't see the Boston players come up too often so here's a good shot at a couple of them!\n\nMcConnell sold....Lord now $45...\n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]",
