(roughly 100 of them) As you can see by the reverse it has some rather interesting marks. This was the last card at the bottom of the stack located in one of the many tobacco tins that all of these cards had been stored in since they were produced 100+ years ago. The rust from the tin transposed onto the card what I would call a tattoo per say. Kinda cool if you ask me!!\n\nSee pics below. Please let me know via PM or email if interested. And yes, the tobacco tin mentioned/shown will accompany the card. I think they're linked for life.\n\nThanks all,\n\nTony\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/t204reillyfront.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/t204tomreillyback_1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/photo.JPG[/IMG]\n\nPicture using software to overlay the cards back image into the tin showing how it would have rested for a perfect match.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/overlay.jpg[/IMG]",
