I wanted to see scans of Ford, white cap, Kirby White, and the minor leaguer ?Hanford?].\n\nAre you still interested?\n\nEmail [url]djdoremus@msn.com[/url].  I can't take the pm's as my pm box constantly gets full, and the format is poor for extended correspondence.  Besides, if scans are involved it has to be email.\n\nThanks.\n\nDoug",
