      "post_content": "From the REA listing\nGraded EX 60 by SGC. Extremely rare sample card from one of the T100 \"Silhouettes\" set. Issued in 1910 by the Honest Tobacco Company, this set features silhouette images of various characters and professions (bartender, plumber, fireman, fisherman, policeman, waiter, etc.). Among the fifty cards in the set, five cards feature sports figures (baseball, football, boxing, golf, and bowling). The card measures 2.25 x 3.25 inches and pictures a catcher facing left waiting to catch the ball. While the player is not identified, the catcher has the Giants' \"NY\" insignia on his shoulder, which could allow for a theoretical identification as Bresnahan. We have seen non-sport examples from this set, but this is the first example of the baseball player in the set we have ever encountered. This is certainly a very unusual and interesting sample card rarity. Excellent condition. \n\n$1000/BO\n\n[IMG]http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j46/teddytouch7239/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/signed52s012_zpsqfuuefg8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j46/teddytouch7239/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/signed52s013_zps6olbgd9v.jpg[/IMG]",
