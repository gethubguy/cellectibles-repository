They are all in very nice condition, no stains or rust, as shown.  There is one large letter Speaker, that has a very interesting red lettered paper back.  It seems that PSA does not differentiate the backs when grading them.  What do you think of the rarity of these?  I can't find much information, just that they are rarer than the normal backs.  Also, what do you think of the value of these?  I'll probably be looking to sell the lot.  The attached are the highest end of the lot.  Thanks as always for the help.  I love this forum!\n\nDave\n[IMG][URL=http://s747.photobucket.com/user/stoogeco/media/IMG_1752.jpg.html][IMG]http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx112/stoogeco/IMG_1752.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n[IMG][URL=http://s747.photobucket.com/user/stoogeco/media/IMG_1754.jpg.html][IMG]http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx112/stoogeco/IMG_1754.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]",

The large letters don't get quite as much respect as they once did and overall the pins aren't as popular as they once were.  There are some of the 'commons' that are very tough to find too.  Non large letters, that is............congrats on the pickup.",

      "post_content": "Nice P2's! I think this particular raw grouping would be worth between $500-600. My small experience has shown that these pins (HOF'ers) sell faster than you might think. I believe certain condition factors and variations really DO make them that much more attractive and sell quicker. Your pins show some of these attributes - large letters, red backs, centered backs, rust-free. One thing for sure, nice pickup!",
