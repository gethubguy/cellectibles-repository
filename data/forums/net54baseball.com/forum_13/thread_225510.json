Old Cardboard apparently does not have any more, and I'm looking to pick up a few as gifts.\n\nFor reference, this is what I'm looking for:\n[url]https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Baseball-Cards-Volumes-Combined/dp/B003U8ZHNE[/url]\n\nIf you have any new or gently used copies, please let me know.  I'm looking to pay $35 delivered for new/like new copies (which is what Old Cardboard previously sold them for).  I pay with paypal f/f.\n\nThanks,\nSteve",
