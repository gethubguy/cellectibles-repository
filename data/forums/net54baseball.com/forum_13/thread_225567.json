      "post_content": "Raw or graded, doesn't matter.  I am looking for cards with very good eye appeal, but not necessarily a high grade.  Pinholes are okay, rounded corners and minor creasing also okay.  The cards I want will have little to no staining and good focus.  Fronts would have no paper loss, but minor paper loss on back would be fine.  Definitely no writing on front.  \n\nThe cards I need are Brown, Kleinow, McGraw, Baker, Bell, Carrigan and Wallace.\n\n\n[url]drumback2@gmail.com[/url]",
