      "post_content": "I have been a Cardinals team set collector for years and since finding net54 have turned my interests more toward pre-war cards. Like many here, I just love the T206 set and have finally finished one of each Cardinal player, except of course the O'Hara, which I cannot afford. I will eventually try for as many different backs as I can, but I have just become interested in the T213 Coupon Cigarette cards because they use some of the same pictures as the T206 set but with different team designations. \nI just picked up a Jack Warhop, St. Louis Nat. card and found out that he only played for the Yankees and never even played for the Cardinals. (Thanks, Adam)\nI have also seen Owen Wilson in his Pittsburgh uniform like on the T206 card and has him as a Cardinal also, and both the Miller Huggins cards that list him as a Cardinal in his Cincinnati uniform.\nIf anyone has any T213 Coupon Cigarette Cardinals cards for sale I would be interested, if not too expensive. \nThanks - Eric",
