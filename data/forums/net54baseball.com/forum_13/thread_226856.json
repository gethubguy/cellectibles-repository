      "post_content": "Purchased this from COMC recently with plans to grade it, but to be honest, I'd rather not wait for the turnaround time to get it back if I don't have to. So with that said, I'm offering it for $50.00 less than I planned to initially with it being graded.\n\nAsking $400.00 via PPFF for this Cobb T213-2 Coupon (Bat variation) card. Obviously, it's in lower grade condition with some light creasing and several scratches on the front. The back has major paper loss.  Guaranteed to be authentic.\n\nNice lower grade (okay, beater) Cobb that is all in one piece for someone looking to buy one for a personal collection or set.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any specific questions if images are not good enough.",
