I don\u2019t think that ANY of the cards are trimmed, but please check out the scans and use your own judgement.  I would be happy to answer your questions or provide additional scans if you want them.\n\nKNIGHT (Honest Long Cut) \u2013 $15.00 - SOLD\nOLDRING \u2013 $15.00 - SOLD \nSNODGRASS \u2013 [STRIKE]$15.00[/STRIKE] - SOLD\nTANNEHILL \u2013 $15.00 - SOLD\nWILSON \u2013 [STRIKE]$15.00[/STRIKE] - SOLD\n\n\nAUSTIN \u2013 [STRIKE]$40[/STRIKE], GREAT-LOOKING card, a little bit of paper loss on reverse. - SOLD\nBRESNAHAN (Closed) \u2013 [STRIKE]$45[/STRIKE], tack hole - SOLD!\nGIBSON \u2013 [STRIKE]$28[/STRIKE] SOLD!\nLOBERT \u2013 [STRIKE]$32[/STRIKE] SOLD!\nMcGRAW \u2013 [STRIKE]$50[/STRIKE] - SOLD!\nNEEDHAM \u2013 \u201cFlame-Kissed\u201d \u2013 [STRIKE]$25[/STRIKE] \u2013 SAD, as this card would have been REALLY nice, crease-free. - SOLD!\nPHILLIPPE (Hassan 649) \u2013 [STRIKE]$45[/STRIKE] a little bit of paper loss on reverse. - [STRIKE]$35[/STRIKE]  SOLD\n\nPlease message me if you are interested.
