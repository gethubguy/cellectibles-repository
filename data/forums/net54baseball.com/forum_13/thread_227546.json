      "post_content": "Guys..............For sale is this original Recruit Cigars box that may have once housed a t207 baseball card, but is now stuffed with some newspaper clippings. The box/pack is in FAIR condition with some nice graphics and good color. The remnants of the tax stamp don't reveal any year markings. Price of $35 includes careful packing + shipping. PM with questions. Thanks..........Matt",
