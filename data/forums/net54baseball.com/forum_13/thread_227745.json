Super color and eye appeal on this one.\n\nThere are a couple small very faint creases on the bottom border that are hard to see, but mentioned for 100% accuracy.\n\nIf you like Mr. Collins, please drop me an email. \n\nThanks all, Tony\n\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/large/t3ecollinsfront_NEW.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/large/t3ecollinsback.jpg[/IMG]",
