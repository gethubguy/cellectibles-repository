      "post_content": "I have the following series 8s for sale (or for trade for T211s). All prices are OBO. Any \"I'll take it\" trumps ongoing negotiations. First link under each listing is to a front scan, while the second is to a back scan. Three of these don't have any VCP data in any grade, so I'm just open to offers on those without a specific asking price. \n\nAll these came from an original collection of T210s and T211s in west Tennessee. There were about 200 cards total. These are the series 8s that don't have T211 pairs that were in the collection. The rest are not for sale at this time. \n\nFull disclosure - All these were in a scrapbook.  The scrapbook sheets were all cut apart by the family. All the cards have been soaked in an effort to remove the paper. Some of the cards, which appeared on only be affixed to one piece of paper came off smoothly (only Phillips came clean in this grouping) and many of them seemed to have been pasted in a previous scrapbook, cut out, and re-pasted in another book; these did not come clean, resulting in the back condition you see.\n\n(also, I know the pop reports aren't super accurate here, but I did put the total population SGC+PSA for a few of the cards)\n\nNewton SGC Authentic Birmingham No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd3.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLarsen SGC Authentic Birmingham Pop 4 No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd4.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd4.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEmery SGC Authentic Birmingham No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd7.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd7.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWagner SGC 10/1 Poor Birmingham No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd8.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMcTigue SGC Authentic Birmingham No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd9.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd9.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMcGilvray SGC Authentic Birmingham Pop 3 No prior sales - No longer for sale\n[IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/fd10.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://burlssports.com/wp-content/uploads/bd10.jpg[/IMG]",
