      "post_content": "I hate to sell these off, but I need the funds for something else.  Shown is my small Gilliam Squires collection of 13 T212 cards.  These range from Good to VG-EX.  A couple were graded SGC 50 but I broke them out.  I'd really like to keep these together and sell to someone who has interest in pursuing more of them.  Here's a nice chance to get a bunch at once.  I'm asking [STRIKE]$600.00[/STRIKE] $[STRIKE]550.00[/STRIKE] $450.00 OBO for them.  Paypal preferred.  I will ship Priority with insurance.  \n\n[URL=http://s606.photobucket.com/user/jalbregts/media/IMG_0001%203_zpsrribypme.jpg.html][IMG]http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt148/jalbregts/IMG_0001%203_zpsrribypme.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s606.photobucket.com/user/jalbregts/media/IMG_0002%202_zpsy5h85n5i.jpg.html][IMG]http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt148/jalbregts/IMG_0002%202_zpsy5h85n5i.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
