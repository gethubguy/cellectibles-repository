      "post_content": "I'm still hunting for a nice Paddy Livingston T207 (A on shirt version.)\n\nNo fewer than 5 have shown up on eBay this past month, but all of the examples have had creases, wrinkles, and paper loss on the front.\n\nI'm looking for a creaseless, clean front example. Will pay strong for one that matches my other 2 Paddy Livingston T207s. I have both big and small \"C\" examples in EX condition.\n\nThanks,\n\nPatrick",
