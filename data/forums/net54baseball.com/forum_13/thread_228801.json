      "post_content": "Good luck with this. Grover Hartley managed the minor league team my uncle (1939) and grandpa (1940) played on. I was on a wild goose chase for this card for a LONG time. His cards are rare, and anything in decent condition fetches a couple hundred dollars at minimum. I got mine at the National this year, and it was the only one there I believe. There is a tiny bit of paper loss on the back, and obviously the crease down the middle. I paid around $140 for this, and will look to add a nicer condition one eventually. \n\n[IMG]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CpDrssvVUAAr79N.jpg[/IMG]",
