      "post_content": "Good evening everyone. I am from Winchester Ky and to clear up some confusion on the board my former id tag was TT40391.  I left the board for a while and got out of collecting but I am back in now trying to complete a winchester hustlers team set.  I currently have four of the 12 different players in the checklist.  I have:\nReed\nGoosetree (hands behind back)\nAtwell\nColeman\nI need any card not listed above.  If anyone has any for sale please message through the board or at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \nThanks as always for all your help\n\nWilliam",
