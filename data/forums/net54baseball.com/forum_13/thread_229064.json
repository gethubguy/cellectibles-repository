      "post_content": "Bump for a one-time big drop. Didn't want to go this low on it but looking for some extra holiday cash and I got a good deal on it. Card has been slabbed by SGC and graded Authentic.\n\nThis is a Ty Cobb T213-2 Coupon card bat off variation. Obviously rarer than the T206.\n\nClearly a low grade card here with the biggest flaw being the major paper loss on the back. If you have any other specific questions relating to the condition, please let me know. Nice affordable copy of a fairly rare Cobb card.\n\n[STRIKE]$425[/STRIKE] Drop to [STRIKE]$400[/STRIKE] shipped $325 via PPFF (add 3% for regular PP)",
