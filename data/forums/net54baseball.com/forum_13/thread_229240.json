Then came the upgrades.\n\nI don't feel Series 1 gets the \"toughness\" label it should, imo.:rolleyes:\n\nNice clean raw set.  Only a few creases, and backs are clean with only a few flecks.\n\nThis lot will not be split up (Mr. Viola, Manion, Lipe, Martina, etc. will stay with their teammates).\n\n$7,000\n\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThanks, Scott\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246599&d=1475103800[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246600&d=1475103817[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246601&d=1475103826[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246602&d=1475103835[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246603&d=1475103845[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246604&d=1475103853[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246605&d=1475103862[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246606&d=1475103871[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246607&d=1475103881[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246608&d=1475103890[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246609&d=1475103898[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=246610&d=1475103907[/IMG]",
