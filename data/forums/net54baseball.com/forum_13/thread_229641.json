Asking $225 delivered or perhaps t204s, 1915 CJs, 1918 Zeenuts, e97 B&Ws, any oddities/printing goofs or neat type cards in trade....thanks in advance!\n\n***SOLD!!***\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=247578&d=1475948573[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=247580&d=1475948587[/IMG]",
