      "post_content": "I have been listing some stuff recently.  I wanted to state, though, that I am done with the hobby.  If you are a Christian you may understand where I am coming from, but I have been feeling convicted about this hobby becoming my \"god\".  For this reason I am going to attempt to sell it all so I can refocus my priorities.  \n\nIf you have seen me post something that you would like for your collection please reach out to me.  This includes anything from my Lobert back run to my t205 American Beauty Subset and anything in between.  I also do have somethings listed on ebay that I will take fair offers on (more loose than I was in the past, so if you made an offer that I rejected or countered I suggest trying again).\n\nI will be looking into consignments, but wanted to give the site first crack.  \n\nLobert Run - Already sold the e90-1 and d303 duplicates shown prior to coming to this decision.\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k607/bn2cardz/PreWar/LOBERT%20E92%20IMAGE%20RUN/LOBERT%20RUN_zpsufbfqsf4.jpg[/IMG]\n\nt205 American Beauty subset (this only shows a single copy of each, but I do have multiple copies of some)\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k607/bn2cardz/PreWar/T-Series/T205ABCollection_zpswg5mu6uy.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI am specifically mentioning these two sub collections because these are the ones that I have most prized, if I can sell from these the rest will be very easy (ripping off the band-aid).  Yet if you know of something else in my collection feel free to reach out to me.\n\nI can be contacted at [url]bn2cardz@gmail.com[/url].",

Most of the t205 AB set is gone, the buyer only needed to add to their set so I still have some and I will reply to all that were interested after I have all the ones bought from those left.\n\nFor those asking for a list of cards.  I wasn't the most organized when it wasn't part of one of my main two interests so I will have to compile a list with photos of what I have.  I just had to get the ball rolling or else I would never do it.",
