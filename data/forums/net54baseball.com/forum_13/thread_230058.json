      "post_content": "For sale is a very tough T210-5 Ivy Wingo. Wingo later went on to become a big leaguer and World Series Champion by beating the Black Sox in the 1919 World Series. This example is one of the better conditioned that I have seen and with tougher T210's rising in value, this is a great card to have. $600 delivered.
