Under magnification, you can see a single tiny dot to the right of the \"c\" but there are several dots of the typical Polar Bear tobacco staining in that area also, so it's very difficult to tell whether it is the faint remnant of a print dot or some other type of staining.  Either way, it's extremely difficult to see with the naked eye.  Thanks for the interest!",
