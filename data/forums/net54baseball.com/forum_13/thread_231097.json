      "post_content": "Hello,\nDirectly from my recent mini-find of 33 Turkey Reds. These cards have lived in Virginia for the last 100+ years and were passed down through the family of the original owner. \n\nThis Cobb presents extremely well. The color, clarity and focus are perfect, the back is clean and the corners fine.  It's only issue is some light creasing/rippling in the lower right corner.  It hasn't been sent for grading.  I've had several hundred T3s graded by PSA and think this card has a chance at a 4. I can't guarantee that of course.  \n\nIf you have an interest in the card, please send me an email address I'll send a few more nice high resolution shots for you to review.  [url]Craigdiamondt3@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nThe card is for sale. Let's start the discussion at $7500.  \n\nThank you,\nCraig",
