      "post_content": "For sale is a T205 card of Christy Mathewson.  Card is clean as shown with a slight diamond cut and the reverse clean and bright. On the reverse, directly above the \"r\" in Christopher and outside the red border there's a \"line\" in the picture. It's an indent that you can feel and it causes a raised portion on the front in the border that you can also fee.  Looking at the back the upper left corner is slightly bumped.  Prices include shipping. PayPal Friends / Family or mailed payment accepted. Please reserve at [url]old-baseball@sbcglobal.net[/url]. \n\n\n\nThanks! Kevin\n\nChristy Mathewson - \n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=648&pictureid=21697[/IMG]",
