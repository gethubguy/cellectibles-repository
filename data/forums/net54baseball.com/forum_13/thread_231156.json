      "post_content": "Hello,\n\n******NOTE:  Since this thread received an unexpected bump today (3/6/17), I thought it would be good to note that I have a fully updated list of 45 T3s available for sale - graded, ungraded, rarities and even a Cobb.  Send me an email and I'll send you the list. Thank you. \n\nListed below are most of the cards from my recent mini-find of Turkey Reds. (Cobb has its own thread). These cards are new to the hobby, originated in Virginia and were purchased from the grandson of the original owner.  They're all raw and so where I've noted grading, it's my estimate of what I think PSA might say. I obviously can't guarantee a grade, it's just my estimate.  These cards sat stacked and stashed away for many decades. They're not altered in any way, most just suffering from light and honest wear.  If you have an interest in any of these, please send me an email (craigdiamondt3@yahoo.com) and I'll send photos for your review. Thanks for looking, hope you find something you like.  These are great cards. \n\nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO MAKE ME AN OFFER.  HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. \n\nHere goes. \n\n4. Bresnahan - 2 $275, no crease, chips on front. \n5.
