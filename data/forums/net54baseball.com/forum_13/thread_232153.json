      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nFor many years I've been collecting a Turkey Red subset, specific to a back variation found in the first series (1-50) cards.  I've always referred to it as a \"No-Ad\" back and SGC refers to it on their labels as a \"No Offer\" back.\n\nAn example of the Cobb \"No-Ad\" is shown below.\n\nI'm currently still searching for the following:  Dahlen, Donovan, Jennings, Joss and McIntyre (Det).  If you have any of these, I'm an interested buyer.\n\nIf you have any others, I'd potentially be interested in those as well as upgrades are always welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for taking a look at your cards to see if you have any Turkey Reds with this back variation.\n\nHappy Collecting,\nCraig",
