Downgraded by Sgc due to some rust staining on the reverse caused by the tobacco tin that it was stored in for many years. Card originates from of a large Ramly find I had a couple years back.\n\nTobacco tin mentioned above is included and will ship with the card. Why break em up now, right? :) See pics below!\n\n(SOLD)  - Please drop me an email if interested. \n\nThanks all,\n\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/t204reillyfront.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/t204tomreillyback_1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/photo.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/websize/oxfordtin.JPG[/IMG]",
