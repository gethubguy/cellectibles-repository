      "post_content": "Hey y'all, thinking I might treat myself to a little Christmas present and pick up a T210-8 card of a Memphis player (depending on price, of course hah).  Just want to see what all is out there.  Prefer slabbed, but if you have a decent rep in selling raw T cards then I could be persuaded to go slab-less.  Low, low grade copies are all the budget will allow.  Authentic is fine as well.  Not picky at all on the player.\n\nIf you have anything you think I'd be interested in, just shoot me a PM on here.  Also would be interested in other pre-war cards/issues of Memphis teams, so feel free to hit me up as well if you've got anything that fits that bill.\n\nHope everyone is doing well and staying warm!",
