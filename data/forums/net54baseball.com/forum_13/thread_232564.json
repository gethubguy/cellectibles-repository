I paid $15 for Downey, so I would like to sell it for SOLD, thank you.\n\nThe interesting thing is that you can see Zimmerman at the top of the card.\n\nAny type of payment is fine, or I would love to trade for a low grade beater T213-2 or Weil Baking even if I have to throw in a few bucks to even up the trade.\n\nThanks, Rick",
