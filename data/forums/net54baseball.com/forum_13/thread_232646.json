      "post_content": "For sale are a couple different 't' cards. Prices include shipping...\n\nt222 Slim Sallee.....1914 T222 Fatima Slim Sallee, graded SGC 20. The card has a couple creases and a small chip missing from the upper left corner. The image is clear.......$SOLD\n\nt207 Edward Cicotte w/ the scarce Napoleon back, there are two very small holes along the top border from a staple long ago. If not for these holes, I would grade the card VG-EX+ due to a couple very light creases with the more noticeable one starting at Cicotte's flaired collar and traveling down to the 'N' in 'Boston'. This is only noticeable to me when the card is tilted to the side and it shows up on the glossy surface. This card has nice color and a great image....$SOLD\n\nPlease PM me to purchase or with questions. Paypal 'gift/friends' preferred.\n\nThanks for looking..........Matt",
