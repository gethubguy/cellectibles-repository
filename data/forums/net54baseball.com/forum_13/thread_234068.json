      "post_content": "Nice 1911 Obak card.  Graded VG by SGC; I will add a scan that shows the flip here later tonight.  Does not have any stamping or back damage like many Obaks you see in this grade or lower.  A light crease is visible on the back only. Wonderful bright color.  Asking $60 delivered - PayPal only.  Thanks!\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170118/96b86f35bb21d2bf9aa8eb81198fb02f.jpg[/IMG]\n-John\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",

It's a nice card, and I really don't want to let it go for less than $50 cash which is about what I have in it.  If not I will just keep it.\n\nThanks.",
