      "post_content": "I'm going to start selling this as a lot, which I think I have fairly priced.  If it does not sell as a lot by Monday, I will sell cards individually.  Lot includes the 13 cards shown for 400 dollars delivered.  Included in one of the tougher Hoblitzell versions, Hoffman with a green stripe, Chase border extends and a number of tough cards in the set.  Condition is about f/p, but with good eye appeal.",
