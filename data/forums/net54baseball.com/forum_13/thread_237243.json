I bought a Johnson B18 last year for $60 or so and it didn't have the coloring issues this one has. Not saying that someone wouldn't pay $50 or more but I don't think your offer is insulting. Nonetheless, getting any WaJo item under $100 is a steal in my book!",

It's definitely nice to see a transaction go down like this :)",
