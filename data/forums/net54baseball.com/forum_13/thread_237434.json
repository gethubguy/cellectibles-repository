      "post_content": "Hey all, I'm selling my T202 Lord Catches His Man, graded PSA 2 (good). Asking price is $240 + $10 shipping Paypal friends and family. If you prefer to pay via goods, that's fine, you'd just need to cover the fee difference. The card will be boxed priority mail and shipped with insurance. Note: this card has been sold!\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/vomXA2G.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is, of course, the much-discussed card featuring Shoeless Joe Jackson in the center panel. The card, in my opinion, presents strongly for the low grade. There are two flaws, I see, in the center panel where Jackson is out at third-one, a small (1.5 cm) vertical crease running from the bottom border to Jackson's extended leg. There is a second small crease in Lord's right leg.\n\nHere are larger scans of the front and back:\n\n[URL=\"http://i.imgur.com/0enP4mq.jpg\"]Front of the card[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://i.imgur.com/gyPfC3u.jpg\"]Back of the card[/URL]\n\nIf you have questions, or need additional pictures, please let me know. I can take with my iPhone 7 if you prefer angled shots of the surface.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nBill",
