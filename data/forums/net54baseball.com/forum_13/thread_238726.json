      "post_content": "Ok guys, since I have absolutely no experience with back rarity on t205's, I am going to rely on the honor system here. I have 1 T205 available that came in a collection of 50's-70's cards. It's a George Gibson that looks to be in excellent condition (about a PSA 4 in my assumption). Scans are attached below. I don't know if this is a $50 card or a $500 card or somewhere in between. If someone wants to give me a ballpark figure on what to ask publicly I would appreciate it or I can just accept an offer that sounds reasonable. Please just be fair and honest as I'm sure some will chime in with lowball offers and some will be respectable.\nThanks for looking and good luck!\nTony\n\nNOW SOLD - THANKS MICHAEL!",

It came in a lot of cards, but the price was paid for that card.  After selling the rest of I may have come back to a $200 card in lower condition.\n\nWhile others have been distracted with t206 cards, t205 enthusiats have brough to light the rarity information for some of these.  Another very tough AB card is the Mathewson.",
