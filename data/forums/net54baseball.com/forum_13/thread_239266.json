SGC 10.\n$250\n\nNot the best scans I know, but basically Campbell looks solid for the grade while Sweeney is a typical SGC 10 (if there is such a thing).\n\nI have eclectic interests on the trading front, but generally I'm interested in Louisiana issues, D issues, tough rookie cards, and rare backs. And hesitant to trade for anything more common than what I'm trading.",
