      "post_content": "Hi folks, I have 3 T213-2's for sale.  Prices include shipping.  Any type of payment is fine.  Thanks, Rick\n\nMiller, St. Louis Nat -  Stunning card.  Looks like it is fresh out of a pack of Coupon Cigarettes!  If it were not for the top right corner being bitten off by an alligator, this would be absolutely perfect. \n\nOnly $27 shipped.   Miller is SOLD - thank you.\n\nOldring, Philadelphia Amer.  -  This flawless piece of history can be yours for only\n\n$27  shipped.\n\nPaskert, Philadelphia Nat.  -  Another prime example of a card that is much nicer than it's grade.  Also included is an extra piece of vintage paper that is glued to the back of the card.  The only flaw is minor paper loss on the back.\n\nAdd this gem to your collection for only $22 OBO  shipped.",
