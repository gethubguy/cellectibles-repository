I would really like to avoid paper loss, but a small spot on the back might be ok.  Back stamps are fine, writing is not.\n\nThe prices on ebay are just a bit high. Let me know what you have.  You can send front and back scans and prices to [url]rchilders1973@gmail.com[/url]. Thanks! \n\nSent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk",

Would love to have some I could put  in tobacco sized toploaders in pages in a binder.   No major creasing, writing, or back damage.\n\nSent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk",

If I can get enough ungraded ones that I can live with, that's my plan.  I honestly think I would prefer that.\n\nSent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk",
