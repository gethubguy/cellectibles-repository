      "post_content": "I have been focusing on Obaks for a while, but I also really like the T205s. I own a couple but would like to get more of them, starting with a Brooklyn team set.  I am looking for cards in the VG-VGEX range.  They have to be well centered and not have a lot of chipping on the borders and no major creasing.  At this point, I am not looking to break the bank, but I do want to pick up a few to start.  Email at [url]rchilders1973@gmail.com[/url] with scans and prices of what you have.\n\n  I really want to try and do this without buying any slabs.  I plan on putting these in tobacco card sized toploaders and into tobacco card sized pages and into a binder.  They look so awesome like that!\n\nSent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk",
