I've been addicted to the Cubs since the outfield was patrolled by Cardenal, Monday, and Morales.  Steve Swisher was a god to a Little League catcher.  I also played SS, but that that Mick Kelleher, Davey Rosello platoon was hard to swallow.\n\nTake Care,\nGeno",

Know many of the retired Cubs from my 5 years of Cubs camp including Cardenal.  Jose is funny and has some great stories.  He is also good friends with Eddie Vedder of pearl Jam fame.  I have all the Sovereign Cubs except Archer.  There are 152 possible card front back combos for T205 Cubs of which I have 137 so looking for 15 cards.  Also looking for T 207 Napoleon backed Cubs.  Have my work cut out for me.\n\nBest in cardboard,\n\nKen",
