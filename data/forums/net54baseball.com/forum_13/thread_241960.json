Prices include shipping and preferred payment method is paypal f&f. The T205's were recently picked up on BST as a lot and I'm selling a few of the cards that I already had. I'm not the greatest at guessing grades but I've included what I believe there condition is. Please judge for yourself though. Let me know if you have any questions. \n\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/74275593@N05/sets/72157682994380863[/url]\n\n\nT201 Walter Johnson    PSA 4    [STRIKE]$350[/STRIKE] $325\nT201 Christy Mathewson    SGC 10 (1)    [STRIKE]$125[/STRIKE] $110\nT205 Christy Mathewson    Raw (P-F)    [STRIKE]$175[/STRIKE] $165\nT205 Eddie Collins (mouth closed)    (Gd)    [STRIKE]$70[/STRIKE] $65\nT205 Frank Baker    (Gd+)    [STRIKE]$80[/STRIKE] $75 SOLD\nT207 Walter Johnson    PSA 2    [STRIKE]$300[/STRIKE] [STRIKE]$28[STRIKE][/STRIKE]0[/STRIKE] SOLD\nT207 Charles Herzog (Anonymous Back Factory 25)    SGC 35 (2.5)    [STRIKE]$225[/STRIKE] $200\nT207 Tommy Leach (Anonymous Back Factory 3)    SGC 20 (1.5)    [STRIKE]$80[/STRIKE] $70",
