      "post_content": "Hello, Sorry if this is the wrong section to post this.  I'm wondering if anyone has had any issues recently with SGC cases cracking.  I had 10 cards graded back in the spring and 2 of them have developed cracks at the bottom of the case.  I called SGC and they said they've never heard of such a problem.  The cards were definitely not dropped.  Anyone else experienced this?  Thanks",
