      "post_content": "For sale is a 156 button lot of P2 pins from Sweet Caporal.  A spreadsheet listing each button can be provided for someone to finish the set.  The set includes 28 hall of Famers (including Cobb and Young small letters).  I'm consolidating my collection into T205's T206's. I would consider a FT or partial trade deal for specific cards from those sets.  \n\nSelling for $3,500 ($22) per button.  An REA auction in April sold a similar set (180 Buttons) for $28 per button in April.",
