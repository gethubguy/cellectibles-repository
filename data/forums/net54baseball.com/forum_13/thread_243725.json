      "post_content": "Looking to replace my T205 Cobby. I am looking for a well centered one with very little chipping. The lower the grade the better with those key attributes. I am willing to pay cash or trade my Joseph Hall cabinet in the deal. Or anything on my personal site, in my collection, besides the E90-1 Young or any hobby periodicals or postcards :). LOL This same request is going in the R section as I am looking for another R319 Goudey Ruth batting to replace the one I sold. Obviously there is only one Jos Hall cabinet (or anything else on my site) so any deal is subject to prior sale or trade. thanks...\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/phunc1888joshall.jpg[/IMG]",
