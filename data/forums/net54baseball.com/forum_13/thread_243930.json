      "post_content": "I love using one-touch holders for my standard-size cards, and decided to put my entire E-card collection into one-touches also.  Well, I had a brain fart and forgot that E90+ series cards are slightly larger than T cards, so now I have 60 brand new holders that I can't use.  All of them are unopened in the original plastic except for one, which I opened and realized was the wrong size for me.  [URL=\"http://www.ultrapro.com/product_info.php?products_id=4089\"]Here is the description on the Ultra Pro website.[/URL]  The MSRP on them is $1.99 each.  I found the cheapest possible deal on eBay and got them for about $1.50 each, plus $12.30 shipping, for a total of $102.09.  I'll sell them here for a flat $100 shipped.  Guaranteed you can't get them anywhere else cheaper than this.  Thanks!\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/Bliggity/forum-image-hosting/53411/ultrapro[/IMG]",
