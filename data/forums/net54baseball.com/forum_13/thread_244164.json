Dillon has a minor color pass shift that extends into the caption at the bottom of the card.  It also has an interesting sort of \"diamond cut\".  Dillon is in GD/VG condition with one tiny wrinkle on the right.  Asking $35....\n\nWould do both cards for $100 if anyone wanted both....\n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=285542&d=1503764773[/IMG]",
