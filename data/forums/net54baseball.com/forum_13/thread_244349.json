      "post_content": "I'm looking to sell my T207 Recruit fac. 606 Wallace ($25) and 1913 Napoleon Lajoie Game Card ($25). I accept  PayPal, check or MO   for   these.  Prices are net to me, so please add 3%  for regular   PayPal.  Domestic shipping is $3.50 per order and of course I will combine shipping.  Shipping to other countries, I will work  with you on price.  I'm sure this is the wrong place for the Lajoie, but no section says it is for game cards, so I figured I would combine it with the T207.\n\nScans available on  request.\n\nPM, or e-mail with questions or offers ( [URL=\"skeltone@rocketmail.com\"]skeltone@rocketmail.com[/URL]  ). A firm \"I'll take it\" will out do ongoing  negotiations.  Thanks for looking.\n\nMake an offer, you never know!",
