Very tough to find printer's scrap from non t206 sets and I can't imagine too many of these exist for t216.\n\nDon't have a dollar amount in mind to sell the card for but thought I'd at least offer it up for other cards I could use -\n\nt204 HOFers\n1918 Zeenuts\ne97 B&Ws\ne98 Chase (red)\n\nCash offers accepted too.  \n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=286335&d=1504372083[/IMG]",
