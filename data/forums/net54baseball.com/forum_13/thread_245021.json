      "post_content": "Morning everyone,\n\nMy T205 Gibson back run is missing Sweet Caporal, Polar Bear and American Beauty backs. I'm sure the AB back is a long shot, but what are the chances somebody has a decent PB or SC backed Gibson for sale?\n\nDoesn't matter if it's raw or graded. Looking for something mid-grade. I don't mind some wear, no holes, and prefer no paper loss, but if it's subtle, I don't mind.\n\nPost in the thread or PM me, please.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nRichard.",
