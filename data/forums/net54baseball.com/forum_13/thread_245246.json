      "post_content": "Title says it all. Looking for very well centered cards with little to no corner/border chipping. Creases are ok as long as they don't detract from the overall look. Willing to pay strong or weak, whichever is preferred.\n\nAddendum- Also looking for the other 140'ish for the set being worked on. If you have cards for sale, that look like these but not above a technical 6, I am interested. The lower technical grade the better....but no, or only very minor, paper loss on back. Slight wrinkles are perfect!! Like these would be great, which are the last ones added.....\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/t205master2.jpg[/IMG]",
