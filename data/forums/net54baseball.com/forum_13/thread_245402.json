      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have a 1910 T205 Davy Jones for sale. The price is now lowered to $25 (PayPal friends and family) or $27 (regular PayPal - for fees).\n\nThis is a beautiful card. Take a look. The front is really nice. The reason for the lower grade is because there is tape residue on the back. But you can still read everything on the back. This is a much nicer card for the grade.\n\nHere is a link to view the card.\n[URL=\"http://cyscards.com/t205/05-097.html\"]Click here to view the card.[/URL]\n\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back.\nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board.\nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nCy",
