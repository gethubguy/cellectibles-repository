      "post_content": "Hey guys, with an investment group that are looking for the remaining 1919 Coupon Cigarettes T213 Type 3 Factory 8 Overprint HOFers. These are super rare and most were owned by one guy in New Orleans and went MIA to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 landing them at bottom of the Mississippi Rivers' murky waters and making them ridiculously rare now. Serious investors, serious money. Thank you gentleman, Chris.",
