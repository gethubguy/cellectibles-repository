      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following T205 card for sale or trade. This is the \"stray line of type\" variation of the Patrick Moran card.  By most accounts, this is the 3rd or 4th toughest card in the set, behind the Hoblitzell \"no stats\", Wilhelm \"suffered\", and possibly the Mathewson \"1 loss\".  This one is obviously low grade, but fully intact with no paper loss or major damage beyond the extensive creasing.  \n\nAs an interesting bonus, this one is also missing a layer of gold on the border, making it a scarce yellow/tan border variation as is sometimes seen with this set. \n\n**CARD IS SOLD.  THANKS FOR LOOKING!**",
