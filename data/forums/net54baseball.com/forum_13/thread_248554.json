By far the nicest one I've owned, but I've only had a total of 3. the issue in the one corner is some minor creasing/cracking, there is some light staining on the reverse. \n\nAsking $300, will consider offers, but will probably wait a day or two before I respond to lower than full asking.\n\nWill obviously ship insured and well packaged and I always ship and insure at no additional cost. \n\nPaypal goods and services only.\n\n[IMG]http://www.ebssportscards.com/2017/december/t200/pirates.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.ebssportscards.com/2017/december/t200/piratesback.jpg[/IMG]",
