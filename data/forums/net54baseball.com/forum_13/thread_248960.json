      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking to trade this Red Cross tobacco pouch (seal is broken, but the tobacco is still inside).  Would be interested in T215 cards (low grade), among others (I collect a lot of random stuff).  Or for sale, $575.\n\nWhile I've chewed 30 year-old Topps bubble gum, I haven't tried chewing or smoking this tobacco, so I can't confirm whether or not it's sweet (as advertised).  :D\n\nI can provide the full-size photos via email.\n\nEmail only, no PMs.\n\nCheers,\nSteve",
