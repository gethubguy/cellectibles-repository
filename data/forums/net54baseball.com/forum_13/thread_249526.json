Better yet, if you would be willing to part with it, please let me know. \n\nI have the other more common ones (Piedmont Factory 25, Polar Bear, Sovereign, Honest Long Cut, Sweet Caporal 25 Black and Red, Sweet Caporal 42 Black).  They are part of my on-going Daubert Master Set so they are not for sale.  I'm just wondering whether I should keep looking for the ones I don't have.  Thanks.",
