      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nWe recently acquired a T205 tobacco baseball card set, mostly graded by PSA or SGC, it includes most of the variations (missing the Hoblitzell no stats), and it includes a Latham Drum back.  Here are a couple of group shots, and feel free to email me for a complete spread sheet list of every card.\n\nPrice $25,000\n\nRegards,\n\nBryan Dec\n\n810-664-1790\n\n[url]bryan@bdecsports.com[/url]",
