      "post_content": "Del Pratt T211 for sale or trade. Minor league card of well known player from days with Browns, Yankees, and Red Sox (and the 1914 CJ set).  Also played football for the University of Alabama and Georgia Tech (I think). \n\nI'm asking $300 net to me. Would also consider a trade, especially if you have a T210-8 Pratt or a T210-3 Burch to trade. Also looking for Harry Hooper and other Del Pratt cards.",
