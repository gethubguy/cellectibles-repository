      "post_content": "All forms of payment accepted. Shipping is a flat $5 if you buy 1 card or all of them. \n\nFor trading I prefer SGC or ungraded for the T210s and ungraded for the others. \n\nT210s I would trade for are lower grade Series 3 cards of Coyle, Francis, Jolley, McKay, Morris, Pendelton, and Weeks. Trimmed and hole punched cards are OK also. The Morris is a higher valued card so I would trade in your favor since it would take several of mine to equal the same value.\n\nWould also trade for these 1955 Bowmans to finish my set. Also looking for lower grade cards in this set. 235 Joe Paparella, 242 Ernie Banks, 277 Ed Runge, 286 Frank Secory, 291 Frank Dasconi, 293 Thomas Gorman, 302 Frank Malzone, 307 Babe Pinelli\n\nWould also trade for lower grade 1959 Fleer Ted Williams cards for a beater set I am putting together.\n\nI scanned most of these with the sleeve over the slab so if you would like a better scan just ask.\n\nSeries 1\nNorcum $40 SOLD\nMarshall $40 SOLD\nRadebaugh $40 SOLD\nHoward $65 SOLD\n\nSeries 2\nSchrader $75 SOLD\nSharp $40 SOLD\nKirkpatrick $40 SOLD\n\nSeries 3\nRose $40\nHill $50\nGlawe $35\nCarlin $35\nEns $40\nSpangler $30\nOgle $15 SOLD\nBurk $25 SOLD\nBelew $25 SOLD\nWilliams $25 SOLD\n\nSeries 5\nWalker $40 SOLD\nTemplin $40\nHicks $40\n\nSeries 7\nSteinbach $40",
