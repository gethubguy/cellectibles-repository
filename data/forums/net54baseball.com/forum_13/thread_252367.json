      "post_content": "Great example of a sharp looking ghost or wet sheet transfer. This Collins had his own Piedmont reverse \"ghosted\" onto the front.  The transfer is very sharp and clear too.  The text is perfectly ledgible for those gifted with the ability to read backwards :)\n\nCondition-wise, this is a solid VG/EX card with only the slight touches to the corners.  No wear or wrinkling at all.  Asking $1100 delivered.  Would also consider trades for t204 HOFers, or Ruth/Wagner/Cobb cards.  Would make a terrific addition to a t205 or Oddity/Print error collector.\n\n***  COLLINS IS NOW SOLD....THANKS ALL! ***\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=308368&d=1520740245[/IMG]",
