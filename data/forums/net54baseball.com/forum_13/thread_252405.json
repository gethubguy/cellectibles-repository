Here you can see the Old Mill Reverse is very sharp and easily readable on the front of this Series 8 Bauer.  \n\nAsking $1195 delivered....would also trade for t204 HOFers, e107 HOFers or Ruth/Cobb/Wagner cards\n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=308478&d=1520806085[/IMG]",
