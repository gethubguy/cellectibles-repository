See high res scans for closeups of the corner wear, etc.\n\nAs seen in the scans, the front does have what appears to be 2 small tape marks at the top and bottom of the card, but there is no paper loss in these areas.  This is likely what knocked it down to a \"3\". \n\nIf you click on the imgur links you can see high resolution scans (300 dpi). Thanks!\n\nhigh res:  [IMG]https://i.imgur.com/VNI4UOr.jpg[/IMG]\n\nhigh res:  [IMG]https://i.imgur.com/Igsmtk1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/gKfui2k.jpg[/IMG]",
