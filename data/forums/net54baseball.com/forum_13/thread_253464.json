Prices are negotiable too, of course....especially if buying multiple cards\n\nIf you see anything you want or need, just let me know. I accept paypal and money orders with shipment on receipt of payment. I will also be listing these on eBay over the next few days.\n\nThanks for looking![/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nPm sent\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
