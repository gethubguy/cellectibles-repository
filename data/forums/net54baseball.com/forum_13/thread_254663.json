      "post_content": "At this point, I do enjoy collecting both the T205's and T206's, but found out \ncost-wise it would be expensive to try and go for both sets, so I am \nparting with my T205's. I am preferring the T206's, and for the T205's, I don't have any of the real big cards.  I am open to a trade or \ncash/trade for T206's \n(Please see below)\n\n*** STARTER SET HAS BEEN SOLD ***\n\n\nAll low grade cards, backs overall are decent, with a majority of the cards \nshowing legible text --Still, it's a partial set for somebody that is not \nconcerned with condition.",
