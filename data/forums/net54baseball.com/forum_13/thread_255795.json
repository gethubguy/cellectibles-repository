Here are all the cards: [url]https://flickr.com/photos/16708997@N00/sets/72157696930764584[/url]\n\nThere is no Cobb, Johnson, Young, or Matty in this group, but there are a lot of difficult cards and still a ton of HOFers and the whole set of MLers.\n\nHOFers: Baker, Bresnahan, Bender (SGC 35), Brown, Chance (Cycle PSA A), Clarke, Duffy, Huggins, Joss (SGC 10), McGraw (SGC 10), Speaker, Tinker, Wallace with cap, Walsh (PSA 1mk), Wallace no cap 2 line (SGC 20), Wheat\n\nSPs: Fisher, Grant (SGC 10), Karger, Kleinow (SGC 10), Rowan, Suggs, Sweeney, Turner, Vaughn, White Kirb\n\nMLers: All 12 \n\nVARIATIONS: Barger partial B, Chase left ear, Dahlen (SGC 10), Dougherty red sock (SGC 20), Ford white cap, Graham Cubs (SGC 40), Gray with stats (SGC 10), Shean Cubs, Wiltse right ear.\n\nThere are a lot of \"money\" cards in this lot such as the Joss, Graham Cubs, Gray with stats, etc.\n\nThe condition of the cards varies but alot of them are in poor to fair condition.  The SMR value for all the cards as PSA 1 is around $3600 but the break value is definitely higher.  I'm asking $3400 for the group but will listen to offers.\n\nNot interested in splitting them up. ;)",
