      "post_content": "Recent purchase at REA. Possibly one of the steals of that auction. A no offer back T3 Cobb. Card has very nice corners. One deep crease. Likely 10 or fewer of these are known to exist. Iconic card of possibly the hottest player on the pre-WW1 market where 10 or fewer examples exist. Such a clean bright piece.\n\nOriginally bought as a buy and hold...was never meant to be a flip. The purchase of one of my personal grails necessitates either selling this or dipping into savings. I don't like to dip into savings but will if I have to. Not going to give this bad boy away.\n\nAsking SOLD delivered.\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/cobb%20T3_zpsqcv3bmmz.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/item_49514_2_zpss3vp6lgd.jpg[/IMG]",
