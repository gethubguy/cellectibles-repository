I don't think I ever saw an email address but guess I could have missed it with the other novel it was sent in :).  I know they were just picture addresses but it was large. IF you sent it to my email I never received it. If you could resend I can check my spam folder. ANd thanks for getting with everyone else already. \n Much appreciated. \nthanks again\nleon",
