This one is held back by the lightest of corner creases that extends 1.5 inches up from the corner to 1.5 inches accross the bottom from the corner. It is so light that the only way to see it in the scan is if you look at the way bottom left of the image, you can see the wrinkle barely going diagonally. It is just about 100% in the border area of the card. \n\nLikely fewer than 10-15 examples of this card exist.\n\nAsking $800 delivered.",
