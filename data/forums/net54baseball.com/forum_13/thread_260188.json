I've tried for a while, even winning one on eBay but the seller sent the \"other\" Lee in the Series 1 set to me and the one I won to the guy who won the one I received and refused to give it up. Nice guy! He immediately realized he had the tougher Lee and sent it in for grading (he said). Bah humbug!\nAnyway, if anyone out there has this card, please let me know, I'll be glad to make you a good offer for it. Thanks.\ntbob",
