      "post_content": "Hi Wayne. I collected and put together a complete 150 series set and it was a long journey. One tip I have is the very last card I needed and an extremely tough card to find was the 1910 T212 Obak series 150 Wolverton. Be on the look out for it. \nAlso a lot of sellers of Obak cards aren't aware of the difference between the 150 and 175 series and simply list the cards as \"1910 Obaks\" or \"1910 T212s\" so always check the back scans or inquire if there aren't any back scans.\nFinally, go to the internet and print out the complete listing of the 150 set cards to make the chore easier.\nGood luck!\ntbob",
