Open to offers on all that remain.\n\nUpdate 10/16 - Added 5 tough pops added. Everything moved to eBay Auctions with minimum bids. I'll pull anything except the 5 new additions, as long as they don't have bids.

Going camping tonight, so I'll likely be unresponsive to messages for about 24 hours starting 4 PM CST.\n\nUpdate 10/11 - Negotiations for the whole lot fell through. Currently negotiating on several cards for people who sent messages about specific cards in case the deal fell through. I'll give those priority for the next 24 hours on the cards marked \"in negotiations\" since they waited patiently. :) \n\nHey folks! \n\nThe following group of T210-8s are for sale. Most of these came from an original collection found in west Tennessee. The collection consisted of a large number of t210s (many of which I've offered for sale on here before) and T211s (not for sale). \n\nMost of the nicer conditioned cards were added later, the ones from the original collection were affixed to a scrapbook. Many were soaked. The more successful soaking efforts are evident, while some cards had been glued more than once and didn't soak as well. All cards are graded. Shipping is $3 flat.\n\nPrices and links to images listed. These will move to eBay on Sunday. \n\nBaylessAtlantaSGC 302.0pop 17 $80.00 SOLD\nGriffinAtlantaAuth0.5pop 8 $80.00 SOLD\nHanksAtlantaPSA2.0pop 8 [STRIKE]$100.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nHohnhorstAtlantaSGC 201.5pop 7[STRIKE] $80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD[/url]\nJordanAtlantaSGC 101.0pop 10 $80.00 SOLD\nMoranAtlantaSGC 101.0pop 7[STRIKE] $80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nSid SmithAtlantaSGC 101.0pop 7 [STRIKE]$80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nWalkerAtlantaSGC 201.5pop 4 [STRIKE]$150 [/STRIKE] SOLD\nKaneBirminghamPSA1.5pop 13 $80.00 SOLD\nMolesworthBirminghamSGC 101.0pop 5 $100.00 SOLD\nCrossMemphisSGC 101.0pop 8[STRIKE] $80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nFritzMemphisSGC 101.0pop 9 $100.00 SOLD\nBergerMobileAuth0.5pop 9 [STRIKE]$120.00[/STRIKE] No longer for sale\nBitroffMobileAuth0.5pop 4 $100.00 SOLD\nChappelleMobileSGC 201.5pop 13 $80.00 SOLD\nDunnMobileSGC 403.0pop 6 (2 higher) [STRIKE]$350.00 [/STRIKE]SOLD\nHickmanMobileSGC 352.5pop 10 [STRIKE]$130.00[/STRIKE] $100 SOLD\nHuelsmanMobileSGC 101.0pop 7 $80.00 SOLD\nSwacinaMobilePSA (MC)2.0pop 6 $180.00 SOLD\nWagnerMobileSGC 201.5pop 9 [STRIKE]$80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nDaly, JudMontgomeryBVG Auth0.5pop 4 $80.00 SOLD\nGremingerMontgomeryPSA5.0pop 8 (none higher) $350.00 No longer for sale\nHartMontgomerySGC 101.0pop 10 [STRIKE]$100 [/STRIKE]SOLD\nMcCreeryMontgomerySGC 101.0pop 7 $80.00 SOLD\nMillerMontgomerySGC302.0pop 6 $150.00 SOLD\nNolleyMontgomeryPSA2.0pop 8 [STRIKE]$100.00 [/STRIKE] $80SOLD\nPepeMontgomerySGC 201.5pop 12 $80.00 SOLD\nPrattMontgomerySGC 101.0pop 6[STRIKE]$80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nThomas - FieldingMontgomeryPSA (MK)1.5pop 7 [STRIKE]$150.00 [/STRIKE]SOLD\nBernhardNashvilleSGC 403.0pop 15 [STRIKE]$375.00[/STRIKE] $350 No longer for sale\nBronkieNashvillePSA3.0pop 10 $150.00 No longer for sale\nSiegleNashvilleSGC 201.5pop 7[STRIKE] $80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nVinsonNashvillePSA2.5pop 11 [STRIKE]$100.00 [/STRIKE] $80SOLD\nBreitensteinNew OrleansSGC 605.0pop 10 (1 higher) $250.00 No longer for sale\nBrooksNew OrleansSGC 201.5pop 5 [STRIKE]$80.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nDeMontrevilleNew OrleansSGC 201.5pop 6 [STRIKE]$100.00[/STRIKE] SOLD\nE.
