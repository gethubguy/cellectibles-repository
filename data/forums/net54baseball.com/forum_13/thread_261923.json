I also have a Needham, and I'm not aware of any other Cubs players with Blank Backs besides those two.  It's a little tough to tell from the pop reports, so there could definitely be cards I'm not aware of out there.  The Livingston is kind of cool in that PSA didn't notice that it's hand-cut and gave it a numerical grade\n\nLivingston PSA 2 $1200\n\nLennox SGC A $850",
