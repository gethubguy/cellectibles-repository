      "post_content": "Evening,\n\nI won consignment 439 from REA a few weeks ago and have finally evaluated the group of 31 cards.  Have sold off a few (Gibson, Chase, Hoblitzell and Wilson), plan on keeping the Cubs as upgrades and will be selling off the Cubs dupes at a later point.  The remaining cards are available for sale and will be taking/ negotiating offers.  If You have a reasonable deal in mind, ask.  The worst I can say is no and give you a counteroffer.\n\nPM me or contact me at [url]Cubkmac32@aol.com[/url] with inquiries.  Payment via paypal f/f please.  Thanks for looking.\nKen\n\nCurrent cards available all T205 AB backs in order of rarity\n\nRobert Ewing\nCharles Street\nDavid Shean\nGeorge Schlei\nEdward Konetchy\nFrank Corridon\nRobert Byrne\nRussell Blackburne\nJames Austin\nThomas Leach\nJohn Bates\n\nAnother wave will appear after the Cubbies are back from SGC.  Can send pics if you send a phone to text to or email to.  Feel free to make reasonable offers.",
