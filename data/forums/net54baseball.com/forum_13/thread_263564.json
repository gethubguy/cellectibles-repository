Hassan and Honest only. The Wallace 2 Line does exist with a Piedmont 25/42 reverse. Good luck!",

Now the 2 Line does exist with PB back. \n\nAlso, this is available if you need it, but it will be much more expensive than a 2 Line :)\n\n[IMG]http://i67.tinypic.com/4gsx2r.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/5d8687.jpg[/IMG]",
