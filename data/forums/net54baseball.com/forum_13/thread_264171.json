The reverse has been struck 4 times to produce this boldly printed anomaly.  Combined with the rarity of Broad Leaf backs, it makes for quite the card.\n\nThe price is SOLD, net to me, postpaid in the continental U.S.\n\nPlease contact me at [url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.  Thank you.\n\n[url]https://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/postcards/64255/bridwell[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/postcards/64256/bridwell[/IMG]",
