I paid $31 for it a couple of years ago, so that is what I am asking, plus $2 shipping.\n\nAny type of payment is fine.  Thanks much! Rick\n\nWill also trade this card, along with some cash on my part, for any of the T213-2 cards on my want list.\n\n[url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjdPmdFDVTYd9ardcAkAyB3FmmXdmeS3QCxfhnzleiQ/edit#gid=878139990[/url]",
