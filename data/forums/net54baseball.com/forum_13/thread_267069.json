I have noticed recently on some pics i have to right click on the broken link, open them in a new page and log in for a second time. Then I can go back to the original page and reload it and the pics will show up. It has been happening for me off and on for easily over a year.\n\nOne of the more computer savvy members explained why but I don't remember his explanation.",
