      "post_content": "I'd like to add a couple T-cards to my lower-grade Cardinals set and am hoping that someone can help me out. I'm looking for PSA/SGC 1-3 range cards. Some paper loss and writing on the back are okay but the front must be nicely centered with good eye appeal and no heavy creases. Rounded corners are fine. Here is what I currently have. I need the rest.\n\nT202\nCatching Him Napping\n\nT205\nBresnahan (closed mouth)\nLush\nCorridon\n\nT206\nBresnahan (portrait)\nByrne\nGilbert\nHulswit\nWillis (throwing)\n\nT207\nSteinfeldt\n\nI can only afford a couple for now but might be able to work out a deal for more in the future. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nChris",
