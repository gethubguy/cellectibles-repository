So whenever we sell it they have partial claim to the money. So we make payments to them every so often to reduce their share in the car. \n\nIt also sat outside in Vegas for 10-15 years not running. It does run, but there are some issues with it, like no working speedometer, and only half the windows rolling down. Some other odd and end things here and there. Upholstery is fragile and will probably need to be replaced eventualy. \n\nBut it is a sweet ride. Uncle cut the springs, and so everywhere we go is low and slow.  :)\n\nSent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G930A using Tapatalk",
