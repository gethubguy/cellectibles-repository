I believe I have seen every card in the T210-8 set in person at one time or another except the Osteen and there is suppose to be a Thomas- Portrait, but I have yet to see that one either. Both played for Montgomery, I believe...\n\n- Thnx to board member who sent me a link to a sold set of T210's back in 2006 and I was able to roughly view the Osteen and Thomas - Montgomery Port. I have actually seen an Osteen before, but still have never seen the Montgomery Port of Thomas in person.  This set is littered with super rare cards.",
