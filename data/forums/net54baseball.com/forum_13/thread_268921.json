It also looks like I wanted three cards that Kin had asked about on May 25th above.  They were all $10 or less.  So if Kin said he would take them on the 25th, then I should've been told they weren't available when I asked about them on June 9th.  But I received images of them from Andy when I asked about them and then paid for them that night.  Anyways, like others have said, I hope everything is ok with Andy.",
