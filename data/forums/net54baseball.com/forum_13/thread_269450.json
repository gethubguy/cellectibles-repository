      "post_content": "I recently completed my Sovereign T205 run, and have a few extras floating around, so I'm looking for traders to make progress on my T206 Sovereign run.  Condition isn't a big issue for me, as I'll upgrade along the way.  That's how I ended up with Mr. Fletcher, below.  If you look closely, you can see that it has a dinged corner, and a touch of paper loss on the back.  If you have a similar T206 to trade, let me know!\n\nTake Care,\nGeno\n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47942426157_c3da5f8470_z.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47942461261_545a21ac7a_z.jpg[/img]",
