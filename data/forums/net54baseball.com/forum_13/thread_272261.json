      "post_content": "Hi all,\nI have these tough T207s are for sale or trade.  Scans can be found at \n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/album.php?albumid=1134[/url]\n\nFeel free to make offers on multiple cards.  As always, a firm \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d trumps ongoing negotiations.\n\nI am looking for these T207 in VG or better condition: Adams, Bauman, Bushelman, Butcher, Donnelly, McCarthy, Ragan, Saier, Sweeney\n\n\nNOTE TO CONDITION: T207s have narrower borders than many other tobacco issues, and PSA is VERY tough on them, putting the MC label on some cards that in other sets would be minor centering problems.  Take a close look at the Engle and the Coulson scans - I don\u2019t feel they should be labeled as miscut since you can (arguably) see the black frame all the way around the card.  At any rate, I think a lot of T207 collectors put little stock in PSA\u2019s MC grades for this set.\n\nGRADED\nEngle (Recruit 240) \u2013 one of the most difficult Recruit cards -  PSA2 MC, looks nicer  SOLD\n\nCoulson (Recruit 606)\u2013  PSA6 MC, $100\n\nBirmingham (Cycle) \u2013 SGC30   - $300\n\nRasmussen (Cycle) \u2013 PSA1.5  - $375\n\nRasmussen (Broadleaf) \u2013 SGC40  - $350\n\nUNGRADED:\n\nRucker (Recruit 240) \u2013 another of the most difficult Recruit cards \u2013 Poor  $50\n\nPhelan (very tough Anonymous Factory 3 back) \u2013 Good   $170  SOLD\n\nRoy Miller (Broadleaf) G-VG  - $200\n\nGregg (Broadleaf) - VG-EX with note to miscut-  $175\n\nMogridge (Broadleaf) My long research into T207 has shown me that a few cards are at least as difficult as the three supposed rarities that command big money (Lewis, Lowdermilk, Miller).  One of the bigger secrets about the set is how tough Mogridge is.  There are currently fewer copies of him in the population reports than any other player.   Fair front, glue residue on back but fully legible. $300   SOLD\n\nHouser (Broadleaf) one of the five or six most difficult cards in the set; fewer cards of him have been graded than any except Mogridge \u2013 Poor   $180\n\nWoodburn (Anonymous Factory ?) \u2013 P-F   $125\n\nNelson (Anonymous Factory 3) \u2013 Fair  $150\n\nKuhn (Anonymous Factory 25) \u2013 one of the ten most difficult cards in the set - P-F  SOLD\n\nHerzog (Broadleaf) (the easiest Broadleaf/Cycle card :) ) G-VG -  $125",
