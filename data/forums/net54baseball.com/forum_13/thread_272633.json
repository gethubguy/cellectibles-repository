All series considered on the T210's with an emphasis on 5, 6, 7 making up my want list. I also have some cards for trade if you prefer in the same designations. I may even have a T206 or two to pull out and offer. Thank you for any help!\n\nJason",

I scour eBay and other sources but nada. I did pick up (finally) a Dudley which completed series 1 for me but that card was really a booger, waited 5 years for it.\nBest,\ntbob",
