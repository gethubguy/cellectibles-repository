I'm just getting started with it, so pretty much interested in anything.\n\nI have a few, but potentially looking to upgrade so let me know what you've got.  I'm mostly looking for 3s to 6s, but I'd probably consider just about anything.\n\nI haven't done all my research yet, so I'm assuming all the below exist.  I do know about the Cycle 1 loss, and I would definitely be interested in acquiring that as well.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nPM or email to [url]david@davidratliff.com[/url].\n\n\nAmerican Beauty (Green)\nCycle\n[STRIKE]Honest Long Cut[/STRIKE]\nHassan Factory 30\nPiedmont Factory 42\n[STRIKE]Piedmont Factory 25[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Polar Bear[/STRIKE]\nSovereign\n[STRIKE]Sweet Caporal Factory 42 (Red)[/STRIKE]\n\n[STRIKE]American Beauty (Black) - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Broadleaf (Brown) - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Broadleaf (Black) - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Drum - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Hindu - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Hassan Factory 649 - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Sweet Caporal Factory 42 (Black) - DNE[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Sweet Caporal Factory 25 (Black) - DNE[/STRIKE]\n\n\nI also have these to sell/trade toward the ones I don't have if that's more interesting.\n\nPSA 4 - $1600 OBO\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Mr42PS0l.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/Hmvhm7tl.jpg[/img]",
