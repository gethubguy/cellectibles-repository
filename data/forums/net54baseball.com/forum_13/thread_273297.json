It is not graded, and I am not experienced in that realm so have no guess as to what it would grade out. Check scans - tops corners look good, bottom not so much (makes sense as the top ones were folded down).\n\nI really don't have a great grasp for what this is worth, so I'm asking $85 shipped OBO. Feel free to send offers.",
