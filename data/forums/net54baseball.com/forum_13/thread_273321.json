I know it makes me a bottom feeder but looking to get types as low end, low grade, cheap as possible. Have a few on the way and looking on Ebay but just as soon buy from board members if I can. Post here or PM if you have anything that fits the bill that you would be willing to part with. If I dont message back in a day or 2 Im not ignoring you Im just waiting and looking at everything that gets offered. Thanks.",
