      "post_content": "SOLD\n\nMcBride was the Washington Senators regular shortstop for 9 years, from 1908 thru 1916. Not much of a hitter, McBride was considered by many to be the premier defensive shortstop of his time. This is a very nice looking, collector-grade card. I guarantee it will receive a grade of at least Fair from PSA, SGC, and BVG. $150 delivered, with payment via check or m.o. - $155 via regular PayPal (please do NOT use PayPal Friends & Family).\n\nTrades considered for cards I don't have of these players who were on the 1924 Washington Senators championship team: Ossie Bluege, Goose Goslin, Clark Griffith, Wm. Hargrave, Bucky Harris, Walter Johnson, Joe Judge, Nemo Leibold, Fred Marberry, Earl McNeely, George Mogridge, Warren Ogden, Roger Peckinpaugh, Sam Rice, Muddy Ruel, Benny/Bennie Tate, Tom Zachary, & all others.\n\nSOLD",
