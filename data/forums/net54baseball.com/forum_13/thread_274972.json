      "post_content": "Up for sale is a t213 Jennings and a t210 Busch for sale. Busch is in really great condition but I haven't collected t210's in about ten year. Note that the tape shown across the card is OUTSIDE the holder - it isn't a crease. Card looks like at the very least a 3 and I guarantee it grades numerically. The Jennings is for $60 and the Busch is for $75.
