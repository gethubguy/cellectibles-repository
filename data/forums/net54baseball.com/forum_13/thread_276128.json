      "post_content": "Purchased a complete set of 1910 T212 Obak from Bud Obermeyer in 2011. The entire set (175 cards) is graded by SGC with no upgrades/changes from how it is listed (#3) in the legacy SGC registry.\n\n-- [url]https://sgclegacy.com/usersetcomposition.aspx?id=0&usersetid=6454[/url]\n\nNot much of a prewar collector and have been considering selling it for a couple of years. Finally ready to do so. Listing it here first to hear any offers, otherwise will most likely consign it to REA Spring 2020 auction.\n\nDon't have the entire set scanned, but I can provide photos of any/all cards upon request.",
