      "post_content": "Have this nice Eddie Collins T3 available for sale. Asking what I paid....$SOLD.  \n\nReally a great card but doesn\u2019t fit my collection. Corners have some dings and a kid marked a few Ax\u2019s on t he back which is why it has the (MK) designation.  All in all a solid HOFer T3.  Plus it\u2019s already graded.....so you get to avoid that T3 grading expense!\n\nPM me with any questions or if you want to make an offer.\n\nThanks for looking\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2hXCp8B][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49199909957_be71b339f1_c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2hXBnyL][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49199709576_9eff0c2bd1_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
