      "post_content": "1911 Obak Kane, Vernon \n\nThis card was originally in an SGC 30 holder, which i suspected was due to being in an album at one time and I thought too harshly graded. So I cracked it and sent it to PSA, which it came back AUT. I can tell the top and right edges are rolled over and 100% original. It's possible the left edge is trimmed as the card is maybe 1/32\" short side to side but not overly. SO who is right? Hard to say.\n\nI am offering it is as is, in other words possibly trimmed, sold as is. \n\nOther than that it is a blazer of a card.\n\n$65 delivered      Check, MO or PP F/F",
