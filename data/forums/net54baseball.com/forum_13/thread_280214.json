      "post_content": "I would like to buy some T205 lots (10 to 50+ cards).\n\nCreases and general wear are fine but not interested in cards with holes, paper loss, missing pieces or writing.  \n\nLots with a good mixture of different backs, short runs, minor leaguers, minor stars HOF'ers preferred.\n\nPlease contact me at [url]mikebrailey@yahoo.com[/url] if you have any available with description and pricing.\n\nThanks,\nMike\nEmail:  [url]mikebrailey@yahoo.com[/url]",
