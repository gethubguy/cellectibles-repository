It is visible to the right of Johnny Bates's head.  It does present very nicely for the relative condition.\n\n$SOLD net to me, postpaid via fortified PWE in the continental U.S. $SOLD via bubble mailer. Your choice.\n\nCommitment to purchase outweighs any ongoing negotiations. :rolleyes:\n\n[url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/71725/t202[/IMG]",
