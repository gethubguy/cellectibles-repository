      "post_content": "Offered for sale here are two unique B-18 blankets that exhibit factory over  spray errors. Both blankets have significant red die/ink over spray on the reverse. The Keating exhibits the over spray / bleed through on the front side border and the Wiltse shows some over spray on the front side border. I have collected B-18 Blankets for many years and these two are the only ones I have seen with this type of error. T206 error cards are quite valuable and while these are one of a kind and rare they are offered at a slight premium due to the unique nature of the errors. Great companion pieces for the B-18 collector. USPS mail free with paypal f & f.\nKeating     45.00\nWiltse       55.00",
