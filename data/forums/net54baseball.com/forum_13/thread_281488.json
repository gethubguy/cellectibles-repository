      "post_content": "Hello everyone,  I am currently a new member here.  I have sold a few cards on eBay and while doing some research, I found this site.\nI am selling for a friend a partial collection of T227 cards as well as a partial collection of T219 boxing cards. \nThese cards have been in his family for 75+ years, they are a original collection from his father and most of the cards are in very nice condition for their age.  \nAll of the cards in the T227 series are Miners Extra and the T219 cards have some Honest trademarks.\n\nNaturally none of these cards have been graded, but as mentioned above, they are in good condition.  \n\nIf you are interested in any of these cards, just contact me and I will provide pictures\n\nFor everyone who has expressed interest in these cards, please be patient.  I will get the cards organized and post pictures after Easter.  I will reply to everyone who has sent a message.\nWe have some duplicates of each set, if you need just a card or two, let me know and I'll see if it's available.\n\nThank you for your interest in these cards",
