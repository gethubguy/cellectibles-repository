      "post_content": "I have the following 7 fairly messed up T202 cards with obvious big time issues.  Does include Cy Young, Frank Baker, Joe Tinker and Clark Griffith on the ends, a John McGraw and Chief Bender center panel\n\nThe price for the lot is $120.00, with free shipping. PM if you have any questions about individual cards.\n\nI also will have low condition group lots of T205 (includes Ed Walsh and Minor League card) and 1934 Goudey cards with 5 HOF including Dizzy Dean, and a group lot of 1933 Goudey that verges on okay condition and has 13 Hall of Famers including Mel Ott.\n\nThere will be a 10% discount off total if 2 or 3 of these groups are purchased, and 15% if all 4 are purchased.  Commitment to buy snags these cards, and I will ship promptly and securely. PM's preferred. Fronts and backs of each of the cards are pictured below. \n\nBrian",
