      "post_content": "I have the following 15 fairly messed up T205 cards with obvious big time issues. Does include Hall of Fame pitcher Ed Walsh, short print of George Suggs, and Minor League card of Doc Adkins.\n\nThe price for the lot is $150.00, with free shipping. PM if you have any questions about individual cards.\n\nI also will have low condition group lots of T202 which includes Cy Young and 5 other Hall of famers, 1934 Goudey cards with 5 HOF including Dizzy Dean, and a group lot of 1933 Goudey that verges on okay condition and has 13 Hall of Famers including Mel Ott.\n\nThere will be a 10% discount off total if 2 or 3 of these groups are purchased, and 15% if all 4 are purchased. Commitment to buy snags these cards, and I will ship promptly and securely. PM's preferred. Fronts and backs of each of the cards are pictured below.",
