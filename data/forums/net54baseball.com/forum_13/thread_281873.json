      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nLooking to add to my Cub prewar HOF collection. Primarily looking for rare cards (T216, T213, T214, T215, T204, etc.) but still have many more common ones to find as well. Condition not a major concern for the rarer ones.\n\nPlease let me know if have any that you're willing to sell.\n\nThanks!\n\nAndy",
