I hope folks enjoy well centered and clean, gold bordered cards? :)  I will be adding more to this thread often. \"I will take it\" trumps all negotiations. PM's, emails and board posts are all fine and all time stamped. First in first out. Enjoy. \n\nShipping is $3 and which includes USPS 1st class with tracking. Anything more must be requested in writing and paid for. Prices are net to me.  References upon request. :cool:\n\n*Prices will remain up so others can be more knowledgeable. \n** I will hold cards for later shipping, with others bought, but they must be paid for to be held. \n\nArcher $78 (sold)\nAustin $72 (sold)\nBates $125 (sold)\nBeck $69\nBarger Full B $42\nBarry $50 (sold)\nBell $75\nBescher $63 (sold) \n\n[IMG]https://luckeycards.com/t205a.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://luckeycards.com/t205ab_0001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://luckeycards.com/t205b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://luckeycards.com/t205bb.jpg[/IMG]",
