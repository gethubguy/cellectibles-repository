      "post_content": "Offered for sale here is a 1913 T200 Fatima Team Card of the Detroit Americans with HOF's Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford and Hughie Jennings. The card is bright and clear and visually looks great on the front and back. PSA is tough on Fatima's in particular.  If you hold the card sideways and get the right angle under the light you can see some cracks or creasing but none break the surface of the card. Looking straight on the card looks great as you can see in the pictures. I just got it back from PSA so it is freshly graded. Item is no longer available",
