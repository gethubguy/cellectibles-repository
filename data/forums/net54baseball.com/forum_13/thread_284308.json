      "post_content": "Available is the t205 PJ Moran \"Stray Line Below Stats\" PSA 4\n\nIt is the 4th toughest t205 PSA card to obtain (Mathewson-Cycle, Hoblitzell No stats and Wilhelm \"Suffered\" are the first 3).  It's been nearly four years since a 4 or better has sold online. I'm selling as I was fortunate enough to find a PSA 5 for my set a few months ago.  The last online sale of a PSA 3 was 2 years ago and was in excess of $2k.\n\nI've contemplated keeping it as it presents very well but I think I only need one of these!!  \n\n$2,900 via FF or $2,975 PP goods.  Checks or Money orders are ok, too.  Insured USPS shipping included.\n\nWould also consider trading for any t205 or t206 that would be an upgrade to my set, too.  \n\nThanks and feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss.",
