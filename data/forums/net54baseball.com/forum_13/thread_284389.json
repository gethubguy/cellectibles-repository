      "post_content": "FS: T205 Piedmont 400 Gold Border Chief Bender HOF PSA 2.5 GOOD+. Its a card I really like but I impulsively bought in the middle of the night last week and overspent my budget for. It was up on ebay for $195 or make an offer. I offered $169 and it was accepted. There is a diagonal crease in the top left corner and some rounding of the edges, but its still a nice card, right? The seller does not accept returns, and I wasn't about to make up some excuse of why the card isn't what was advertised. I want to purchase a cheaper (lesser) Bender. Seeking $150 OBO. Paypal F&F please or add 3% to total. Message me if interested.",
