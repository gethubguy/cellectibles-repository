Accepting Paypal only.\n\nThe discounts below will be based upon the overall amount of cards purchased from any of the 9 separate listings I have posted in this category, 'E' cards and the 1920 to 1949 category, not just within this listing.\n\nLooking to sell the cards in my various listings I am posting, so I am offering the following discounts for larger purchases: \n\nBuy 3 or more cards, free shipping\nBuy 6 or more cards, 10% off \nBuy 12 or more, 15% off. Commitment to buy snags these cards, and I will ship promptly and securely in a padded envelope.
