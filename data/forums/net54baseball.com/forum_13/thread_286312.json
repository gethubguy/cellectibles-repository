      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve owned this T3 Waddell for quite some time.  Never submitted to a TPG but I\u2019ve always estimated it at a 4 - 4.5. \n\nBeautiful colors and clarity.  Aside from honest corner wear, there are no creases or wrinkles.  Simply a great card.  I\u2019d be happy to send better hi-res photos if you\u2019d like.  \n\nWaddell is not an easy T3 and this one is very nice.  I\u2019ve been asking SOLD (net to me, including FedEx shipping) but will consider reasonable offers.  \n\nThanks,\nCraig",
