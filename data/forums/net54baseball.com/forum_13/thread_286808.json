      "post_content": "I am selling custom playing cards. $25 a deck and you don't pay until it is complete and printed. Takes about 10 to 14 days to edit, print, and ship. Here are some I have done for people. People have asked. These are high quality cards that can be used for playing or display. You pay nothing until you see the final printed design.
