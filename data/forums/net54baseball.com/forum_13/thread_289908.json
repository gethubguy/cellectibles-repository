In the \u201csearch\u201d I typed \u201cc46\u201d and I\u2019m wondering if the three characters were too small of a word to look up. \n\nI\u2019ll be hunting. It\u2019s funny, I saw those cards were still up at 8:00 am. I went to Home Depot, by the time I got home, they were gone. I was looking at them all weekend, thinking It over, and then didn\u2019t pull the trigger",
