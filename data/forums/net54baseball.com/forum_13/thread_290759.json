Thanx to one of our very own members,  most collectors believe that this particular 202 depicts the one and only Joe Jackson. The enclosed scans show a nice presentable front and a back with some paper loss. Feel free to ask any questions via PM/email/board posting. Asking 425.00 dollars Paypal net to me. Ins/Priority Mail shipping, 20.00. 1`st \"I`ll take it\" is the new owner. Thanx for looking....Murph\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2jvEYDr][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50218897563_6d3df18251_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2jvEYDr]T202&#x60;s, Lord Catches Man...Scharfer Play At First[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/154296763@N05/]Hugh Murphy[/url], on Flickr\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2jDwqZY][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50307762178_b9de0350ff_b.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2jDwqZY]Untitled[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/154296763@N05/]Hugh Murphy[/url], on Flickr",
