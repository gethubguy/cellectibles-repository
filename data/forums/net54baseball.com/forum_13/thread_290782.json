The auctioneer said the consignor was in his 80\u2019s and the cards were his fathers. This is certainly a 3 and possibly a 4. No creases. Also listed it on eBay if you want to supersize the pics. Asking $4,200 PayPal friends.",

      "post_content": "PSA isn't nearly as backed up as you might think, at least not when it comes to the good stuff. For example, I submitted a '33 Goudey Ruth card to them. The card was delivered on 10/16/20. The next day, they emailed me to tell me it was received. They then graded it and shipped it back to me on 10/19/20. That is a 3-day turnaround with a weekend sandwiched in between! This was submitted at the \"Super Express\" level, which would, I believe, be the same level you would be looking to submit the Cobb at ($4999 max declared value).",
