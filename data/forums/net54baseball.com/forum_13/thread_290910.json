Mid 80s.  Dad saw Gandil and bought it.  I sort of neglected the card over the years, but it has grown on me.  The set has really grown on me as I am about to attempt at completing this little set.\n\nWonderful card.  Thanks for posting it here.",

I know there have been a few troubling transactions lately mentioned on the main page in recent days, but thanks to Leon and the other moderators, almost all BST transactions are perfect.\nAnyways, thanks for the wonderful Gandil, a card I owned years ago and am so happy to have back.....and thanks for excepting a good ole fashioned money order!\nTim Kindler",
