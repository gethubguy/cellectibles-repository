I'd prefer the cards to be nicely centered with limited chipping & corner rounding. \n\nPsa and Sgc examples are welcome in the 4, 5, 6 and 7 graded range.\n\nIf you have any available which fit this criteria please drop me a PM or email with what you might have.\n\nThanks all,\n\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]",
