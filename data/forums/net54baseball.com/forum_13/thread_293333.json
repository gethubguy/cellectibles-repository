      "post_content": "Hi - selling the two pictured cards:\n\n1914 T222 Stuffy McInnis PSA 4.5 - total PSA pop of 17, with only 2 5\u2019s and a 6 higher than this one.  Tough to find T222\u2019s this nice. $325\n\n1911 T201 Baker / Downie PSA 6 - nice card, case has a very small surface spider crack near the top of the card.  Nothing goes through to impact the card in any way. $160\n\nHappy to email along bigger scans if you would like - just let me know an email address and I can send right along to you.\n\nPayPal F/F preferred but happy to accept any other payment form - let me know any questions - thanks for looking!\n\nScott",
