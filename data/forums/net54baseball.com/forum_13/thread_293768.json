Do not see how to edit the thread subject line. \n\nI have just acquired a collection of 1911 S74 Silks. These were all assembled by a 15 year old in 1911. He passed away in 1962, and these were sitting in his son\u2019s home since then. It appears that he did not like the ad backs, because they have all been removed. YES, I am aware this makes them less valuable, and they are priced accordingly. Most are in pretty remarkable condition considering the age and materials. \n\nI have listed a bunch of them at Ebay (and ambitious prices to see if there is interest). Much rather sell them on the board, of course, so will listen to all reasonable offers. If you follow this link to [URL=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/154257813343?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649\"]Ty Cobb [/URL], you should be able to browse around at the scans of the ones I put up. I can provide scans of everything else. Just let me know.
