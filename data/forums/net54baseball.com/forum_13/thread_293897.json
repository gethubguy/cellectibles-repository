My son has joined me in passion for old cardboard. A lot of fun is now attached to this common Texas Leaguer. It is his first card; he wants to give one to each kid at our family reunion each year; to keep the joy of card collecting, going in the next generations. Sure, it is a silly thing but he wants to do it.  There aren't many out there but it is going to be fun hunting them down; raw or any grade.\n\nDoyle, Dallas\nT210 Series 3.\n\nbengehler5gmail.com\nalso is my Paypal acct\n\nI am a type card collector, especially E cards; so please include your wants/interests; I tend to bottom feed, 2's and down/raw. Eye appeal has always driven my collecting tastes, so not many hammered ones here.",

I love how my son has now taken a deep dive into the subject (Doyle) and is exhibiting the passion for history digging; looking for backstory, etc. \n.... just like his old man!",
