While all Piedmont Art Stamps are scarce, this one has the even scarcer Factory 42 back. \n \nI have had it listed on eBay at $795 and have received a few offers, but none high enough to pull the trigger.\n\n$SOLD net to me would get a deal done.\n \nemail me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1914piedmontstampextras/websize/1914%20Walsh%2042%20_extra_.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1914piedmontstampextras/websize/1914%20Walsh%2042%20_extra_%20_back_.jpg[/IMG]",
