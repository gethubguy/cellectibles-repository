I wonder if you or anyone else on the board has any provenance like the newspaper article that highlighted Joe getting thrown out at third base on the Tannehill & Lord card? Just judging by appearances, I'd say the subject is too short, has too much dark hair, ears that are not floppy enough, and a face that doesn't match Joe's. Just my call here.",
