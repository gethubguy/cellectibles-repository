      "post_content": "Here are two high eye appeal T205 SP's. Karger is crease free, but has a scratch on the back that looks like it was caused by a blade opening the cigarette pack.  It is clearer in hand than in the scan and likely means the card is only about good condition.  The Turner has the faintest small wrinkle only on back and maybe a pinhead of paper loss on back on the border by the name, again, likely g/vg.  \n\nCards are sold dollars each delivered to you.",
