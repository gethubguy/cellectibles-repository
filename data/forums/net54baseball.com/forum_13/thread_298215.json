This is an outstanding example of this fragile issue that's in VGEX condition with a couple of minor wrinkles.  Not exactly sure what these are going for now - been away for awhile.  Send offers to [url]old-baseball@sbcglobal.net[/url].  \n\nI will be selling off a good portion of my collection in the next few months including E120 and E121-120.  If you're looking for something specific, just ask at the above email.  I may have it.\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=142&pictureid=30146[/IMG]",
