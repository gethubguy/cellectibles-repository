T207 HOFer's with Napoleon back - 10 down, 3 to go.  Need Carey, Tinker, and Wheat \n\nThe Broadleaf-class Pirates.\nAs part of trying to put a master team set of Pirates together, Pittsburgh in tougher Broadleaf class cards are easier than the Recruit class. Need Alex McCarthy - Anonymous, Factory 25\n \nFor these cards any grade will do ... just looking to land 'em at some point.\n\nIf you've got one you'd care to part with, or can point me at one, I'd be obliged, and/or make it worth your while.\n\nThank you for looking.\n--\nMike Frohme\n502/712-0742\n[url]mikefrohme@yahoo.com[/url]",
