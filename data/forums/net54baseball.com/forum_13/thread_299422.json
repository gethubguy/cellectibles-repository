      "post_content": "if card is CENTERED and decent price, shape doesn't matter all that much. Raw or Graded. Marks, pinholes, paper loss, are all ok so long centering is decent. Rare backs, common backs, etc. If higher grade (and higher money) then must be VERY centered. If lower grade (and lower money), then just semi-centered is ok. \n\nI have plenty of money to spend for the right cards. \n\nemail at [url]rjustincarter@hotmail.com[/url] is best but can PM here (although I don't check it as much). obv send scan and price.",
