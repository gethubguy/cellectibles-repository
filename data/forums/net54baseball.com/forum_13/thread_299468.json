      "post_content": "I have a current consignment with Al Crisafulli at Love of the Game Auctions and  can highly recommend his AH, along with Scott at Collector Connection, both are members here.  REA and Heritage are also good AH's.  Consignment fees are very generous with these AH's especially if you have a group of T-206's.  In my experience, Al, Scott, and Calvin over at REA are very accessible, just give them a call and they'd be happy to have a conversation about the best way to sell your collection.\n\nEbay & PWCC will probably cost you too much in consignment fees to make sense plus its much more fun with an auction house.",

I think it is bad to run two similar cards at the same time. A long time ago I submitted a rare \"Lost In Space\" card PSA 9 to PWCC.  Lo and behold someone else submitted the exact same card.  They looked identical.  Theirs brought around $100 more than mine.  I never did understand that, and I remembered it to this day.  So, NO....I don't like to see identical cards up for sale at the same time.",

If you've got a rare bakery card and it's the only one in the sale, it may not get the attention it would if there were a couple dozen bakery cards that brought those specific collectors out of the woodwork.\n\nJust my semi-educated opinion, and obviously there can be exceptions.",
