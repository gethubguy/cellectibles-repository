The Daubert, Bodie and Hamilton are difficult to find in this grade or above.\n\nThe remaining two cards - Hageman and Thomas - are equally difficult, and come with the back notations familiar to many collectors as made by one of the legends of card collecting - Buck Barker.  While these two cards aren't in the best of shape, they are two of the tougher ones in the Recruit series.\n\nUsual rules on 'first to say \"I'll take it\" gets it.  Follow-ups on the thread, by PM, or email to [url]mikefrohme@yahoo.com[/url].\n\nThanks for looking.\n--\nMike \n-------------------------------------------------\nLionel Carter\n\nDaubert  - $175\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30161[/IMG]\n\nHamilton - $175\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30160[/IMG]\n\nBodie - $175\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30162[/IMG]\n\nButcher - [STRIKE]$225[/STRIKE] SOLD\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30159[/IMG]\n\nCollins - $105\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30158[/IMG]\n\nBuck Barker\n\nHageman -[STRIKE] $100[/STRIKE] SOLD\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30156[/IMG]\n\nThomas - $125\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1167&pictureid=30157[/IMG]",
