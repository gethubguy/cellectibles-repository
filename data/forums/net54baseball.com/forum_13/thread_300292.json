      "post_content": "Offered here is a Very Nice B18 Blanket of Kelly HOGF. His name is spelled incorrectly as Kelley. I originally thought it was Joe Kelley but another board member advised the player is Billy Kelly. (name still spelled wrong) . A second board member confirmed it is Joe Kelly the HOF noting the first base mans glove . Thanks to the board members for contributing. I always thought it was Joe Kelly as I have been collecting and trading this issue for many years. This is the purple pennant variation. This blanket has bright pennants with clear printing and excellent registration. It has 4 brown border. The back has a hint of factory overspray or wet sheet transfer. \n$40.00. SOLD",
