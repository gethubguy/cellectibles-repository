      "post_content": "Hello friends \u2026\n\nAs some of you know, I have acquired 98% of the beautiful T205 set over the past couple of years. I currently have 218 of the 221 cards, missing only \u201cMatty Cycle\u201d, \u201cHoblitzell no stats\u201d and \u201cWilhelm suffered\u201d. (No shame in missing those 3 \u2026. Is there?).\n\nAll of the cards have been slabbed (168 by SGC \u2026. nearly 70 of which graded within the past 6 months, and 50 by PSA), and range from AUTH to 4. The average grade is approximately a 1.8. All the cases are intact, and the cards within are secure in their holders.\n\nLet me cut to the chase \u2026 I\u2019m looking to sell the set, for reasons I\u2019d like to keep to myself and a few close friends. \n\nI had a knowledgeable friend of mine, who has extensive experience in collecting and valuing sets, take a look at my set, and based on their suggestion (and my own intuition) I have a price in mind.\n\nPlease note the following: I am NOT looking to trade this set for cards, nor am I looking for a partial cash/partial card deal. This will be a straight cash transaction. I am also NOT looking to break this set up and sell individual cards or groups of cards. I\u2019m offering, and selling, the virtually complete set.\n\nUpon receipt of your payment (exact method to be determined), I will ship the cards registered mail. If you are in the NYC metro area, I would not be averse to an in-person transaction.\n\nHere is a link to the list of cards with their grader and grade: [url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glckVI7HjuqtA9qr62CZO5aaSsGAAdpvNO9_2DhitQ4/edit?usp=sharing[/url]\n\nHere is a link to photos/scans of the \u201cBig 5\u201d: [url]https://photos.app.goo.gl/yYqFMsPcPFimoofX9[/url]\n\nHere is a link to photos/scans of approximately 70 recently SGC-graded cards: [url]https://photos.app.goo.gl/R6MBCCfu38dndMdr6[/url]\n\nI can provide photos of any other cards upon request \u2026. DM me if interested.\n\nThis is a \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d offer \u2026 please appreciate the scarcity of \u201c98% complete\u201d T205 sets and take a gander at the recent sale prices of T205 partial sets, before making an offer. Like I said \u2026 I have a number in mind and would appreciate you not wasting your time and mine sifting through clearly low-ball offers. Please DM me your offers \u2026. No need to clutter up the post with bids.\n\nReferences available upon request. \n\nThank you for your anticipated interest and I hope we can make a deal.",
