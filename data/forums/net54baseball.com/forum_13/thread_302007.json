Be prepared for that toughie to go higher or you might be waiting awhile. 90% of them, I acquired at reasonable prices... $200 or less. 10% of them I had to go high. Glad I did as there are a handful that don't come up too often. $300-$400 for those 10%... Higher grades might command more. The Champ has pent up demand, so lay low til that day.",
