      "post_content": "Offered here is an extremely nice example of a T201 Double Folder of Cicotte / Thoney. This particular example is quite nice with excellent color , centering and registration on the front and back. There is some toning on the back. I bought this along with others ungraded and sent it to PSA . After 8 months it came back 1 instead of a 4 which is what I expected. Upon closer inspection I still could not find the flaw. Finally holding it up to the sun there is a super tiny pinhole that is barely visible in the scan. It is located about 1/3 of the way in from the right above and centered from the trees. Otherwise this is a very nice example.\n$89.00 paypal f & f plus 8.00 for shipping in a usps flat rate box",
