Would especially like a Red Sun example if someone has one.[/QUOTE]\n\nIf you are looking for the variation card that exists in the T205 set, you won't find it in the S74-1 white silk set.  There is only the image that Ron sent you a scan of with full \"B\" on his cap. \n\nAlso, if you are a Brooklyn collector, why would you want Tony Smith on a Boston Rustlers silk?  And that Smith-Rustlers silk is an error anyway, he never played on the Rustlers and it is severely short printed.  There are only a few ad-backed Smith-Rustlers silks out there, probably less than 10, but only 3 for certain that I've ever actually seen online or in person.  In fact, I know people that have been looking for one for 10-20+ years, with no luck.  You aren't going to easily (or cheaply) find one.  FYI",

In my opinion, despite it saying Rustlers, it is still a Brooklyn card with an incorrect team name and makes for a great talking point when sharing my collection with fellow collectors. I would think Boston collectors would be less interested in owning this than Brooklyn collectors.",

I've seen one of these come up for sale maybe three times in the last 20+ years.  So good luck finding one.  It would definitely be a rare item in your collection worth talking about if you can.",
