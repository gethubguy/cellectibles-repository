      "post_content": "Offered here are two T201 Double Folders. The first is Speaker/E. Gardner. It is quite nice with excellent color, clarity, registration and centering. A light crease upper right corner and bottom rounded corners along with some toning on the back and what appear to be a couple of scrapes on the back I assume are the reasons this received a 1.5 instead of a higher grade. This along with the Cicotte Thoney I have posted before which also has excellent color, clarity, registration and centering which got a PSA 1 . The reason for the 1 on the Cicotte is a very small pinhole next to and above the tress on the right side of the card that is only visible when holding to the light and looking very carefully as the pinhole is tiny \nCicotte/  Thoney 75.00 SOLD\nSpeake / E. Gardner 135.00 SOLD\nShipping is 8.00 for a small flat rate box for 1 or both",
