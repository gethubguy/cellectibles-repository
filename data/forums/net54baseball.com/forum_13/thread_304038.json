      "post_content": "This is a very solid 4, and certainly better than any of the PSA 4 examples of Cobb that have sold recently - in the past six months - for as much as $14000+ on eBay. No creases, stains, or scuffs; clean front and back with decent centering on both sides. Asking net $12000 shipped, PayPal preferred.\n\nSuccessful transactions with: Sean1125, 39special, Ericc22, asoriano, Econteachert205, oldcardboard, tolstoi, Jobu, simas7173, espomario, jmb, Charlie Faust III, Paul S, quitcrab, avalanche2006, Beatles Guy, Banjo, tjenkins, botn, trdcrdkid, jtschantz, longstreet766, greenmonster66, edjs, jb67, rhotchkiss, Puckettfan, mybuddyinc, frankbmd, Baseball*Collections, btcarfagno, Luke, vintageonlybb, bigfish, t206collector, marvymelvin, benginino9, bigedmachine, Stampsfan, Moonlight Graham, Rebublicaninmass, Gradedcardman, Tigerden, Smanzari, t206kid, clydepepper, Scott L., Brian Van Horn, t206whiteborder, polakoff, GoCubsGo32, Hxcmilkshake, Scott Garner, Goudey77, rdixon1208, Pat R, Bram99, bks14sr, Haybag, charlietheexterminator, fusorcruiser, Mutton Chap Yaz, ncinin, rootsearcher60, GoldenAge50s, thecomebacker, Kryksir, T206.org, seattlebaseball, banksfan14, slantycouch, forceplay sport, niembre, nickers, Kris19, bounce, aloondilana, lrush, fusorcruiser, cardsagain74, aronbenabe, JollyElm, Charger74, Cooper1972, ainmon, Gorditadogg, AWGreen, chadeast, ahumes13, dhicks67, mikemcgrail, DHogan, chrisn28, Frankish, bigfish, Donscards, hcv123",
