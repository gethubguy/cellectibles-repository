      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI am looking to collect some T-206s for my personal collection. \n\nI am interested in lower graded ones or raw in fair-vg shape. Included, I am seeking out a HOFer, and would love a Chief.\n\nI'm not looking for $400, $1000, $3000, $5000, $10,000 cards. I cannot afford them.\n\nIf you are interested in helping me build a collection of these incredible cards, reach out. I can spend something weekly if you have a bunch you are looking to sell that won't break the bank.\n\nThank you everyone!",
