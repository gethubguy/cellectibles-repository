As you can see in the scans, there are glue stains and paper loss on the back of this Cobb.\n\nSold net to me, delivered, with PayPal preferred.  \n\nI have other T205s available as well, please let me know if you are interested.\n\nPlease email me at [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with any questions.  Thanks!",
