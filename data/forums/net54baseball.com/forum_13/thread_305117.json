As you can see in the scans, there are glue stains on most and paper loss on some.\n\nShipping is $4, unless you spend $100 total, then it is free.  Prices are net to me, with PayPal preferred.\n\nPlease email me at [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with any questions. Thanks!\n\nCamnitz sold\nMiller sold\nClarke SOLD\nBresnahan SOLD\nHauser sold\nSummers sold\nTitus sold\nCriger sold\nStreet sold\nGardner sold\nDoyle sold\nsold",
