      "post_content": "THE CARDS FOR SALE BELOW ARE TRIMMED\n\nThese are from a scrapbook rescue project. I soaked the cards in distilled water ONLY to remove them from the pages and dried them between non-bleached paper towels. As you can see in the scans, there are glue stains on most and paper loss on some.  All of the cards in this lot were trimmed many years ago prior to pasting them into the album.\n\nShipping is $4, unless you spend $100 total, then it is free. Prices are net to me, with PayPal preferred.\n\nPlease email me at [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with any questions. Thanks!\n\nByrne SOLD\nOlmstead SOLD\nSweeney SOLD\nWallace SOLD\nMaddox SOLD\nBell SOLD\nBates SOLD\nBeck SOLD\nPhelps SOLD\nPhillippe SOLD\nDooin SOLD\nEvans SOLD",
