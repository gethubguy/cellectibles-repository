      "post_content": "Offered here are 3 ungraded 1913 T200 Fatima Team Cards. \nThe Pittsburgh Card has a very nice dark image on the front with good contrast and clarity. Wagner's image is unobstructed . There is a slight crease which is more of a photo crack through Hendrix next to Wagner which does not go through to the back. The back has some black staining which is also present on the front border. I am not sure how this would grade. Possibly an A because of the staining or maybe higher. I can only say it is authentic.\n\nThe Cincinnati card with Joe Tinker has a great front with no visible creases I can see with excellent contrast and clarity. On the back there is a small piece of paper loss in the bottom border likely from album removal and a second small piece of paper loss over the word name\n\nThe Boston AL card is quite nice with a crisp and clean image with great clarity. There is a crease next to Carrigan top to bottom which is apparent on the back as well It does not touch Joe Wood or Tris Speaker in this nice example . The back is mostly clean.\n\nAll 3 are authentic Fatima T200 cards. I cannot say they will grade higher than authentic although I have no way to know how a TPG would judge these three. Thanks for looking\n\nPittsburgh $sold\nBoston AL $sold\nCin           $sold\n\nPlease add 8.00 for shipping in a flat rate box. Paypal f & f preferred",
