      "post_content": "Offered here are two very nice S74 silks. One is an elusive and tough Hall of famer Speaker in a nice Bronze color with red ink and a hint of fraying which doesnt impact the Turkey Red ad the bottom or the factory designation on top  The other is a white silk of Bender with an Old Mill back. The Bender  is quite nice with the factory fold and not much else wrong. Both are very nice. Please add 8.00 for a usps flat rate box\nSpeaker sold\nBender sold",
