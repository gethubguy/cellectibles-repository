      "post_content": "Offered here is a nice T201 Double Folder of Lord and Dougherty. For years the standard catalogue showed this common as one that received a premium and I still believe it is tougher than many . This one is an SGC 2.5 with great color, clarity and centering. There is some obvious wear and use around the fold , rounded corners and light staining on the back which is only somewhat visible in the scan. Photos or a scan on a 3 in 1 printer do not do graded cards justice as this one crisp and clear . \nSOLD",
