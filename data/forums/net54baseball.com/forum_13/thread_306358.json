I may hold onto to these and frame them but if anyone has been looking to acquire them definitely willing to talk. It\u2019s either these or e93s - I wish I could do both but wife might not appreciate that. Thanks so much! Email me if interested in pics etc. Jim \n\n[url]jimmynonkes@yahoo.com[/url]",
