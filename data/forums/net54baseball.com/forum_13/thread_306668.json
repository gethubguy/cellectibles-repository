      "post_content": "Hi folks,\n\nI was an underbidder on the big lot of T209s in the REA auction (lot 261). If you're the winner, I need about 15 cards and would be happy to try to make you a very strong offer on them! (I also know and can put you in touch with a few others on this board who were thinking about that lot in case you're looking to move some of the cards.)\n\nThanks,\nSeth Bernard \n\nsethgbernard @ gmail.com",
