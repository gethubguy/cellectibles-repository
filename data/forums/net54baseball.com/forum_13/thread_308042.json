      "post_content": "Hi all, \n\nContinuing to clear out some stuff as I make room for new projects. Offering up 22 cards from the famed T218 Champions set (153 cards total in the checklist)\n\n21 of the 22 cards have a Mecca back, the other is a Hassan back. All cards are scanned below (apologies, the scans aren't the prettiest, I went for speed here) and this lot includes the James Jeffries full length variation, a very nice card.\n\nMost of the cards are GD+/VG+, a few have some small paper loss on the back or corner creases. Almost all of the cards are very nicely centered and have excellent eye appeal. If you'd like bigger scans, just PM me and I will do my best\n\n* SOLD *",
