      "post_content": "Hello All!\n\nAvailablle for your consideration is this T205 Snodgrass \u2013 Sovereign Reverse with the Lesser Known \u201cNO DECIMAL POINT BEFORE 405\u201d Variation.  (NOTE:  The card with the Hassan reverse is NOT included, but helps show the variations.  I know that you knew that!)\n\nOk, ok, it\u2019s a \u201cSUBTLE\u201d variation, but if the \u201cMathewson Cycle Reverse with 1 Win\u201d Variation counts, then this one should too!\n\nAnyway, here it is.  In MY opinion, it\u2019s in GOOD condition with a FAINT crease under Fred\u2019s nose.\n\nIn my opinion, it measures correctly for the issue and has not been trimmed or \u201cdoctored\u201d in any way!\n\nPlease message me if you are interested.  \"A commitment to buy takes precedence over ongoing negotiations.\u201d  (I stole that phraseology from someone, but I DO like it!)\n\n$95.00, delivered, PayPal \u2013 Friends or Family OR \u201cRegular\u201d PayPal + 3%!\n\nThank you for your consideration!",
