Let me know if you have anything to trade, and maybe we can work something out.  The scans aren't great, but the best my scanner does.  Maybe my phone will do better, if you're interested.\n\nCheers,\nGeno\n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51781649989_fbc71f64e7_h.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51781650009_b16d3634b2_h.jpg[/img]",
