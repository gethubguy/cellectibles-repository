Please DM or email me at [url]afinke3426@aol.com[/url] (or text at 202-321-7495) for additional photos etc.\n\nT200 Cleveland SGC 3 - SOLD\n\nT200 NY National SGC 3 - SOLD\n\nBoth cards exhibit good centering and bold images with sharp contrast. Both have some cracks in the photo paper, typical of the issue, that do not show up in the scans. I can provide additional photos if requested.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220104/2bc3f8c9957639b85b2be89d11224bdc.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220104/5eb39dd209d1c7d64201b3f06e9f3241.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220104/eee2be66bb7a484f15c25e41f3432803.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220104/b95f348d18293c20a30a7dd480b88ee8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
