      "post_content": "For your consideration is this ca. 1908 L40 Leather Chicago University Yell, $20.00, shipped, PayPal Friends & Family, please.\n\nThis one features the University\u2019s Yell or Cheer inside a heavily-gilded border along with a Pennant, Baseball Player, and Track Athlete.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know, these were issued by the American Tobacco Company of Richmond Virginia and New York, as a Premium in Mogul, Fatima, Piedmont, and Murad Cigarettes and Tobacco in 1908.  It measures ~ 3 \u00bd\u201d by ~2 \u215d\u201d.\n\nIt is in EXCELLENT or BETTER condition with virtually all of its Original Gold Leaf being intact.\n\nAlthough it is a college piece, I think that it would easy display in a pre-War or Chicago Cubs or Chicago White Sox collection.  Please decide if it is nice enough for YOUR collection!\n\n\"A commitment to buy takes precedence over ongoing negotiations\"",
