      "post_content": "Hey all \u2013 breaking up my T201s (29 of the 50 from the set) to fund a couple of purchases.  All PSA graded.  This is from a set I put together mostly 10-15 years ago, so these are older holders (hence no \u00bd grades \u2013 most of these were graded before they had the \u00bd grades).  I\u2019m adding some scans and photos here, but can scan and send you any others you want to see better as well \u2013 just let me know\u2026.\n\nPrices are net \u2013 prefer PayPal F/F, Venmo, etc.  but happy to figure out whatever payment works best for you.  Under $100, please add $5 shipping, more and the shipping is on me.  SOLD will trump any negotiations. \n\nThanks for looking!\nScott \n\n2/18 UPDATE: REMOVING SOLD CARDS FROM LISTING HERE, THOUGH THEY MAY APPEAR IN PHOTOS STILL.
