If I don't sell it here, it'll go to SGC and then probably to an AH.\n\nJack Lelivelt is one of the extreme rarities of the T222 set. SGC and PSA together have only graded 9 copies, which is fewer than any other card in the set (even one fewer than the legendary John Henry).  \n\nMine is decent-looking but has some wrinkles like many T222s.  I'm not guaranteeing it hasn't been trimmed, although it measures and looks unaltered (obviously I do guarantee authenticity). I figure anybody who wants one will be glad to have it either way. \n\nVCP lists only one sale of this card in 15 years, from 2007.  An SGC 40 went for $3046.\n\n_________________\n\nthe Jimmy Austin, also a short print but not in the same league as Lelivelt, is about Fair -  $500 OBO",
