Of course, if they did, the price would be a heck of a lot higher (LOL). The price is SOLD delivered PayPal no fees. Thanks for having a look at my sale.\n\nJoe K\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=500810&d=1643868939[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=500811&d=1643868948[/IMG]",
