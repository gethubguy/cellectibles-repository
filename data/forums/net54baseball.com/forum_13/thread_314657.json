It has some light staining and fraying but a great image, decent centering and bold brown printing. Parent has the more interesting AL player design with bats, a glove and catcher's mask present. It has deep blue printing and presents very nicely. Both Sold\nMarquard 59.00\nParent 29.00\n\nPrices net to me with 5.00 for shipping and tracking",
