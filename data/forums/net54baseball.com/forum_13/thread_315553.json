Ideal cards have clean fronts (VG-VG/EX eye appeal with nice registration) though technical grade isn't so important. I do ask that they have no creases or pinholes, though. Staining, paper loss, etc. are ok on the backs. Raw is fine. Thanks for looking.\n\nMy email is bringtherock at gmail.\n\nBender\nCarrigan\nDoolan\nElberfeld\nEvers\nGroom\nKeeler\nKling\nLennox\nLord\nMerkle\nSchulte\nWallace\nWilson\nClose Play at 2nd\nMyers at Bat",
