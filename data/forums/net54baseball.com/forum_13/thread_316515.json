      "post_content": "T202 Hassan Lot of (3) Center Panels\n\nIncludes:\n\n#1. \"Lord Catches His Man\" with the much debated sliding Joe Jackson - Is it really him? I'm just the messenger, man! ;)\n\n#2. Ty Cobb Steals Third - The iconic shot of Cobb blowing up the 3rd base bag.\n\n#3. \"A Desperate Slide For Third\" - Identified as Cobb sliding into Jimmy Austin of the Browns. What may be the neatest thing about this card, is that there's actually a reference to Joe Jackson on the back, and Cobb himself teaching him how to slide.\n\nCondition as shown in the scans. If you need bigger scans, let me know and I'll e-mail them to you. The Lord/Jackson is the nicest one. The iconic Cobb is the roughest. Presentable on the front, pretty bad on the back.\n\nSOLD (Shipped in the U.S.) for the set of (3) \n\nPay almost any way you like.\n\nPM to reserve or e-mail me at David at Boxingtreasures dot com\n\nThanks.",
