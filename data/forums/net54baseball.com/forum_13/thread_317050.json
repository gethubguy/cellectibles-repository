Appreciate any help.[/QUOTE]\n\nJust buy graded cards and save yourself, and all of us, the hassle of hearing the mistakes to be made on this fruitless endeavor. What does your set consist of? What grades are you after? What grader do you prefer? What is most important to you when buying the cards? Who are the players you need or want? Are certain variations needed and what condition is acceptable for those?  All this info is needed for what your asking. Waste of a post IMO!",

      "post_content": "Thanks for chiming in! What a great guy! \nA) the contents of my set are inconsequential \nB) not specifying on condition should be a clue that it doesn\u2019t Matter\nC) what grader I use is pointless to the seller. Much like my favorite color \nD) see C. Nothing to do with asking what raw are for sale. Mostly helpful sellers that aren\u2019t snarky to me for no reason at all. \nE) Only 45 cards In so most cards I need. I\u2019m not making a checklist. It\u2019s much easier to see what people have. I\u2019ve done this fruitless endeavor for over 30 years on many sets. \nF) Waste of a reply IMO. Added nothing of value except showing everybody else who not to deal with. \n\nTo the 3 guys who understood my post without having to break it down to 1st grade reading level.. thank you for the messages. You have made this a fruitful endeavor.",
