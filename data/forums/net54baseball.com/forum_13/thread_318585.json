      "post_content": "Here is a real oddity.  This is a Series 8 miscut of Alabama sport HOFer, Del Pratt.  In addition to a decent baseball career, the second baseman was a star player for the Crimson Tide.  He is pictured as a member of the Montgomery Climbers.\n\nThe card is miscut in a way that it shows an entirely white panel above the orange border.  This is exceedingly rare.\n\n$SOLD postpaid in the continental U.S.\n\n[url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]",
