If anyone has any S74-1 White Silks with the original ad backs of the following player's Barry, Criger, Dygert, Krause, Smith Rustlers and Wallace I would be very interested in acquiring. I have most of the others but am interested in certain ink back combos so if you have any of the 6 I mentioned or others for sale or trade let me know\nThanks in advance",
