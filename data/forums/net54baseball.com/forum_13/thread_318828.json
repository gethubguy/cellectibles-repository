Here's an opportunity to purchase one for much less for this Plow Boy of Bruno Block, White Sox.  It has pinholes in 3 corners and larger tack holes at the top and bottom.  The player image and the back are clean.\n \nYou can PM me here or respond below if interested.  I'll ship it via Priority Mail.    Thanks.\n\n\n[IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/plow_boy_block.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/plow_boy_block_back.jpg[/IMG]",
