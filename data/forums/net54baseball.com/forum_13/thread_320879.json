      "post_content": "Good morning all: \n\nI just got this T213 Coupon (Type 2 Back) Walter Johnson as part of a trade with another board member and am offering it up here before sending to eBay. It as visible flaws, but the blue is vibrant and the registration is great.\n\nOrder of magnitude on scarcity here, PSA has graded 22 of these and 1018(!) of the T206 using the same image.\n\nSOLD.\n\nWould also consider trades or trades + cash. In particular I'm looking for a few different T206 HOFers right now, most of all Mathewson (Portrait), Lajoie (Portrait), Speaker and Walsh, though I have some other needs as well.\n\nStrangely, the image shows for me perfectly when I view this post, but apparently not everyone.
