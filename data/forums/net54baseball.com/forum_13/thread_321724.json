The only other things I might trade it for are 1924 Diaz Cigs HOFers, T206 rare back HOFers (Brown Hindu and tougher), T207 Napoleon back HOFers, e107 HOFers",

      "post_content": "Awesome card, Luke. I was the underbidder, and thought you were the consignor. I have 2 raw ones. One is better, and one is very poor.\n\nT213-1 was my main focus for 2 decades, but they don't ever come up for sale anymore. Like that Kink's song, or the great Van Halen cover, \"Where have all the good times gone?\"",

I figured even though I already have Bender, maybe someday I can trade it for one of the other 7 HOFers in the set.\n\nHere is Mr. Bender in a fresh new holder.  Still looking.",
