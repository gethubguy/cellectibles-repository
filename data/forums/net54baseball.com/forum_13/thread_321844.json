I thought I already had one lined up, but that didn't work out.\n\nTechnical grade not important. Centering and registration are top priorities. Would like to avoid major creases if possible. Honest corner wear not a problem either. I know I'm looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack, but figured I'd give it a go.\n\nThanks in advance.",
