      "post_content": "Offered here are two B18 blankets with Yellow Pennants. One is Graney which over the years I found to be a tough blanket to find. The other is Bassler. The Graney is nice with excellent registration and color with 4 nice brown borders. It has a few light stains on the front. The Bassler was nicer but today when I was taking these pictures a drop of water fell on the purple base path and before I knew it the purple had spread a tad into the white infield \nGraney sold\nBassler sold\nNet prices plus 5.00 handling. Open to offers on both or the other lot of 7 I have posted",
