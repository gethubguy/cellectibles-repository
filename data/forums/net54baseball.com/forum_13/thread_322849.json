      "post_content": "I know it's a long shot BUT I would love to sell these in one or possibly 2 groups.  I have the complete T209-1 set (great overall eye appeal ... all graded) + I have 55 of the North Carolina T209-2 cards out of 114 (in various grades - all graded). \n\nThe T209-1 complete set comes out to a little over $4,000 conservatively.\nThe T209-2 cards includes an PSA 2 of \"Uncle Sam\" BE Thompson and totaled out each card the value is approx  $16,600 conservatively. \n\nI would sell both for $17,500 or the complete T209-1 set for $3,500 SOLD and the 54 T209-2's for $14,500.  \n\nI'm not interested in selling individual cards at the moment. Please don't ask.  Too many cards to post photos of here but I am happy to send any photos you would like to see. \n\nOn a side note, if this doesn't pan out,  I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on the best auction house to send these to if I go that path. I'm concerned about selling all of them individually at once because I imagine the values for all would be rather low. Thanks Dave",
