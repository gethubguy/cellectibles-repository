      "post_content": "Here\u2019s your chance to get a playing era card of the Babe without having to sell a kidney.\n\nThis 1929 WA & AC Churchman card is crease free with some minor soiling and corner rounding. I guess this would grade as a 2 or 3 if you want to get it entombed.\n\nAlso included is a nice classic R.H. Palenske image of the Babe on leather. This seems to be cut from some kind of notebook or publication. I believe it dates from the 1950s.\n\nSee images below. PM with any questions or requests.\n\nPrice is $OLD\n\nPayPal FF preferred. Shipping and insurance is included in the price.",
