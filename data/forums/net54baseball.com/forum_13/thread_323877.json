      "post_content": "Hello all you PCL collectors - \n\nI'm selling 3 SGC-graded T217 Mono Cigarette cards.  These don't appear often, despite Andy Cook's prayers.   Payment can be by PP (please note: not F&F unless we already know each other) or check, your choice. All prices are postpaid. You can respond below and/or by PM.  First come, first served, etc. \n\nUnlike  Jim Manos, I have an operational scanner.  C'mon, Jim!\n\n Thanks - Bill\n\nR. Peckinpaugh, Portland (SGC 10 with creases).  A card hobby hero Val Kehl used to want, badly.  He got his, now you can have one, too.  Has sold for much more in the past.  $900\n\nChadbourne, Portland (SGC 50, high grade for this issue).  $850\n\nKitty Knight, Oakland (SGC 30.  Woulda been a 50 or 60 but for a small paper pull on his right leg, our left).  Despite being called Kitty, he was ornery.  $675\n\nElmer Criger, LA (SGC 10, way too harsh of a grade).  An even worse hitter than his brother, Lou.  SOLD\n\n\n[IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_r.peckinpaugh_sgc10-1.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_r.peckinpaugh_sgc10_back-1.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_chadbourne_sgc50.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_chadbourne_sgc50_back.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_knight_sgc30.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_knight_sgc30_back.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_elmer.criger_sgc1.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]https://thetraderspeaks.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/t217_elmer.criger_sgc1_back.jpg[/IMG]",
