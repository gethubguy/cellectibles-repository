Some say this and the \u201814 CJ are his rookie cards, other say National game and Exhibits are\u2026..arguments made for both sides.\n\nCard is graded Auth because the back is completely covered with scrapbook paper and was likely trimmed as part of the removal. Card is creased but image is strong. Check the comps and you\u2019ll see the prices of him have really boomed with 1\u2019s going over 2k.\n\nI\u2019m asking $[STRIKE]850 $750 [/STRIKE]  $650 shipped with tracking. Can provide references\u2026..\n\nAvailable via PM to discuss.\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2nH9EeR][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52317850539_d2fe5235be_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2nH97CP][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52317744223_8c1e70fb66_b.jpg[/img][/url][STRIKE][/STRIKE][STRIKE][/STRIKE]",
