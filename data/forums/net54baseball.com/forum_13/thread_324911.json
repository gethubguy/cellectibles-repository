      "post_content": "**Card is Sold **\n\nTried the trade route but couldn\u2019t quite find the right match so am now offering this beautiful T202 Tinkers, Evers, Chance graded SGC 5 with great centering, incredible registration (such great focused images compared to many other versions of the card) and a super clean back.  Borders are exceptionally white\u2026 overall, not sure you\u2019ll find a 5 like this available for sale.\n\nIn fact, as you can see from VCP sales history, this card doesn\u2019t have a ton of sale volume - and it\u2019s just so cool!  3 HOFers on one card, the legendary double play combo and even displayed in the right order.  I love this card!\n\nBut I will be \u201cdowngrading\u201d to a lower quality version \ud83d\ude22 to help generate funds for other PC needs.  As I\u2019ve mentioned to many others here, I am 98% collector, 2% seller!  \n\nFinally, yes this is above comps but I have already received offers well above comp and I believe this is just an exceptional card\u2026 looks way nicer than the technical grade.\n\nAsking $sold plus 3% for PPG&S unless we\u2019ve done deals together and you\u2019re comfortable with F&F.  I have lots of references.\n\nThx for looking -\n\nJeff",
