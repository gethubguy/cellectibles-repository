I do have some cards that could use some upgrades, but given the listed condition of this lot, they would only be eye appeal upgrades.\n\nI was not the underbidder either...\n\nCheers,\nSteve",

Baseball Reference doesn't show that he played for Richmond but he actually did towards the end of the 1915 season after the Yankees released him. \n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=536698&d=1664819411[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=536701&d=1664819433[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=536702&d=1664819453[/IMG]",
