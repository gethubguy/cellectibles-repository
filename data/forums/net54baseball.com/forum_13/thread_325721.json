      "post_content": "For sale is one of the toughest 1912 T207 cards, the Louis Lowdermilk Red Cycle back card. This is the highest graded SGC example and is a Population 1. The only card graded higher by any grading company is a PSA 7 that was graded many years ago and is 75/25 centered side to side and has a tobacco stain on the reverse that is not noted on the flip. This is likely the nicest example of this card that exists.\n\nPrice $20,000 Paypal Goods and Services to cover the buyer with protection or a cashier's check for $19,500.",
