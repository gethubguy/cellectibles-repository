      "post_content": "1910-12 Plow Boy Tobacco cabinet of Ed Reulbach, Chicago Cubs. Very scarce, none graded by PSA and only three by SGC, raw number unknown but far and few between. Has creasing as seen, which is not quite as bad in hand, especially the lower one which blends into the background. The image of Reulbach unaffected by any of the detriments. No pinholes or back damage which is fairly common on these which were often tacked up or glued in a scrapbook.\nNO LONGER AVAILABLE",
