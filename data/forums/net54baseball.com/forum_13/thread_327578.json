      "post_content": "After seeing the results of last night's Rea Auction I have decided to offer a complete T209 Series/Type 1 Contentena Set for sale.  I was fortunate to have purchased this set on net54 from a board member this past summer.\n\nThe set offered here averages 2.40 as compared to the average of the full set of items sold last night which averaged only 1.75.  Additionally, the five most difficult players to obtain (Booles, Lane, Martin, Pope and Sisson ) average a grade of 2.00 for this set as compared to those same players that sold last night at an average of 1.90.   \n\nThe combined hammer price of the cards last night totaled $6450, after the 20% premium, and adding on top of it say 6% sales tax and $50 for shipping it brings the total to over $6850.    \n\nI am offering my set at $old venmo friends or $old pp gs which will include shipping.  Given the superior grade of my set this will be a firm price.  \n\nGrades of the individual players are as follows:\n\nCooper PSA 1\nSisson PSA 1\nFullenwider SGC 3\nBourquise SGC 3\nLane SGC 3\nMcGeehan SGC 2.5\nPope SGC 1.5\nStubbe SGC 2\nCowell SGC 3\nCrockett SGC 3\nBooles SGC 1.5\nWalsh SGC 1.5\nMartin SGC 3\nGilmore SGC 2\nArmstrong SGC 2.5\nHoffman SGC 5\n\nThanks for looking and please message if interested.  I can provide additional pictures if you require them.\n\nNote: I will have to add 6% sales tax to any purchaser residing in NC.",
