Pricing these is a bit more difficult (unlike the T218s) as there are very few comps out there and only a handful have been graded by the major companies. \n\nI may be a bit high in pricing of these, but am certainly willing to consider reasonable offers (especially if you take both). \n\nLooking for $50 on Deshler, $75 for Nicholls.",
