      "post_content": "For Sale is a T202 Mathewson/Meyers/Before the Battle\n\ndressed in a SGC 5 tuxedo\n\ngranted, I am biased...but this is a beautiful card in hand and looks great particularly in the SGC slab.  A \"5\" grade seemed a bit harsh\n\nI apologize for the modest shadows and glare on the pics...I tried to take from a couple of angles to get a good representation.\n\nSOLD\n\nthis is below \"5\" SGC and PSA comps from 2021 for this exact card...and even below comps for the lesser devlin middle panel versions.  an SGC 4 sold for $660 last June...and it wasn't close to this \"5\"\n\nthanks for looking",
