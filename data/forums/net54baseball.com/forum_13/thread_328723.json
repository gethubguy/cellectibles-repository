I received several emails, from 20+ yr member friends, about this guy being a bad actor after that thread was posted. Go do business with him somewhere else.  Too many lies and deceit.

And yes, I agree, he did follow through on most (maybe all) deals and would expect him to on any ongoing ones. But when you said \"politics\" it sounded like the banishment isn't warranted, and it is. I am not saying he is a bad guy, just not a fit for this forum. Carry on.. :)\nl",
