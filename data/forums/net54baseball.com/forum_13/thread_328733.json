      "post_content": "Group of 13 T222 Fatima player cards including a PSA graded Chanc. All cards have an \u201cO.L. Felger\u201d backstamp at the top. Several of these are really nice. Was considering sending some in for grading, but figured I\u2019d offer them here first.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot to go on for comps, so if my pricing is off, just let me know.\n\nPrice includes tracked shipping. Will consider offers, especially if buying more than 1. However anyone saying \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d gets priority. To\n\nThanks for looking!\n\n$SOLD Chance PSA 4mk\n$SOLD Archer CUBS with cool catcher gear\n$SOLD Barry\n$SOLD Bush\n$SOLD Fletcher\n$SOLD McInnis\n$SOLD Murphy\n$SOLD Murray[STRIKE][/STRIKE]\n$SOLD Oldring\n$SOLD Orr\n$SOLD Sallee\n$SOLD Wingo\n$SOLD Zimmerman CUBS\n\n\n\n\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4U1mm][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52552637932_aa415e4207_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4XSTE][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553393284_e22a77500b_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4YMN8][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553571255_0ff9b0f417_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4Z8uW][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553637538_83b0f1cf3a_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4U1ok][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52552638047_02f956a77b_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4YML4][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553571135_72f86760df_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4U1oL][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52552638072_b5ff5451e9_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4WnYE][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553100906_23393d8846_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4WnYz][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553100901_5f61c98a2a_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4Z8xb][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553637668_c9b1622f20_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4YMKY][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52553571130_393a9f7b1c_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4U1m1][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52552637912_a780f3b2e1_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2o4U1oR][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/52552638077_720be9fbd4_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
