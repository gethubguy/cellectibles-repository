      "post_content": "For sale is a 1912 T207 Ted Easterly card that has been graded PSA 5. \n\nThe Easterly card is a very low pop at just 24 copies graded by PSA. There are only 2 graded higher than this example.\n\nLatest comp was an REA Auction on 11/13/22 for a PSA 4 that sold for $570.\n\nI'm offering this one on Net 54 for $475 PPFF shipped.\n\nBoth this card and the PSA 4 that recently sold are older PSA holders so the grading for both cards should be relative to each other at the time graded with this example being the better example.\n\nI will be listing (6) different graded Broadleaf backs and (6) different Red Cycle backs over the next day or so.",
