      "post_content": "I am biased, but I think a pretty fantastic card.  The registration is maybe the best I have seen on the card's front.  Black Backed Fact 649 reverse.  Last time I checked there were 14 or these in the pop report with maybe a handful higher.\n\nI took two sets of pics, one on a clear surface, the other on a solid surface to get better contrast.  Happy to take more pics if anyone is interested\n\n\nasking $SOLD PP Goods & Services.  I got this card maybe a year ago in a cash and trade combo deal...so I would consider something like that as well\n\nthanks for looking",
