      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nFigured I would try something a little fun to start the new year. In the spirit of buying a spot in a set break, I would like to do a mini 12 card \"lottery\".\n\nHere are the basics,\n\n12 t213-3 cards (11 commons, 1 HOFer)\nPrice per slot is $400 (PP f/f or venmo)\nPrices range all over the place with these cards so some will see this as a bargain, others not so much.\n\nI think the best way to do a draw would be a zoom call but open to other options, I am not the most tech savvy person around. Also happy to have a second person \"in the room\" for those who would recommend/require it. \n\nPlease send me an email if you would like to participate, [url]rgutheil@gmail.com[/url]\n\nIf/when I get 12 slots covered I will ask for payment and will arrange a time for the drawing.\n\nHere is a list of the cards (will send pics {4 of them are on another post} to all who subscribe before we start and finalize):\n\nHoblitzell ~ SGC 20\nMcquillan ~ SGC 40\nMowrey ~ SGC 20\nPaskert ~ SGC 40\nQuinn ~ SGC 30\nThomas ~ SGC 40\nHuggins ~ SGC 40\nDavis ~ SGC 10\nDonovan ~ SGC 50\nDoolan ~ SGC 10\nDoolan bat ~ SGC 30\nDoyle ~ SGC 50\n\nI will update this post with numbers, so far we have 12 open spots.\n\nAny questions, just ask.\n\nThanks ~ Rob",
