      "post_content": "I am helping sell a collection for a friend. . His father left him an amazing collection of cards, with this being the second and third batch of PSA graded cards and what will prove to be many more submissions of cards that get sold. I voluntered to help and use my name, as I have sold on here and elsewhere for years. I have a flawless track record, and work under the same user name on multiple platforms and EBAY. I have every card being posted in hand. I will be the person shipping everything sold via USPS mail with bubble wrap and mailer and potentially boxed based on the value. Let me know what questions you have. All payments need to be via Paypal and will go to directly to the owner of these cards. He will inform me of payment and I will ship and forward you the tracking day, either the same day or following day that payment is made. I have back scans for anyone that needs them. Please ask me, its easy for me to send you a back scan. Furthermore, you can look up the cert# and see scans on the PSA website. All cards have been scanned in there. Please let me know what questions there are. Please add $5 for shipping no matter how many cards you purchase.\n\nT207 Zach Wheat PSA 3 - $SOLD  \n [img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52648490919_13478020da_z.jpg[/img]",
