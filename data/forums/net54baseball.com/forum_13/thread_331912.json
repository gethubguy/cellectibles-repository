      "post_content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have been getting into collecting pre-war cards in the last few years, but specifically my hometown Pirates. I have a few cards now but looking to grow my collection. I am not picky on quality and typically looking on the cheaper side unless something really catches my eye.\n\nI really love T3 Turkey Reds (the only one I have currently is George Gibson), T206 portraits, and a few different caramel card sets. Would love to see what you might have that you're looking to sell!",
