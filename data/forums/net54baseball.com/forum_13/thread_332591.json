      "post_content": "Hello.  Selling a Tris Speaker (Piedmont back) 1911 T205.  SGC 1.5.  Working on posting photos here but until then the card can be viewed on eBay under my handle there japerlm-46.  Here I am asking $465 delivered priority PPGS.  I prefer to do it that way to keep everything above board so no FF please although I would do $450 Bank of America Zelle - btw whenever I hear Zelle I am reminded of former Cardinals player Todd Zeile.  Does this happen to anyone else?   Anyway please feel free to message me and I will send pics or you can email me at (my first name followed by underscore and then my last name at yahoo dot com.  \n\nIn terms of comps, a PSA 1.5 recently sold for $495.  I believe mine has better eye appeal but you be the judge.  \n\nThank you!",
