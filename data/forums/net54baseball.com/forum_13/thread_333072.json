      "post_content": "I have the following copy of the T205 Bobby Wallace without cap (2 lines of stats) card available. It's a really tough card, but as you can tell from the pictures, it is in extremely poor condition, with considerable paper loss and creasing on the front and back. \n\nI'm asking $85 shipped (PPFF). But I am not sure what the market value of the card in this condition is, so I'm certainly open to offers!",
