      "post_content": "Gorgeous T200 Fatima 1913 Pittsburg Pirates Team card - with HOFers Honus Wagner, Max Carey and Fred Clarke.\n\nAs background, I picked up this beauty several months ago as an affordable (relatively speaking) card of the iconic all time great, Honus Wagner.  As a HOF collector, it\u2019s challenging to find a nice Wagner that isn\u2019t priced way out of range \n\nAs a bonus, the horizontal image of the Pirates team, the great Fatima card back and the inclusion of fellow HOFer Fred Clark make this card a great visual in a HOF display. \n\n$1275 delivered \n\nthanks\n\nJeff\n\nJeff",
