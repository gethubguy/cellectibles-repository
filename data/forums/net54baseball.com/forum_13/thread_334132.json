I was looking for something besides shelves for slabs and couldn't find a good solution... so I created this bespoke design for tobacco cards, to let your collection shine instead of being stuck in a book...\nPlease check it out:\n\n [url]www.martimar-cards.com[/url]\n\n.. and feel free to email with questions... I just launched the site last month so everything is on sale... would love any feedback or suggestions...\n\nThanks!\n\nCraig\n\n[url]martimar-cards@hotmail.com[/url]",
