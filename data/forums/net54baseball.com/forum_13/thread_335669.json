Available is the Hoblitzell No Stats PSA 2.5.  \n\nI recently upgraded (although I like the appeal of this one more versus the one I just picked up) and I really don't need 2 of them.\n\nAsking price is $29,000 net of any fees and includes registered mail shipping to you.  Happy to meet up for hand delivery within a few hours of central Ohio as well.  \n\nFeel free to PM with questions.  Partial trades would be considered as well.\n\nthanks!\n\nTroy Rambo",
