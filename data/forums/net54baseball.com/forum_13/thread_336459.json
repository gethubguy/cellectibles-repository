Just curious as T3 is a set I plan to work on some day.\n\nGood luck finding the last few you need![/QUOTE]\n\nSeveral dealers had a couple, and one had about 50, but none I needed. Pre-war set building is usually pretty good at teaching me which cards are actually harder to find than others. I wasn\u2019t expecting to find all 6 I needed, but a couple would have been nice. Oh well. I did grab an upgrade of my Dahlen though. Onward! \ud83d\ude00",
