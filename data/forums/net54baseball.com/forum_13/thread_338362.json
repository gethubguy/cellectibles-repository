However, the liner material doesn't always stay perfectly smooth - they do not consider it a defect and it has no effect on the card itself. The liner was like this when I purchased this at REA ([url]https://bid.robertedwardauctions.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=103039[/url]), and I'm including their scans as well because their equipment/technique allowed them to get a clearer view of the card itself.\n\n[URL=\"https://imgur.com/a/1SJCiSi\"]LINK TO PICTURES[/URL]",
