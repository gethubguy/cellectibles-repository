      "post_content": "Hi - selling this gorgeous T3 John McGraw SGC 40. Light wrinkle top center edge (when oriented as shown below), is really the only issue holding this back from a higher grade.  Otherwise, very nice and clean T3!\n\n$975 delivered.  I can get you better scans later tonight if interested.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
