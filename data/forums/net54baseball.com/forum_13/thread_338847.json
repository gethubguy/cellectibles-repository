PPFF or add 3%\n\nIt's a beautiful card, with no creases, no ink or stamp marks on the back, very clean and centered 50/50 with extremely vibrant colors f/b. \n\nI believe this is the second-highest grade available with great eye appeal. \n\nThe reason for selling this card is because it doesn't fit my low-grade sub-set.\n\nI'd be interested in a possible trade for the following: \n\n1911 t212 obak ten million, Holland Creameries cards, 1953 Topps 244 willie mays or a 1959 Topps Venezuelan Willie Mays.\n\nPlease contact me via PM if interested.
