      "post_content": "Offered here is a T5 Pinkerton Postcard of Hugie Jennings in his popular and classic pose. I have decided not to collect the set and offering this nice example for sale. The item has a very slight amount of creasing which is more obvious on the back and doesn't break through much on the front and slightly rounded corners. The back has some staining possibly from glue or something but is slight and mentioned for accuracy only. This raw card came out of and SGC 20 holder (which seemed like a harsh grade). I cannot guarantee what the grade would be from any TPG only that it is authentic and measures correctly 3 3/8\" x 5 1/2\" \nOffered for sold",
