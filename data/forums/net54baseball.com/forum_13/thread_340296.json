      "post_content": "Offered here are two different 1914 B18 Blankets. One is a very desirable yellow blanket of Slim Sallee. It is excellent condition with 4 full brown borders, excellent color and clarity. It does have some age toning but in my opinion is an exmt blanket\nThe other is a rare overspray error blanket of Sweeney NY AL. While I get and error blanket is not a t206 error I have been collecting B-18 blankets on and off for almost 20 years and have only seen 2 or 3 error blankets. \nSallee sold\nSweeney SOLD\n6.00 for shipping and tracking. Discounts for both Please inquire",
