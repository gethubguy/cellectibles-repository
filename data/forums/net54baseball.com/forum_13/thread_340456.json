He has never been inside of any \u201cplastic prison\u201d and hopefully the new owner will allow him to remain free range. If he is submitted to the guards at PSA or SGC he will probably return to you with a cell number of 5 or higher.\n\nSee images below to help you form your own opinion on condition. PM or post in thread with any questions or requests.\n\nPrice is $OLD\n\nPayPal FF preferred. If PayPal G&S add $10. Shipping and insurance is included.",
