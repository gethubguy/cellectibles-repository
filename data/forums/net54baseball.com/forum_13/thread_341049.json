The back registration is worse than the front. Not a severe error but they missed their mark causing registration issues.  Boones name and the rest of the blanket front is printed nicely and the blanket is clean with great color and 4 nice brown borders.\n\n \n\n\n\n \nPrice is net to me \nBoone       35.00\n\n\nAdd 5.00 for shipping with tracking",
