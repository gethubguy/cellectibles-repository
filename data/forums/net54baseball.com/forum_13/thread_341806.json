There is a crease that runs across the middle of the card. If you would like better pictures, just let me know!\n\n[STRIKE]$500[/STRIKE] Sold delivered. Pm or email at [url]eppersmatt@yahoo.com[/url] with questions or offers. I would also be open to trades for T210's that I don't have, specifically Orange Borders.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=594125&d=1698081029[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=594126&d=1698081034[/IMG]",
