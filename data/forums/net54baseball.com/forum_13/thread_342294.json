      "post_content": "Offered here is a very nice S74-1 Silks with the attached advertising back. The player is Davy Jones of the Detroit Tigers. Davy is a somewhat difficult player to find with the interesting cross bats style of print on the front. This is the style of many of the American League Players which are typically harder to find than NL players. This one has the factory fold/crease otherwise the back and front are clean and nice. It has brown printing. It is always difficult to find the white silks with the ad backed attached increasing the value by 2.5  to 3 times one with the back missing. \nSOLDnet plus 5.99 for shipping with tracking",
