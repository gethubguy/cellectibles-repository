Mattern SGC Authentic\n\nSo a little funny back story on this one.....I cracked this out of some defunct TP grader from days past, clear smaller case/white label.  \n\nIt was graded ET-7.  Showed it to a buddy of mine who immediately said ET stands for trimmed.  I scoffed at this and decided to prove him wrong because I figured it might pull at least a 6 at SGC.    \n\nWelp.....\"So you get what we had here last week -- which is the way he wants it.  Well, he gets it.\"   LOL\n\n$old\n\nThanks for stopping by!",
