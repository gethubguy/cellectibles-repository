Where have you been in the last 15 years with all this information that you\u2019ve collected while everybody else has been doing research and posting it to the board? It\u2019s very odd that I have never done a transaction with you in my 18 years of collecting T205\u2019s. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever got any information from you, yet you claim to have an extremely accurate database based on VCP over the last 15 years. How are you able to track the back of the cards that don\u2019t have pictures of the backs available? This was an issue in the beginning of VCP for years wasn\u2019t it, or was that a different site I\u2019m thinking of?\n\nI\u2019m just curious how you think you can question my integrity. Especially since I go back 15ish years on this board with T205\u2019s alone. I didn\u2019t see a single one of those old-school T205 guys stepping up to take your side. That\u2019s because some of us have shared information with each other for years and years and years. Therefore the information that we put out and give out is accurate. So if I tell you that your numbers are incorrect for Piedmont 42s, you can take it to the bank. I\u2019ve owned more Piedmont 42 backed T205s then you\u2019ve probably owned in T205\u2019s total. The guys on this board got so pissed off when I sold off my collection. I should say partial, but I sold off most of it, and it sank the prices for a couple years. \n\nYour list is similar to the one that\u2019s posted publicly to the board for members to add to a master list. Hell I screwed up and made a few checks in the wrong boxes. Swore I was correct, being cocky and confident of myself of course. Then dove through picture after picture of cards I had owned over a 4-5year span to try and find what I was remembering. Needless to say the card doesn\u2019t exist and I screwed up. I don\u2019t think I ever got defensive and said people are calling my integrity out and then laying my reputation down on something that I\u2019m not sure whether I was 100% right on. We have enough liars and frauds in this hobby that frequent this board already so please don\u2019t add to it.\n\nTo anyone that got their feathers ruffled because I didn\u2019t PM him about this information. Why even comment? I fully understand whose post I posted on. So why are you on here running your mouth to give your two cents about what and how I post. What happened to minding your own business? It\u2019s not your business. It\u2019s not your cards. It\u2019s not your information that was written in the post. It\u2019s not your place to say anything unless you have supporting evidence to prove me wrong, which I know you don\u2019t. \n\nIf there\u2019s an issue, I\u2019ll hear from a moderator.",
