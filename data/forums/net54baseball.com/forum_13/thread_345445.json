      "post_content": "Rob- I believe the provenance on the McGraw overprint is that I originally found it in a large collection of T213-3s in the early 80\"s in what was later called the 'Southern Find.' I was able to put the complete set together all in vg/ex or better condition. There were 8 Overprints, 2 Cobbs, 2 McGraws and I forget the other 4 players in the Find. I sold the complete set to Bill Mastro in around 1985-1990 and kept the two OP Cobbs and one McGraw and had all 3 slabbed by SGC. Sold the McGraw which is I believe is the same card you are selling and sold 1 Cobb OP through Net54 and traded the other for an E94 Wagner in a PSA 5, years ago. \nHope you are doing well.\nTBob",
