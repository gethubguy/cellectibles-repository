      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T212 Obak cards available for sale. All of these cards are obviously very low grade and most have had the borders completely trimmed off.  Still, quite a few are very difficult low population cards and tough to find in any condition.\n\nPlease add $4 shipping (USPS Ground Advantage which includes $100 insurance) for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Prices listed are net to me, via any payment method you prefer.\n\nPlease send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\n\nCARDS PICTURED (removing SOLD cards from list for easier viewing):\n\n1909 (Type 1):\n\n**ALL SOLD**\n\n1910 (Type 2, 150 Series):\n\n**ALL SOLD**\n\n1910 (Type 2, 175 Series):\n\n**ALL SOLD**\n\n1911 (Type 3):\n\n**ALL SOLD**",
