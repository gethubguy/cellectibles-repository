I guess I need to rethink my \u201cforever\u201d tag in my PC!\n\nAm priced a bit aggressively vs some comps due to overall eye appeal - I sometime pay on the higher end of comp range to be sure I get the better quality for the card grade\u2026 am cross posting in several places, FYI.\n\n** $435 plus $10 to ship safely **\n\nNOW $385\u2026",
