He was born in Mellenville, NY and lies in an unmarked grave just a few miles from my home. He batted behind Ty Cobb and held his own for the Tigers. If it wasn't for the yips, he could have been a very special player.\n\nI have a small collection of Sweet Corporal and Piedmont cards, but not many others. \n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\nMatt",
