      "post_content": "Keating is an error/scrap that appears to have come out of the manufacturing process without the green or blue color and slightly burned. I have seen this burn before and have others with the burn that are missing color. Normally Keating would have a green or blue infield with brown pennants. This one is white on the front with maybe a hue of green and the back slightly darker. The brown basepaths look like they are missing a color pass too but are still mostly brown . The dark green is as dark as grass, and this is basically white. The blue even darker which isn't at all a match. Clearly an error or scrap otherwise the players outline would have faded too\n\nKeating 84.99 net\n with 5.99 shipping with tracking",
