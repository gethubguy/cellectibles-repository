Will also happily trade for another beat T206/T206/cheap card\n\nThe card is ALTERED - it is missing a corner and the big stain has altered the stock, thickening the card (not brittle, just thicker).  This card is in very poor condition, as you can see :).  Authenticity is unconditionally and fully guaranteed.",
