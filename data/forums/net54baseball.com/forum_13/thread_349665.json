Presents nicely with a horizontal crease at the bottom third but does not take away from the image.  Stamped back as many Obaks are.  \n\nPending  pp/ff includes priority shipping via the local Best Western Plus (too soon?). \n\n\"I'll take it\" supersedes negotiations.\n\nPlease pm with any questions and thanks for looking.\n\nEdit:  would also consider trade for a clean E100 plus cash.\n-",
