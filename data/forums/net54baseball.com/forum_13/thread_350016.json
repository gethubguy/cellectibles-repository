I will include shipping.  \n\n[STRIKE]harry mcintyre $260[/STRIKE] SOLD\n[STRIKE]fred clarke $400[/STRIKE] SOLD\n[STRIKE]chief bender $650[/STRIKE]SOLD\n\nadded:\nsome one asked me if Bender had \"any issues\".  here is my reply:\nIt does have a pinhole. I think that is probably considered paper loss on the edge near his right elbow. a tiny indentation on the edge near his right ear. looks like some staining maybe on some of the borders. All that stuff can be seen in the scan. Also here is a link to the photos that you may be able to zoom in on. I don't see anything that doesn't show up in the photo.\n[url]https://drive.google.com/drive/folde...Sf?usp=sharing[/url]\n\nNo creases on the Bender.\n\nadded: \nMcIntyre has a pinhole, and a 1/4\" long wrinkle on the bottom thru the R in McIntyre\n\nClark has no pinhole but he does have the wrinkle that starts at the R in Clarke and goes full height, causing some paper loss at his right elbow and actually becomes 3 wrinkles above his right shoulder.",
