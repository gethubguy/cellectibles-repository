      "post_content": "Hello. I have the below pictured T205 Patrick Moran \"Stray Line of Type\" variation for sale.  As you can see from the scans, the card is lower grade overall, with multiple creases and edge/corner wear.  However, it is very well centered with good registration on the face and front image, which are both rare qualities for this particular card.  Scarce in any condition and definitely one of the toughest cards in the set!\n\n**CARD IS SOLD**\n\nPlease send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!",
