      "post_content": "Good afternoon. I am just over 70 cards into this 175 card project. Looking for binder grade 1910 series 2 Obaks. Prefer raw but will take 1\u2019s or 2\u2019s for cracking. If they are on the attached list, I need them. Please feel free to message me if you can help. Thank you in advance for your assistance.",
