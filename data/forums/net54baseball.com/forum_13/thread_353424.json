It's a Series 8, which is interesting because most of the color-variations on the borders seem to be in Series 3.\n\nAsking $325 delivered.\n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=635317&d=1726947013[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=635318&d=1726947021[/IMG]",
