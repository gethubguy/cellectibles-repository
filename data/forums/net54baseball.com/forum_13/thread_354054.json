I\u2019ve been collecting Jake Stahl cards for two decades now and am approaching the end of the journey with only a few cards left. Looking for an E90-1 and three T206 - the Drum, Broadleaf 460, and Tolstoi backs. Condition does not matter, just need these last four cards and I\u2019ll have the collection complete. PM if you have one and are looking to get rid of it or trade. I have a ton of stuff to trade as well. Thank you",
