      "post_content": "Awesome, very rare printing goof tied to the t213-3 set.  I've seen a lot of cards missing color passes.  Very rarely do I see them missing captions like this.  In addition to the missing caption, this card is also missing the \"NY\" logo on Rube's left shoulder.  Awesome oddity that has a real \"scrap\" feel to it as the entire card really looks \"off\".  \n\nThe third image shown below is what this card SHOULD look like.  \n\nAsking $1600 delivered or would consider trades for e107s or n300s.  Thanks all!\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640837&d=1731794165[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640838&d=1731794176[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640839&d=1731794183[/IMG]",
