Definitely a scrap card that came out with bright yellow borders, blank back, color pass shifts and is very much handcut!\n\nI know most people know what a t205 McGraw SHOULD look like, but I included a scan at the bottom just for convenience.\n\nAsking $2100 for this monster scrap card or would consider trades for N300 Mayos or e107s!\n\nThanks!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640861&d=1731817872[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640862&d=1731817880[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640863&d=1731817996[/IMG]",
