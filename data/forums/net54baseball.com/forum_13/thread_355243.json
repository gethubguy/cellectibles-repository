      "post_content": "I've truly never seen a card, prior to this one, where the black ink is actually missing.  Any other color sure....but for this card, because it's missing black, everything in the card that would have had black - caption and even the BORDER of the card included - now is a reddish/pinkish color.\n\nWhat's especially kind of cool here is SGC's slab even designates this as a \"color variation\"\n\nPS....I added a small image at the bottom of what this card SHOULD look like.  Not included in this sale though :)\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640935&d=1731860325[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640936&d=1731860333[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642731&d=1733512695[/IMG]",
