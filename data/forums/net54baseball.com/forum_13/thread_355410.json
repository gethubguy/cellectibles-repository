Nice looking card -  $SOLD\nNOTE: Mogridge is one of the great underestimated rarities in the set.  The last time I did a population survey of T207, which was in 2018, I was surprised to see that overall, there were fewer graded copies of Mogridge than any other card, even Donlin (see below).  \n\n\nSweeney, Doves - Poor - the Front appears VG, back has obvious damage and scrapbook paste residue   $90\n\n\nIn case you're interested, here were the 2018 pops for the 50 Broad Leaf/Cycle/Anon cards (PSA and SGC).  (I should do a new one but it'll probably be January before I can get to it):\n\nMogridge34\nHouser35\nBauman39\nDonlin39\nKuhn39\nAdams40\nBlanding41\nPeters41\nRagan41\nPelty42\nDonnelly43\nFournier44\nLange44\nMiller, Ward44\nButcher45\nWhite45\nBirmingham46\nWorks46\nBushelman47\nMcCarthy47\nRasmussen47\nTyler47\nHyatt48\nRath49\nSweeney49\nWoodburn50\nCunningham52\nDowney52\nRyan52\nLewis, Irv (no emblem)9\nLewis, Irv (not specified)17\nLewis, Irv (emblem)27\nHoff55\nSaier55\nBlackburne57\nHartley57\nMiller, Roy57\nLowdermilk58\nMoore58\nNelson58\nWilson, Owen58\nKirke61\nKelly64\nAlmeida65\nGregg65\nMoriarty66\nPhelan67\nBenz69\nMiller, Otto69\nKutina73\nWeaver81\nHerzog86",
