      "post_content": "I have several 1911 T332 Helmar Stamps duplicates that I would like to sell and/or trade.  I am the proud owner of a complete set of the Helmar baseball stamp series, but could use a handful of upgrades.  The ones shown in the link below are my duplicates.\n\n[url]https://imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras[/url]\n\nReach out if you want to trade or want to buy anything shown here.  Most are lower condition, but there are a few gems in the group, like the Johnny Evers shown below.  I've also included some additional eye candy.  These are all around the same size, but show up as larger or smaller depending on how I crop the scans (i.e., the amount of black space surrounding the stamp).\n\nPM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url].\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras/large/1911%20Evers%20_2_.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras/websize/1911%20Beck%20_2_.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras/websize/1911%20Block.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras/websize/1911%20Griffith%20_2__1.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/baseballstamps/1911helmarstampsextras/websize/1911%20Hoblitzell.jpg[/IMG]",
