      "post_content": "Has a definitive \"hand-cut\" feel with all four borders being wavy and one corner in particular measuring fairly wide/oversized.  Neat blank back which is very seldom seen from this set.  Card is in great condition with no wrinkling or any wear to speak of.  Centering is a bit off....lol\n\nAsking $185 delivered.  Thanks in advance!\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642303&d=1733106070[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642304&d=1733106079[/IMG]",
