This is a handcut card with about the worst cutting job that ever could have existed on a card, but the Wiltse did come out of this with insanely oversized borders. \n\nAlso features a blank back and what looks like a \"hashmark\" of some sorts on the left border indicating it could even be a Proof.\n\nAsking $800 for one or the most severe Scrap / Proof cards to come out of my collection!\n\nThanks!\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642838&d=1733599772[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642839&d=1733599781[/IMG]",
