      "post_content": "Neat card that is in terrific shape and measures long top to bottom.  Part of a different card shows at the very bottom.  Borders are wavy, oversized and clearly handcut off the sheet.\n\nThe back has an odd \"tone\" to it as well.  This is a \"browner\" back than I'm used to see....they're normally perfectly white.\n\nAsking $150 delivered!\n\nThanks!\nBrian\n[url]Redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=643392&d=1733965563[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=643393&d=1733965599[/IMG]",
