      "post_content": "This card occupied the \"C46 spot\" in my oddity collection due to its slight miscut for several years.  Not the biggest printing freak out there, but it's enough that you can see two captions showing on the reverse of the card.  It's probably still the biggest printing goof I've ever seen associated with this set for those that appreciate that sort of thing!\n\nOn a side note, when I was putting my C46 set together, Carlo was one of the final 2-3 cards I came across, making this one of the very toughest in the set, at least for me :)\n\nAsking $40 delivered.  Thanks all!\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]",
