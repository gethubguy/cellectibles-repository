      "post_content": "This has to be the ultimate oddity - the player's actually missing his head!  So yes, we have a t222 \"Headless\" Oldring here.  A while back, I believe we had a thread on the board here about the cause of this goof.  I think that some of the better theories involving this oddity included that chemicals may have removed the head, post-print production.  The card getting too close to an open flame was another good theory.  \n\nThere's a good theory in place that suggests the card could have been a pre-production issue as well. The card having an under developed photograph that made it through the production process was a popular one.  I believe other cards from other sets have shown up that have this issue as well.\n\n** EDIT ** ... Ahhh, I found the thread....here it is in case anyone wants to read about the card a bit further and theories involved - [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=209423&highlight=t222+oldring[/url]\n\nRegardless, it's pretty dang cool!  Asking $60 delivered.  \n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=645036&d=1735325914[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=645037&d=1735325925[/IMG]",
