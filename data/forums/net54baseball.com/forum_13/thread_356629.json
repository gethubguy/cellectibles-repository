      "post_content": "So if memory serves, the reason you occasionally see really foggy / cloudy / hazy t210s like this one is because for the occasional original print production run, the final layer of gloss was omitted and without that protective seal, the card \"fogged up\" over time.\n\nNot the prettiest of printing oddities, but it is a print / production goof nonetheless. Asking $65 delivered.
