These a VERY SCARCE and few in numbers and are called Anonymous Factory Backs. They came from various tobacco companies from Virginia and Louisiana\u2026..this one being Louisiana.\nI\u2019m accepting offers on this card, payment will be by PPFF or PPGS (add 3%) I will pay shipping and insurance in the US.\nAll sales final\nMessage me if interested.\n\n.[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649684&d=1738443719[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649685&d=1738443733[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649686&d=1738443744[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649687&d=1738443762[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649688&d=1738443777[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649689&d=1738443789[/IMG]",

I know it is rare and has value, but I have had to educate myself on this and T207 cards in general ( as I plan to sell my small collection of T207\u2019s and continue to grow my T206 collection).I feel the community here is the most fair and also helpful in situations like this.",

The story and enjoyment of who the player was, etc is worth way more than $125 to me. \nAnd I\u2019m not being flippant or condescending, I actually mean what I wrote above. And the best thing is, even though I\u2019m not collecting T207\u2019s ( never really was , years ago I got this Almeida along with 15 others) , I learned something about the Anonymous Factory back. I\u2019m going to keep my two NY Giants and the Almeida and sell the other 13 shortly.",
