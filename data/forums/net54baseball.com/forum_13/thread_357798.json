It's obviously in poor condition but also obviously an Anonymous back (Louisiana can be made out so it's a fact 3)\n\nI don't see many Recruit class anonymous back to compare to for price. So shoot me a PM if interested and maybe we can work something out.\n\nWill consider trades also, prewar tobacco and caramel. \n\nThanks for looking!\nJeff\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2qJBFEe][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54303510141_b21924f815_c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2qJCUbn][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54303747369_7065e558c3_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
