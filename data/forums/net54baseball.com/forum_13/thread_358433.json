      "post_content": "Hi - selling the following T227's.  Condition is rough on a couple of them, but these are tough cards to find. \n\nShipping is $5 if you buy one, or I'll cover shipping if you buy more than one.  PPFF preferred but happy to accept whatever method is best for you. \n\nAlfred de Oro (billiards) HLC back - SGC 10 - $sold\nSheppard (track & field) Miners back - SGC 20 - $35\nHilton (golf) Miners back - PSA 1 - $45\nHoppe (billiards) Miners back - PSA 1 - $45\n\nOr take the remaining 3 for a net $110 total.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
