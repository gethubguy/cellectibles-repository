I'll will also include a link to my Google drive featuring all my trade fodder, which has mostly baseball, vintage to some modern (please let me know if the link isn't working).\n\nMy \"high-priority\" list would include: Bob Gibson RC, 1955 Topps Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, and I have a few of the 1959 Fleer Ted Williams left to finish the set. I do very limited modern, but would be interested in the 2013 Topps Boston Strong cards.\n\nT205 Trade Fodder\nEd Karger - Piedmont: SGC 2.5\nJohn Kleinow - Hassan: SGC 2\nCharles Wagner - Cycle: SGC 1.5\n\nHere's a link to my folder: [url]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S3TMsXjuV6GI7qpL3FfdxMsYYaw1_KTQ?usp=drive_link[/url]",
