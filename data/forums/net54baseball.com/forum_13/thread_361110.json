I actually like this card? quite a bit, as it features a nice image of the great Tris Speaker and the back is also pretty compelling.  My main reason for selling is that I have OCD about large slabs and don't like the way it fits in storage.  Thank you.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/dXJfbkL.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/kWWE0l2.jpg[/img]",
