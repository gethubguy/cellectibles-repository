I am looking for PSA or SGC graded examples.\n\nAlexander - Thanks to a fellow Board member for helping to find his Grover Alexander a new home\nAustin - knocked this one off my list as well.\n\nOnly three more to go to complete my set....\n\nHuggins (yes, I know there is one on Ebay)\nKeating\nSchulte\n\nI am hoping that somebody can help me whittle down this list even more. I have a lot of T222 trading fodder (including several short print cards) as well as some 1914 Cracker Jacks that may be of interest. I am also happy to pay cash. \n\nPlease let me know if you can help....",

I'm aware of the ones on Ebay, but looking for something a little nicer than being in two pieces or missing chunks.  \n\nI know you said you were looking for PSA/SGC examples, but I do have an extra raw Keating.  It's in bad shape (missing a chunk), but if you want it let me know and we'll figure something out.\n\nGood luck on the rest, especially Schulte!",
