      "post_content": "I'm looking to trade this T222 SP card of WaJo for/toward 1916, 1917 and/or 1921-22 card(s) of WaJo with scarce advertising backs. If it wasn't for the clipped corner, this would be a very nice T222 card. I am willing to consider a \"deferred trade\" whereby you will acquire card(s) to trade me in the near future. I got this card recently slabbed by SGC, and here are both before and after pics. I'm sorry for the mis-oriented pics of the slabbed card; these pics are correctly oriented when I open them on my PC.",
