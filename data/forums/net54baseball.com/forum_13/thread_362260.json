The back is not only cut wrong but also printed upside down!\n\nHave seen major miscut (Cartwright) sell at auction for $529 (see attached)...\n\nAsking $670 o.b.o..../negotiable, or open to trade ideas.... please PM or email with questions.  Thanks!\n\nCraig Martin\n[url]C.martin@spirearch.com[/url]",
