      "post_content": "Offered here is a very nice example of a S74 colored silk of Harry Wolter of the New York Yankees. This is a green color silk with bold red printing and the more interesting design with crossed bats, mitt, balls and catcher's mask. This one has minimal fraying, great registration and excellent centering. It is an SGC 3. A smallish stain upper back is what keeps this silk from being a 5 or 6\n139.99 plus 5.99 shipping with tracking net to me",
