Centering is pretty good. The O'Leary has a stain on the back.\n$75.00 for all three. $3.00 to ship. Paypal, check or money order.\n\nDonohue and Spencer are sold. O'Leary still available $25.00.\n\n[IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/3T206VG.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/T206VGback.jpg[/IMG]\n\nFirst email saying I'll take them--gets them.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJoe",
