I am looking for collector grade T206 in return trade.  Generally looking for presentable fronts, damaged backs OK. E-mail dsh46@aol.com\n\nREULBACH NOW ON HOLD (10:30 AM 11/20) AND THE 41 PLAYBALL IS SPOKEN FOR.\n\nI was going to send this for grading but figured I'd see what happens on BST first:\n\n[IMG]http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p280/dsh46/reulbachfrontt205.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p280/dsh46/reulbahbackt205.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThese are generally in poorer shape, except for Indian Bob and the W514. The W514 has some light creasing in the upper left background.  Fatima and Coupon backs are shown.  Unscanned backs are: T202 endpiece (Hassan), T205 Sheckard (Polar Bear), T205 Doyle (Hassan), T207 Smith (Recruit 240).  The Smith is miscut and shows border of the name frame of the card above it. \n\n[IMG]http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p280/dsh46/prewarpotpourri.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p280/dsh46/backs.jpg[/IMG]",
