Postally used in 1897, this envelope has on the reverse, in deep red print, an enormous El Principe de Gales advertisement. You practically need sunglasses to look at it. It's absolutely perfect to display with an El Principe de Gales-backed T206. $125 or best offer.\n\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/epdg1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/epdg2.jpg[/IMG]",
