      "post_content": "Posted By: James Feagin\nUp for sale is the following. All cards have clean backs with no back damage. These cards are paypal only and are first come first serve through e-mail. Since I'm finally becoming a more focused collector, I will ONLY consider cards for trade from the following sets 1933 Tattoo Orbit, 1933 DeLong, 1933 Buttercream, 1933 Uncle Jack's, 1933 George C. Miller. I typically am only trading for Hall of Famers, except for Tattoo Orbit, I'm doing that set. Delivery confirmation is included, but insurance is extra.\nHave fun!\n\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/t201wheatauto.jpg[/IMG]--$550\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/t3turkeyredbaker.jpg[/IMG]--$575\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/1914t213lajoie.jpg[/IMG]--$275\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/t213-2.jpg[/IMG]---Chance $225, Bresnahan (Toledo)---$175\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/lindstrom.jpg[/IMG]--$150 (Lionel Carter Collection)",
