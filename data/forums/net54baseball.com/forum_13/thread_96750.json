      "post_content": "Posted By: T206Collector\nAuthenticating a print signature is the same as authenticating a script signature.  It is a handwriting analysis.  Meyers signed his name in a variety of ways over his life.  Sometimes he referred to himself as Chief -- as he does here.  Other times he referrred to himself as John.  \n\nEdited to add that I spoke with JSA today about how they authenticated these signatures.  It was explained to me that they have numerous examples of Meyers' signature, primarily on 3x5 index cards, and he routinely signed in print as on these cards.  \n\nEdited again to add that they will be listed on ebay.",
