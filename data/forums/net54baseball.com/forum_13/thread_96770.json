      "post_content": "Posted By: Mark T\nVery, very tough card from the T204 Ramly set....out of 21 cards graded by both SGC/PSA there is nothing higher than a PSA 5...SGC has 5 cards graded a 40(3) and nothing higher. This card has NO creases or wrinkles. I believe the corners are the reason for the grade. Back has some light staining, overall its a beautiful card. I believe this to be one of his Rookie cards.\n\nEmail me at:   vintagecards@gmail.com\n\n\n$1,150 delivered and insured by what ever way you would like to pay.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/350_t204cicolte001.jpg[/IMG]?t=1196161689\n\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/350_t204cicolteback.jpg[/IMG]?t=1196161699",
