The only thing down grading this card is minor corner rounding, a small mark at the card's top and a wrinkle on the bottom left side (only really visiable when tilted in light). I will be out till later this evening but feel free to email me, I will respond to each email or post on the board. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nZach Rice\nZacharyrice@sbcglobal.net\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/nat2.jpg[/IMG]",
