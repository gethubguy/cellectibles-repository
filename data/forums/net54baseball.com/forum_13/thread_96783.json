If anyone could find it in themselves to part with one in the VG range I would greatly appreciate it!  Sorry, I don't have anything to trade, just $$.  I don't care if its raw of graded, just something in the VG range.  \n\nThanks\n\n\nAaron Cowan - acowan19@gmail.com\n<a href=\"http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/</a[/url]>",
