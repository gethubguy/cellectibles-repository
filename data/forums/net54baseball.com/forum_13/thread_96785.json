Then again, I don't expect hordes of people to fall over themselves for these \"gems.\"  Anyway, like I said scans of the front are available.  I'll try and get some back scans made within a day or two.\n\nAaron Cowan - acowan19@gmail.com\n<a href=\"http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/</a[/url]>",
