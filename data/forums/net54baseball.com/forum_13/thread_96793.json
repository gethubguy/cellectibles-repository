Looking for a nice lot of PSA 4 commons (PSA 5 if the price is right) - preferably no creases. To keep costs down I'm mostly interested in Piedmont and SC backs.  However, I wouldn't mind a few of the less common backs.  \n\nIf interested I have plenty of unopened wax from the 90s I would be happy to include as trade.\n\nPlease email me if interested.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nBrian",
