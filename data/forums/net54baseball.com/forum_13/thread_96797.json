      "post_content": "Posted By: Mark\nScans of all cards available.  Prices include delivery and insurance.\n\nHayden, Indianapolis.  Very large top border, one of the tallest T206 cards I have ever seen.  $75.\n\nUnglaub, Washington.  Orange background, instead of the usual red. Very clean card.  $125.\n\nSteinfeldt, portrait, Cubs.  Red background, instead of the usual orange.  Looks very nice alongside portraits of Tinker and Chance.  Beautiful card.  $125.\n\nJennings, dancing for joy.  This card has the Piemont 460 factory 42 NC back.  Looks near mint, measures perfectly.  I broke this card out of a Beckett holder, where it was graded 5.5 EX, sent it to PSA, and it was returned labeled evidence of trimming.  How stupid am I?  $250.",
