      "post_content": "Posted By: nbrazil\nT206 McGraw Glove at Hip PSA 1 For Sale. Looks much better than the grade. Creases not detectable on the scans bring the grade down.\n\nPrice: SOLD\n\nPrice includes S&H. Does not include insurance. If you want insurance, I will need to factor that into the price. I accept paypal, MO and checks. Emails take higher priority over posts on this thread. Only cards willing to trade for are low grade HOF T3's (must be graded by PSA or SGC) and a T206 magie. thanks!",
