Upside down and miscut back Van Buren/\"Stand the Test\" I had one other that was next to this one on the sheet and sold with my back collection a couple of years ago, other than that I have seen one other example of the upside down back. $500 delivered\n\n2. Wet sheet transfer Seaton, very crisp blue wet sheet transfer, so clear you can see the dot matrix. I have not seen another wet sheet transfer of this magnitude on an Obak card. It is much bluer and distinct in person, the picture is a bit washed out. $500 delivered\n\nScott\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3703105-DSC01766.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3703106-DSC01767.JPG[/IMG]",
