I am afraid the top could be trimmed, but I don't know. The original seller made no mention but it came with the \"all sales are final\" approach.\n\nPop is only 1 higher according to seller.\n\nThis sale is final as well, but at least I had the courtesy to mention my opinion of the card. Obviously if it crosses to a 6 even you're doing just fine. The weird stuff on the image below is from my scanner reflecting on the holder, sorry... it is a super clean card.\n\nYou be the judge.\n\n$150, free shipping. (OPEN TO OFFERS)\ntrae@t206.org\n\nThanks\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/dorner.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/dornertop.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/dornerbot.jpg[/IMG]",
