      "post_content": "Posted By: Brett\nLot of 7 t206s for sale. The scans are kind of bright from my crappy scanner, but I can re scan them at your request ! Asking $180 for the lot. Insurance is extra. Would prefer to sell them as 1 lot, but i'll listen to offers for individual cards. The Crandell has a slight tear on his right chest and is a Factory 42. The white spots on some of the other cards are not pieces missing, just some paperloss. \n\nThanks for looking [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1197170825.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1197170854.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1197170878.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1197170901.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1197170919.JPG[/IMG]",
