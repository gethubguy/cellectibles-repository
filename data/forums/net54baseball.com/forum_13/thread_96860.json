      "post_content": "Posted By: steve yawitz\nI just updated my sale/trade page with a couple of Hall of Fame hurlers. The Matty has terrific eye appeal but does have a few tiny, faint wrinkles on the front surface. If it weren't for my apprehensiveness - not to mention laziness - about cracking it out and submitting it to SGC, I'd almost certainly keep it. I still might end up sending it to Parsippany if it doesn't get a sniff here. \n\nThe Bender obviously has some edge issues, as it's one of the thin paper Kottons, but it's a relatively noteworthy player from a tough type.\n\nScans and prices are available here: [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/gradedbaseball[/url]. Paypal or check/money order are fine with me.\n\nThanks,\nSteve",
