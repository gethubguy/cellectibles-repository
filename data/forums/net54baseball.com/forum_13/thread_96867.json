I'm not sure if I understand the logic of why these three players are included on all the other 460 series backs...but not the Sovereign 460s.  Can anyone provide a brief explanation?",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Scot Reader\n\nHi Marc,\n\nThe three mentioned subjects are 350/460 \"regular print\" subjects and hence do NOT exist with the Sovereign 460 back.  The only subjects that exist with the Sovereign 460 back are the 48 subjects that were printed ONLY in the 460 series (minus Kleinow Boston and Smith Chicago and Boston, for reasons I won't bore you with, so the total is really 46) plus the six \"superprinted\" 350/460 subjects (Chase Blue, Chase Dark Cap, Chance Yellow, Cobb Red, Evers Yellow Sky and Matty Dark Cap).\n\nIt is also not quite true that these three subjects were printed on \"all the other 460 series backs.\"  For example, these three subjects will NOT be found with Sweet Caporal 460 Factory 30 (although they will be found with the other Sweet Caporal 460 back types e.g. Factory 25 and 42).\n\nHope this helps.  At least you can stop looking!\n\nScot",
