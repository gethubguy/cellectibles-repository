Really good condition just a slight amount of paper loss on 1 side of both packs.\n\n$25 delivered....what ever way you would like to pay.\n\nvintagecards@gmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/helamrboxes.jpg[/IMG]?t=1197560891\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/helmar2.jpg[/IMG]?t=1197560921\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/helmar3.jpg[/IMG]?t=1197561003",
