      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nThis is sort of a strang request but I have finally after years of selling/trading every card from the t205, t206, & t207 sets (because I never really cared for them to be honest) I have decided I was gonna slowly put these 3 sets together. This is where it gets wierd, I have decided I was going to do them alphabetically and each year just work on one letter of the alphabet at a time (this way it won't impact my other buying all that much).\n\nAs this year is almost over I decided I would go for one of the easy letters. Anyways these two players represent letters with only one card each. So if you have a mid-grade T206 card of Frank Isbell or Bob Unglaub I am interested, only request is that there be no writing, paper loss, etc on them. Any back is fine, but I would prefer tougher backs if given the choice.\n\nAnyways, thanks for any help, and I am sorry for being a little strange.\n\n-Rhett Yeakley\n\nemail to:\nrhettyeakley@netzero.com",
