Lower grade examples preferred as Santa has taken a sizable chunk out of the card fund this season (actually, the reverse is true, as well).\n\nI have a couple SGC 40 M-116's available (MacLean and someone else---I'm not home at the moment) and about 25 T206 doubles if you want to go the trade route.  I collect Obaks, too, but would prefer not to trade them as that's the set I'm currently working on as well.\n\nthanks,\nAnthony Stephenson\n\n\n\nemail:  boboinnes33@gmail.com\n\n              or\n \n        boboinnes33@hotmail.com",
