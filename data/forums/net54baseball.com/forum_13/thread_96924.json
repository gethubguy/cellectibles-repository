Anyways, if you have this card and wouldn't mind selling it for a profit, I would love to have it back. The money you make would be sufficient enough to buy the same card in a better grade.\n\n[IMG]http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h35/Comisky/DSC01786.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPlease email me at\n\njwilliams81@mac.com\n\nThanks\nJeff W.",
