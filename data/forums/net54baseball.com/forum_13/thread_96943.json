      "post_content": "Posted By: Jason Duncan\nThis group is for 41 T202 SGC graded cards.  Most cards are graded low due to flaws like stamp on reverse or small paper loss, but have awesome eye appeal.  Matter of fact I am really confused with many of the SGC A grades for none are trimmed.  Matter of fact these came from a forum member a year+ ago in raw form and all came from the same group.  Here is the list.  First $1800 takes them.  These are very nice looking and would get someone far into the set at a very affordable price.
