Don't mind paper loss on the back or a light crease/wrinkle, but eye appeal is most important to me.  Raw or graded is fine, but don't want anything like a 5 or above - too expensive.  Let me know what you have available + scans & price!\n\nThanks,\nRob\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",
