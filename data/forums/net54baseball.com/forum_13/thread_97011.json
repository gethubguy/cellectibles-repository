If so I'd love to buy it back, I miss it.\n\nEdited to add, I wouldn't mind seeing any other Magee portraits for sale. I'm looking for a well centered and registered version with a clean front.\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/magee.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",
