All three back types are represented.  The cards grade from F to EX, most in the VG range.  Instead of posting a very long list here.  Please email me at mackeyd@mailcity.com and I will send you the card list on an Excel spreadsheet.  Front and back scans available upon request.\n\nThanks,\nCraig",
