      "post_content": "Posted By: Jim T\nI have a Mantle autographed baseball that I am interested in trading for T206's that I need.  The ball was purchased from Kit Young in 1994 by my wife for my birthday.  I am not really an autograph collector and the ball has spent most of the last 13 years in the box it came in.  Auto is on an official AL ball which is snow white and does not have any staining or discoloration.  The signature is very clean and solid although not the boldest signature I have ever seen.  \n\nEmail me if you're interested or would like additional photos.\n\nedited to add: I am looking for card in F-G\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd315/JimT262/mantleball.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd315/JimT262/mantlecert.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]",
