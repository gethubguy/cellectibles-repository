I have saved the flips if you are interested to know which comapny graded them and what the grade was. I have made the scans Large and High resolution so you can see the condition clearly.\n\nFirst to say \"I will take it\" gets it.\n\nThank You\n\nJoe Jones\n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/joejo20[/url]",
