The white spot in the top left corner is not on the card it was caused by my scanner,Its 100% real and has great color and eye appeal. It has slight wear on all four corners and it has 1 small crease that barely breaks the card. \nIm also interested in the following cards if someone wants to trade. \n1963 Topps Pete Rose Rookie\n1964-1968 PSA 7-9 Pete Rose cards\n1948 Yogi Berra Ex-Nm-Mt\n1953 Topps Mickey Mantle\nT206 Cy Young Green\n1934 Goudey Lou Gehrig \n1933 Goudey Babe Ruth low grade\n1941 Play Ball Joe Dimaggio\n1938 Goudey Joe Dimaggio\nAny E Cards of Christy Mathewson\nLet me know, \n\n\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewfront.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewback.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewfrontright.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewfrontleft.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewfrontname.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k107/peterosepsa/cobbnewfronttop.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]",
