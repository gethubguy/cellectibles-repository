That is also very difficult, no?\"\n\n\nBob - sorry I missed your post and didn't reply earlier.\n\n\n\nI believe you are referring to the NY Americans card.\n\nThe NY Nationals card is not difficult at all.\n\n\nIn my opinion - based on my own collecting experience, and based on opinions I have received from other T200 set collectors (and going by the pop reports)...\n\nThe Boston Nationals is the toughest in the set.\nThe NY Americans is a close second - but not quite as tough (I have heard some arguments to the contrary - so an argument can be made).\n\nThe next two toughest are the two St. Louis Cards.\nThe rest of the set is fairly easy to come by.\n\nIts a great set to go for.  Good luck.",
