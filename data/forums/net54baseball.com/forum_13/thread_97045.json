      "post_content": "Posted By: rob\nI am selling a large group of T206's so please make me an offer. This is not a fire sale, simply looking to move a large group before breaking them up and going to ebay. Please only serious offers and inquiries, the market is proven as to the rough worth of this group so please calculate on your own. There are a couple duplicates, some are listed right next to each other, a couple are in different grades (clarke, duffy and strang).\n\nScans will be available upon request, but I would strongly prefer not to have to scan all 88 cards if possible.\n\nI will entertain offers on the group before selling individual cards.\n\nShipping and insurance TBD.\n\nthanks - Rob\nrgutheil@gmail.com\n\n\nSGC 80:\n\nWiltse, port no cap\n\nSGC 60:\n\nBaker\nmaloney\nford\nclancy\nfiene, port\nowen\nschmidt, throw\n\nSGC 50:\n\nmcginnity\nchance, yellow port\nwillis, throw\nmcgraw, glove hip\nduffy\ncoles\npastorius\nleifeld, pitch\ndelahanty, jim\ndonlin, seated\nphillippe\nsmith, heinie\njackson\nstarr\nnattress\nstrang\nlord\nclymer\nbarbeau\nhunter\nlake, ny\nmattern\nmanning, pitch\nbell, follow thru\ndoolan, bat\ntannehill,  tannehill on front\ntannehill,  tannehill on front\nperring\nphelps\nsnodgrass, catch\nsnodgrass, catch\nburch, field\nritter\nalperman\nganzel\nmurray, bat\n\nSGC 40:\n\nClarke, port\nLentz\ndowney, field\nfromme\no'leary, port\npattee\nbergen, bat\nyoung, irv\nsheckard, glove show\nwagner, bat on left\nwhite, doc - port\nbridwell, port cap\no'brien\nstrang\nburchell\nhinchman, harry\nknight, port\narndt\nabstein\nlord\n\nSGC 30:\n\nDavis, h davis on front\nJones, port\nanderson\nmcintyre, matty\nmurphy, bat\nferguson\n\nSGC 20:\n\nkillian, pitch\n\nPSA 4:\n\nClarke - port\nDuffy\nHuggins - port\nDavis\nMarquard, follow thru\nMarquard, follow thru\nWallace\nBeckley\nMarquard, hands thighs\nGriffith, bat\nGriffith, port\nSchirm\nConroy, bat\nWilson\n\n\nPSA 5:\n\nScott\nSchalfly\nSummers",
