Back scans (Sweet Cap 350) available on request but it's clean. Pretty nice for the grade if you ask me. The white line above his shoulder is not on the card... \n\n[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o318/davegeorge76/1909-1911T206Cobb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o318/davegeorge76/23.jpg[/IMG]",
