An SGC 50 Ten Million sold in Goodwin's May 2007 auction for $2,207 so I'm using that as a base price. My SGC 30 is priced at $1,750 or best offer close to it. I'd also consider trades, particularly for Bregstone and American League Publishing Co. postcards I need. It's a beautiful looking card. Emails have priority over posts. The price does not include shipping and insurance. All sales final since it's a graded card. Checks only, please.\n\nSGC 30 Ten Million front:\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/SGC3010MillionFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSGC 30 Ten Million back:\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/SGC3010MillionBack.jpg[/IMG]",
