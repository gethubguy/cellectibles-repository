      "post_content": "Posted By: Bob\nVery nice card. It is the second highest graded Series of 150 Manush, I own the other and it is not for sale any time soon. SGC lists the 150 series and 175 cards together in its population report but to my knowledge only 3 150 Series Manushs have been graded and I own all 3, a 70, a 40 and an Authentic.\nNo creases. These 150 Series cards are becoming impossible to find. Scan is not the greatest but will give a good idea.",

This card is of George Manush.\n\ntbob - I would have emailed you about the correction but you didn't list an email (which you may also want to fix if you want people to email you about  buying the card)",
