      "post_content": "Posted By: Misunderestimated (Brian H.)\nBefore I got things graded I kept my T-cards in this nice custom-sized, recessed holders.  I recall using them for T205, T206 and T207s although I guess others would fit as well. They snap together, the cards don't swim around and of course it is a lot cheaper (and more convenient)  than sending the cards to be graded.  \n\nI am selling 20 of them for $50 including postage -- which is based on what I recall paying & postage. \nPlease contact me if interested at bhodes@rcn.com\n\nemails to me trump posts to the board.\n\nI vaguely recall promising to sell some of these to someone a while ago so I am holding off on selling all the ones I have for the time being.  If whomever that was reads this please contact me to let me know if you are still interested etc.",
