I did not realize how long it would take to scan every card and then look up corresponding prices. To respond to each person would have taken me a week. I did manage to scan each of the following cards and price these lots out. All cards look great for their grade (just received from Sgc). Almost all of the cards are from that find from Kentucky and seem to me to have exceptional color with very white borders. The cards were found with rubber bands around them which had disintegrated over the years and seem to have a lot less handling than others with similar grades. I would like to sell these as lots, but if no one is interested by tomorrow morning, I will price them out individually. All prices include shipping, please add 3% if using Paypal. lmneal4@aol.com.\nThanks, Martin, call if you like, 434-825-6792 \n\n\nLot 1  all Sgc 30s  \nChance (red)         pending\nChase  (dark cap)    $38.00  pending\nDessau               $25.00   sold\nGuiheen              sold    \nMaddox               $25.00    sold\nMcginnity            sold\nMullen               $25.00     sold     \nPhelan               $25.00    sold\nPuttman              sold\nSchmidt              $25.00   sold\nSharpe               $25.00   sold \nStark                sold\nWright               $25.00   sold \n\n[IMG]http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e268/123MARTINS/chance-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e268/123MARTINS/mcginnity.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLot 2 all Sgc 40s \nAbbott                $35.00  pending\nAnderson              $35.00  pending\nBarbeau               sold\nBurke                 $35.00  pending\nBurns                 sold\nChase  (trophy)       sold\nCicotte               sold\nDonlin  (seated)      $35.00 pending\nDorner                sold\nFlick                 $100.00 pending\nGanley                sold\n Graham  (St. Louis)   sold\nHallman               $35.00 pending\nJacklitsch            $35.00 pending\nJordan   (batting)    $38.00 pending\nJones    (St.Louis)   $35.00 pending\nLavender              sold\nLundgren (K.C.)       sold\nMcCormick             sold\nMiller  (Pitts)       $35.00 pending\nO'Neil                sold\nPerring               $35.00  pending\nPuttman               sold\nRaymond               sold\nRossman               $35.00  pending\nRucker  (portrait)    sold\nRudolph               $35.00  pending\nSchmidt  (throwing)   $38.00  pending\nSmith  (F.
