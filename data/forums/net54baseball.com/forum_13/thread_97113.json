This Cranston has one mild corner wrinkle but is otherwise in solid GD/VG condition with no significant wear or creasing.  The back is perfectly clean and damage free.\n\nLooking to trade the card for Zeenuts from 1911-1920 however I'd sell the card for $185 if anyone had an interest in buying the card directly.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1200463935.JPG[/IMG]",
