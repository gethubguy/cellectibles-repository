      "post_content": "Posted By: T206Collector\n\"Fairly priced\" is a loaded question.  When I purchased mine, I had a number of people telling me that when the bidding went over $10K it was \"way overpriced.\"  But in my experience, people will often pay at least as much as the last auction for one of these super rarities.  And I have already been offered more than I paid for mine.\n\nWill Plank keep going up?  My theory has always been that as people get further along in chasing down the Monster on ebay, they will want to take runs at the super rarities.  I believe the remaining Planks and Magies should follow Wagner up the scale of unaffordability.  That is why I wanted to get in last April while it was still possible for under $20K.  And, I predicted at the time that scoring a PSA 1 Plank would cost about $20K, which is about what the cleaner PSA 1 went for the next (Saturday) night in REA.  As such, I had put aside that much in savings to go after Lionel Carter's Plank.  Fortunately, I got it for a lot less than I was willing to pay.\n\nIf this SGC 20 Plank went in last year's auctions, it would have gone for more than the PSA 1, but less than the SGC 30, which I think went for about $30K.  So, perhaps it would have sold for $25K.  As a result, I think this current Plank may not attract any starting bidders -- by that definition of \"fairly priced\" it is not.  However, if your question is will this card exceed $30K in the near future?  I would have to say it will.  (Unless, of course, Plank follows the rest of the T206 set in its diminishing value and the decreases are sustained over a long period of time.)\n\n_  _  _  _  _  _  _ _ \n\nVisit [url]http://www.t206collector.com[/url] for my blog, interviews, articles, card galleries and more!",
