The Bridwell is one of my dupes from the Jeff Morey collection, which you can hear/read about on my website.  The Jones is from the Pittsburgh-based pre-war autograph collection that was sold in small chunks on ebay during 2007.  I am looking for $300 each, but would do $550 for the pair.  \n\nIf you're interested in either or both, email:  SignedT206@gmail.com\n\n<a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/pmifsud3d/MoreyT205/photo?authkey=XzonIhFOLDY#5149740799696340706\"><img\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://picasaweb.google.com/pmifsud3d/MoreyT205/photo?authkey=XzonIhFOLDY#5149740799696340706\"><img src=\"[IMG]http://lh5.google.com/pmifsud3d/R3eN-Qs8huI/AAAAAAAACsU/yfTwTVKDPjU/s800/T205%20Bridwell%20A.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1201141797.JPG[/IMG]\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nVisit [url]http://www.t206collector.com[/url] for my blog, interviews, articles, card galleries and more!",
