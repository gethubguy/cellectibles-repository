Prefer lower grade (inexpensive) with good eye appeal.  #1 most important is focus.  Please send me an email with scans + price!  Caramel or Tobacco or Magazine supplement or neat photos - all are wanted.\n\nThanks,\nRob\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]\ntiger8mush @ yahoo.com",

At least not that i know of, hee hee.  \n\nEveryone once in a while I'll look at stats of players and this morning I was looking at the 1910 WS - A's vs Cubbies.  Well, Coombs pitched games 2 (Oct 18), 3 (Oct 20), and 5 (Oct 23).  He completed and won all three games for 27IP.  Bender pitched complete games in the other two (think he lost one in the 10th).  Philadelphia won the series (best of 7) in 5 games, only using two pitchers.  Pretty neat I thought.  So I wanted to pick up a card or two of him!  Impulse buying.
