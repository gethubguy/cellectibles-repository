Same back and everything. So I now have a spare T206 Hart, which I cracked out of an SGC 40 holder. I'd actually prefer trading it for a VG Southern Leaguer I still need, but cold, hard cash - or its virtual equivalent - would work, too.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\n[URL=\"http://photos.imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/rawt206s/T206%20Hart_%20J.%20_Montgomery_.jpg\"][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/rawt206s/icons/T206%20Hart_%20J.%20_Montgomery_.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nT206 Hart, J.
