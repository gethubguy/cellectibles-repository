My asking prices should be what the same card would sell for on ebay - I'm not trying to ask for any more then that.    If you disagree with a price, please let me know.  I will honor the first response I get for each card that commits to taking it.  \n\nPlease had $5 shipping (USPS Priority with delivery conf.) and insurance is optional at USPS cost.  I prefer money orders/personal checks  but will accept Paypal if you add 3%.  \n\n\n1914    Coupon Cigarettes        T213-2    TY COBB    PORTRAIT    10 Make an offer \n1933Goudey207MELVIN OTT30 SOLD\n1934Goudey37LOU GEHRIG10 SOLD\n1934-36 Diamond Stars14BILL TERRY193560 SOLD\n1934-36 Diamond Stars1LEFTY GROVE193510 SOLD\n1934-36 Diamond Stars9MICKEY COCHRANE193540 SOLD\n1941Playball18HANK GREENBERG40 SOLD\n1965Topps350MICKEY MANTLE20 SOLD\n\nRaw:\n1933Goudey138HERB PENNOCKPoor SOLD",
