      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\nPretty nice card for a \"30\".  No significant creases although it does have one small wrinkle in the upper right corner.  Centering is very good, color is terrific and the surface is mostly free from wear.  Corners have a bit of wear to them but nothing abnormal.  Back is clean and damage free.  \n\nAsking $450 on the card or would consider trades for Zeenuts.  Thanks in advance!\n\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1202525196.JPG[/IMG]",
