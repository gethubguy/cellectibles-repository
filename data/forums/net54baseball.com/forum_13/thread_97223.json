      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\n\nGuys, I think this is just a typo.  I've worked with Cy several times before and I know he's a good guy to have on the board.  I think what he meant to say is that if you pick the card up, the price is $17.50 (NOTE:  missing decimal point above) however if you want the card shipped to you the price is $22.  \n\nHope that clears it up and Cy can certainly correct me if I'm guessing wrong here.\n\nThanks,\nBrian",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Cy\nHello,\n\nThis is my try at making a joke. My thought was that the price would be $1750 if I deliver the card personally to you. You know, where I take a plane and hand it to you personally. I guess it's not good business to try to make humor when trying to sell a card.\n\nPeople of the Net 54 board, the price of the card is:\n\n$22\n\nand that includes delivery. I will hand it off to the Postman rather than do the delivery myself.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nAnd thanks, Brian, for sticking up for me. I appreciate it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCy\nwww.cyscards.com",
