      "post_content": "Posted By: Aaron Cowan\nVery simple...just looking for a T205 Bob Harmon (not the SP card).  Something in the VG range would do just fine.  Don't care about the back, I just want to avoid creases.  I also prefer it to be raw but would be fine with a graded card as well.  Just send me email if anyone is interested in parting with there Harmon card.  Thanks!\n\n\n\nAaron Cowan - acowan19@gmail.com\n[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/[/url]",
