      "post_content": "Posted By: Zach Rice\nI am selling the five T209-2s pictured below (Eldridge, Hooker, Andrada, Clemens and Dobson). All cards would grade poor-fair; the Dobson has an overall ex appearance but has the common paper loss on the card\u2019s upper border and a minor wrinkle that can\u2019t be seen in the scan. This is a small sampling of cards that rarely show; I am asking $400 delivered for the lot. \n\nThanks,\n\nZach Rice\nZacharyrice@sbcglobal.net\n\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/T209snet.jpg[/IMG]",
