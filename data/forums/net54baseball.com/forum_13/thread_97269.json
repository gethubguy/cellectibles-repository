      "post_content": "Posted By: steve yawitz\nThe thought has been percolating for a few months and after thinking about today's thread about how our collections evolve, I've decided the time has come. I'm still hanging onto my St. Louisans and a small handful of other favorites, but I now have about 175 or so T206's for sale. Everything from Abbaticchio to Wright, American Beauty to Tolstoi. (Uzit would have a nicer ring, I know, but I'm keeping it.)\n\nScans and prices are available here: [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/yawiesbaseballcards/19091911t206[/url]. All prices include shipping, so I can give a bit of a break on multi-card purchases. Almost all of the cards are raw, but many of them are crackouts and I guarantee all to grade. I can't promise specific grades, but I will offer refunds within 10 days if a card is not to your liking or within 90 days if a card is rejected by one of the big three grading companies.\n\nThanks for lookin',\nSteve\n\nOh yeah, I'd also consider trades for St. Louis players with rare backs.",
