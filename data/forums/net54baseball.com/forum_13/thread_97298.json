      "post_content": "Posted By: rob\nHello all,\n\nI have a large list of SGC 40 cards for sale. Sorry about the slightly confusing list, but unless there is a $amount next to the 40 (which is the SGC grade) then the card is worth $35. I am looking now for packages of 5 cards, then I will take care of the shipping. So 5 regular cards for $175 or adjust the price according to the price next to the card. Again, the 40 is simply the SGC grade listed, not the price, for most of the cards.\n\nrgutheil@gmail.com to reserve your group. paypal adds 3%.\n\nI have few scans, but do have the Johnson and kelley.\n\nRob\n\n\n6        1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   BILL HALLMAN            40\n8        1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   IZZY HOFFMAN            40\n10       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   FRANK LA PORTE          40\n12       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   DAN MCGANN              40\n17       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   PETER O'BRIEN           40\n20       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   EDDIE PHELPS            40\n25       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   GEORGE SCHIRM           40\n26       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   BUD SHARPE              40\n31       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   OWEN WILSON        40\n1        1909-11         Old Mill Cigarettes             T206   AL ORTH         40 - $100\n2        1909-11         Old Mill Cigarettes             T206   LUCKY WRIGHT            40 - $40\n6        1911    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   JOE LAKE, STL , ball in hand                40\n12       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   ARCH PERSONS            40  - $110\n13       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   JOE KELLEY              40 - $100\n14       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   TOM GUIHEEN             40 - $110\n16       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   WALTER JOHNSON          40 - $675\n25       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   JACK WHITE              40\n26       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   BILL LATTIMORE          40\n27       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   HARRY LORD              40\n28       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   FRANK ARELLANES         40\n31       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   BOBBY BYRNE             40\n32       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   DANNY MURPHY, horiz            40 - $55\n34       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   DAVY JONES              40\n41       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   SOLLY HOFMAN            40\n44       1910    Piedmont Cigarettes             T206   JOHN MCALEESE           40\n\nSGC 40:\n\n> Clarke, port - $100\n> Lentz - $100\nStark - $100\n> fromme\n> o'leary, port\n> young, irv\n> white, doc - port\n> o'brien\n> burchell\n> lord",
