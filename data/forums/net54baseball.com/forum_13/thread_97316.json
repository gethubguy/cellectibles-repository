I am in need of 50 of them total. I would rather get them in one lot or in a few different lots. Commons only and the lowest of the low. It is for a project I am doing. If someone has some for a good deal or would like to trade please e-mail me @ jseidler@cox.net. If you are in my area which is the 805 of California we can meet in person to do the deal. Thanks in advance!!!\n\nJosh",
