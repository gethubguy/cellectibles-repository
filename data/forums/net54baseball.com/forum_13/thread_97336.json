This is a pretty nice GD/VG card with very little wear, very nice color and one tiny wrinkle.  Back is clean and damage free as well.\n\nAsking $245 on the card or would consider a trade for Zeenuts or other t210s.  Thanks in advance for the interest.\n\nRegards,\n\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com  \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1202598712.JPG[/IMG]",
