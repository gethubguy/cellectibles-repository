I'm interested in Ex or better examples without creases. \n\nSome of the ones I'm looking for include: La Longe,  Mitze, Pearce, H. Smith, and Schmidt.\n\nI already have: Abbott, Berry, Grindle, Kuhn, Murray, Sheehan, Spencer, Tiedeman, and Thomas.\n\nI can purchase outright or I have a ton of items to trade.\n\nThanks,\n\nPatrick",
