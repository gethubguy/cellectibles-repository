Selling for $530 delivered.  Insurance at your option.\n\nCard has a light crease in the top left corner that doesn't go through to the back.\n\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/98302168_o.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/98302177_o.jpg[/IMG]",
