      "post_content": "Posted By: Seth Nagdeman\nI have two cards available.  A T205 Ty Cobb in a GAI2, and a T206 Cy Young in an SGC70 (The SMR for a 6 is $1,750 and a 5 is $1,150).  I am looking for an offer individually or for the pair.  Possible trades considered, but I would prefer to sell.  Please [URL=\"seth@19thcenturyonly.com\"]email[/URL] if interested. The first offer that sounds good I'll go with.  Thanks for looking.
