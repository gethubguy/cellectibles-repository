      "post_content": "Posted By: J.R.\nI bought an estate auction lot of paper, and while I get some sports cards, I got some that are really old.  One of them is a card that says Mathewson on the front, no first name and N.Y. Nat and the rest of the Nat is unreadable.  It has Sweet Caporal Cigarettes The Standard for Years on the back.  Then it says NEW Base Ball Series 350-460 subjects.  Like I said, I have a lot of newer cards that I pick up, but I want to know the value of this one.  I can send pictures to anybody that would like them, and would somebody please tell me how to sell this?  There were a few cards like it, and some other cards as well that I wouldn't mind help on.  Thanks\n\nJ.R.",
