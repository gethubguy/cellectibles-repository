Poor cards are fine, even real beaters as long as they are intact.  \n\nI have a bunch to trade including many short print and HOF T206s and T205s.  I will also buy if the prices are right.  Here's what I need:\n\nCOMMONS:\n\nBurch (fielding)\nCriger\nDemmitt (New York)\nDoolin\nElberfeld (portrait-New York)\nGraham (St. Louis)\nHemphill\nKleinow (Boston)\nKleinow (catching-New York)\nKroh\nLake (ball in hand)\nLobert\nMullin (with bat)\nNeedham\nNiles\nPfeister (seated)\nPowell\nReulbach (no glove showing)\nWagner (bat on right shoulder)\nWilhelm (with bat)\n\nSOUTHERN LEAGUERS\n\nBay\nFoster\nHelm\nHickman\nJordan\nKiernan\nLipe\nManion\nOtey\nPaige\nRevelle\nSeitz\nShaughnessy\nC.
