While there my brother and i got to looking at his baseball cards.  He told us the Allen @ Ginter cards were his when he was young.  I am wondering if the cards we bought for around $10 might be worth alot more! In particular i am wondering if these cards ever came with serrated edges? any info will be greatly appreciated",
