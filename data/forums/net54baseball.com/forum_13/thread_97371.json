If you have something to trade, send me an email: crazylocomerk@yahoo.com\n\nHere are the cards I have for trade. I'm not looking to sell any of these.

Penciled in 25 on back.\n[IMG]http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k14/crazylocomerk2/1910E103PastoriousWilliamsCaramelCo.jpg[/IMG]\n\nE104-II George Gibson Nadja Caramel Blank Back.
