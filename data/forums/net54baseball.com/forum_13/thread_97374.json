Very cool display piece (especially for t206 fans), just trying to free up some wall space!\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/images/framedbacks001.jpg[/IMG]\n\nedited: hope you don't mind the borrowed scan Trae!

No big deal though, I would be happy to provide better images of pieces like yours if anyone needs a better look to make a buying decision, just drop me a line.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n---\n\"There ain't much to being a ballplayer, if you're a ballplayer.\"\n-Honus Wagner",
