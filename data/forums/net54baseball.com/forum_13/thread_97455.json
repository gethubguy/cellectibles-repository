[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]\n\nPlenty of pre war cards for sale.\n\nI pay all shipping and paypal fees. If you would rather pay another way email me..\nMany Hofers plus many Cubbies, Highlander commons....\n\n\nHighlights include:\n\nGAI 3 Orange T206 Cobb Portrait\nPSA 3 T206 Willie Keeler Portrait\nPSA 3 Tinker Portrait\nSGC 20 Johnson Portrait\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.the-stockyard.com/bbcards/cards4sale1.htm\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://www.the-stockyard.com/bbcards/cards4sale1.htm</a[/url]>\n\n\nEdited to say all purchases are packaged and will be shipped out tomorrow...  Thanks... \nAlso wanted to add that this web page will not auto update when a card is sold. I have to do that manually...  I'm technologically challenged [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",
