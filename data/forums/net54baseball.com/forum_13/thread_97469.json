Included in this lot you will receive not only the very early, pre-T206 Connersville postcard of Ellam, but a Nashville T206 as well as (2) funeral programs (one for Roy and one for his wife) and several local newspaper clippings detailing his horrific death.  Price on the lot is $500, but I will also consider cash/trades.  Email me, TwirlerReulbach@sbcglobal.net if interested.\n\n<a href=\"http://imageevent.com/deadballeracubs/forsaleortradenew/everythingelse?p=11&n=1&m=-1&c=5&l=0&w=4&s=0&z=9\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://imageevent.com/deadballeracubs/forsaleortradenew/everythingelse?p=11&n=1&m=-1&c=5&l=0&w=4&s=0&z=9</a[/url]>\n\n<a href=\"http://imageevent.com/deadballeracubs/forsaleortradenew/everythingelse?p=12&w=4&c=5&n=0&m=-1&s=0&y=0&z=9&l=0\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://imageevent.com/deadballeracubs/forsaleortradenew/everythingelse?p=12&w=4&c=5&n=0&m=-1&s=0&y=0&z=9&l=0</a[/url]>",
