I've looked at these spots under magnification and can't determine whether those white spots are paper loss or simply white spots.  There is also a tiny crease in the uppermost right corner, perhaps 1/4th of an inch long.\n\nThe card's back earned it its grade.  As you can see there is an area of paper loss, about the size of a quarter.\n\nI'm only selling the card, the cuff link stays with me. --- SOLD\n\nAnthony Stephenson\nboboinnes33@gmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q82/boboinnes/magie-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q82/boboinnes/magie_close.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q82/boboinnes/Magie_back.jpg[/IMG]",
