Scans and prices are available on my site: [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/rawt206s[/url].\n\nAll prices include shipping. And all cards are guaranteed - 10 days if you're not happy, 90 days if a major grading company does not assign a numerical grade.\n\nThanks,\nSteve",

      "post_content": "Posted By: steve yawitz\n...for some new additions to my T206 folder. I added close to 20 St. Louisans - mainly f/g through vg- commons though I think a Bresnahan, Waddell and Wallace are in the mix as well. They're all nice cards that I wouldn't mind keeping, but I'm in the midst of rescanning my collection and also wouldn't mind lightening the workload.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99[/url]",
