      "post_content": "Posted By: raymond g. pasternak\nRecently had to acquire this card when purchasing cards I collect.  It only grades a SGC 10 the gold borders are bad.  However, its the rare Hoblitzell (name spelled correct, no \"cinn\" after the 1908 stats.,) listed as card # 90d in SCD.  I have no need for the card since I do not collect t205's, if anyone is interested email me and I will shoot you a scan.  Hope someone can use it in your collection!",
