      "post_content": "Posted By: Scott Levy\nWe need about half of the cards listed in this lot as upgrades....would anyone be interested in teaming up with us on this lot?  If so, I'd be happy to either split the cost or work out some other reasonable arrangements for the partner to receive my downgrades (all PSA 4s) at a discount.  If interested, shoot me a line at scottglevy@yahoo.com\n\nDESCRIPTION IS BELOW..........\n\nCollection of sixteen rare T206 Southern Leaguers (out of the 48 cards which comprise the entire \u201cSouthern League\u201d subset), each graded and encapsulated EX 5 by PSA. The collection is comprised of the following:  Bernhard - Nashville (Old Mill back), Carey \u2013 Memphis (Piedmont back), Coles \u2013 Augusta (Piedmont back), Cranston - Memphis (Piedmont back), Guiheen \u2013 Portsmouth (Piedmont back), Hooker - Lynchburg (Piedmont back), Lafitte - Macon (Piedmont back), Molesworth - Birmingham (Old Mill back), Orth \u2013 Lynchburg (Piedmont back), Perdue - Nashville (Piedmont back), Rockenfeld \u2013 Montgomery (Piedmont back), Seitz \u2013 Norfolk (Piedmont back), Stark \u2013 San Antonio (Old Mill back), Thornton \u2013 Mobile (Old Mill back), Westlake \u2013 Danville (Piedmont), and White \u2013 Houston (Piedmont back). The Southern Leaguers have always been appreciated for their scarcity and as a popular subset to the T206 series. Collectors find it particularly challenging to assemble a complete set. This is a very attractive high-grade collection of sixteen cards, which could provide a strong foundation for a set of T206 Southern Leaguers, or contribute significantly in the assembly of a high-grade T206 set. The SMR value for the assigned grades is $3,360. Total 16 cards. Reserve $1,000. Estimate $2,000/$3,000.",
