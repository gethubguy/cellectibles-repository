I took the time to see what the going rate is for each of the cards. You would be saving money buy buying the lot. The price i came up with to purchase these cards is roughly around 1k. I am offering the lot for $725.00. Please e-mail me if interested. I can ship them out asap. I prefer paypal.\n\nBender/Oldring SGC 50\nAbstein/Butler SGC 50\nDowns/Odwell SGC 40\nElberfeld/Mcbride PSA 4\nStovall/Turner PSA 4\nSummers/Jennings PSA 4\nMiller/Herzog PSA 6mc (Razor sharp Corners)\nLush/Hauser PSA 7mc (Razor sharp Corners)\nWoodruff/Williams PSA 5 mc\nMattern/Graham PSA 5\nLeifield/Simon PSA 3\nHartzell/Blair PSA 4\nBaker/Downie PSA 2",
