I do not care what condition they are in just email me scans and what you want for them.  If you have a Fred Toney from Series 6 I would be especially interested, but I am looking for any card from the set so if you want to sell it I am intersted in buying it regardless of which player it is.  Thank you for your time\n\nWilliam.  email is wacturner@hotmail.com",
