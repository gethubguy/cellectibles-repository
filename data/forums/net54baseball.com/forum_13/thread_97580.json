Vertical crease that is hard to see causes downgrade): $85\nFrank Chance Yellow Portrait SGC 20 (Really nice card, paperloss on back causes downgrade): sold\nCobb Bat off PSA 3 (Really nice card for the grade): sold\n\nEmails take priority over posts. If you want me to hold the card, let me know. Otherwise, I will sell cards to those who say they will take them. Shipping and Handling included in price. Insurance is not. If you want insurance, will need to include it. thanks\n\n[IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6JlP%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJeGnlQqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPan%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,255,442[/IMG][IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6Jlo%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJelaJGqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPnG%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,255,442[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6Jao%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJelaJeqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPn0%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,266,442[/IMG][IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6JaG%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJe0leaqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPan%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,268,442[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6JnG%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJelaGQqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPno%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,274,442[/IMG][IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6Jno%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDofRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlnQJelaGoqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPnl%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,272,442[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6JGJ%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDPfRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlaJQoPaPlqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPGQ%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,251,442[/IMG][IMG]http://render-2.snapfish.com/render2/is=Yup6JaP%7C%3Dup6RKKt%3Axxr%3D0-qpDPfRt7Pf7mrPfrj7t%3DzrRfDUX%3AeQaQxg%3Dr%3F87KR6xqpxQPoJxPQox0l0xv8uOc5xQQQGlaJQoPaooqpfVtB%3F*KUp7BHSHqqy7XH6gX0QPGe%7CRup6aQQ%7C/of=50,266,442[/IMG]",
