I am looking for almost any other prewar card (strip cards are fine) in trade.  Obviously these are beaters (or worse than beaters if there is a lower distinction), so I am valuing them at about 5.00 each, so hopefully you have something to trade (anything but graded cards!).  Please let me know what you want to trade!\nAlan Elefson\naelefson@hotmail.com\n[IMG]http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h262/aelefson/March820083.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h262/aelefson/March820084.jpg[/IMG]",
