Price includes S&H. Insurance not included. If you would like insurance, I will need to factor it in the price. Only personal check/MO. If want paypal, will need to factor in 2.9% paypal fee.\n\n[IMG]http://www.geocities.com/nbbgmad/cobbgreenfront.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.geocities.com/nbbgmad/cobbgreenback.jpg[/IMG]",
