      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\n\nCARD IS NOW SOLD....THANKS GUYS!\n\nVery popular t206 with a strong image of Johnson.  It's in a 10 holder due to a couple wrinkles on the front and a bit of discoloration on the surface however this is still a really nice looking card.  The back is clean but does have a couple small scrapes.  Asking $285 or would consider trades for w590s or 1915-1920 and 1932 Zeenuts.  Thanks in advance,\n\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\nPS...the t205 Clarke in the scan is available as well if anyone is interested.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1208022717.JPG[/IMG]",
