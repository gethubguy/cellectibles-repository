I have the cards broken into lots with individual prices or I will give you a price for quantity buys.\n\nAt this time I am not interested in selling individual cards, I want to sell them in lots with $100 minimum.  You can mix and match between lots.\n\nPlease email me for the scans and prices.\n\nThanks\n\nLee",
