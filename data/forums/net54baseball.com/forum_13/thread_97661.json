There is a very, very slight wrinkle in the lower right corner that cannot be seen unless held under light at a specific angle.\n\nPlease see scans. If interested, please email me at herbwlim@verizon.net. First person to say \"I'll take it\", gets the card.\n\nChecks and money orders accepted. Paypal is ok, but please add 3%.\n\nThanks,\nHerb\n\n[IMG]http://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q190/herblim/t212_weaver1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q190/herblim/t212_weaver2.jpg[/IMG]",
