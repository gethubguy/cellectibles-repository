The SGC 60's are in nice shape with good color, and the southern leaguer is a clean typical VG card with an irregular top cut which passed to a VG holder. \n\nAlso looking for a Chase w/Old mill back, i wont trade the Hindu for it but if theres any interest in the other two give me a shout, thx!\n\nSGC 60 Stanage SC 350\nSGC 60 Murphy w/bat Pied.350\nSGC 40 Mullaney SL Hindu\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1208724435.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1208904836.JPG[/IMG] \n\n\n\nedited: to re-write",
