(The one I have even has an Old Mill back!)  In the past I had bought a GAI slabbed Dahlen (Brooklyn) only to have it revealed as \"color added\" when I tried to cross it over to SGC.  Just recently I bought an SGC 10 Dahlen (Brooklyn) on the B/S/T board.\n\nFortunately, that has been the biggest mistake I have made with the T206 set.\n\nScott",
