I lost my contract (downsizing) at work and it is time to sell as I might be unemployed for the next 6 months or more.\n\nIf you know me or my collection, you know I chose cards on their eye appeal. This Cobb is a beautiful example with some light creasing, but the corners are sharp with only minor gold flaking - Piedmont back\n\nScans on request\n\nPrice is shipped, Insurance extra and HEAVILY recommended \n\nI also have more T205 for sale if interested\n\ncash/check/MO, paypal with 3% extra for fees\n\nthanks!\nRuss\n\n\nambrosia2@hotmail.com\n\nedited to add e-mail",
