I was going to break it out of the slab and reholder it (or keep it raw), but I recently bought an upgrade.\n\nThe price above includes S&H. Emails take priority over posts. If you would like insurance, I will need to factor it in the price. If you would like to hold the card, you will need to explicitly say so. Otherwise, the card goes to the first taker.\n\n[IMG]http://www.geocities.com/nbbgmad/krausefront.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.geocities.com/nbbgmad/krauseback.jpg[/IMG]",
