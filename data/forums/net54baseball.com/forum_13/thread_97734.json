The Dahlen is the rarer \"Brooklyn\" version which I recently bought not realizing that I had previously misfiled a Brooklen version as the Boston version.  D'oh!\n\n[IMG]http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y133/scottopotamus/Trade%20Bait/Graded%20Cards/scan.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBoth cards have substantial paper loss on the back and the Dahlen also has some kind of mark on it.\n\nThese cards are the reasons they invented the \"poor\" grade.\n\nDahlen $125.00\n\nPersons  $30.00\n\nScott",
