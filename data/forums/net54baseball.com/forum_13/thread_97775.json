Open to offers, but likely to accept the first cash offer at around $5k.  And if it doesn't sell, I think I can live with having the card a little longer \n\n[IMG]http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii142/scottglevy/warhopback-1.jpg[/IMG]\n<img src=\"http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii142/scottglevy/warhopfront.jpg*>\n\nRegards,\nScott",
