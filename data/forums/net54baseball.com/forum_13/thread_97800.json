      "post_content": "Posted By: Leslie Westbrook\nI'm selling the following cards, and I prefer Paypal, but I will accept a money order. All prices include shipping and paypal fees. If interested in trading, I'd prefer a single-card trade for the lot, but I'll listen to other offers as well. I'm also posting a few post-war cards for sale in that category, so take a look if you're interested. I'll also accept sell and trade offers on the entire group of cards, pre- and post-war combined. Thanks!\n\nNEW PRICE OFFER: $30 for what's left, Thanks!\n\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/swansonfront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/swansonback.jpg[/IMG]\n$15\n\n\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/stonefront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/stoneback.jpg[/IMG]\nSOLD\n\n\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/mitchellfront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/mitchellback.jpg[/IMG]\n$5\n\n\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/knightfront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/knightback.jpg[/IMG]\nSOLD\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z56/lesliewestbrook/sweetcappinfront.jpg[/IMG]\n$15",
