Accordingly, I am pricing it between a PSA 5 and PSA 6. The back is Piedmont. The only flaws are the top left corner and the back is off center. If I do not sell it here, I am going to cross the card with SGC. \n\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/halpen/top40/websize/cobb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nI am looking for $1,350 on this card.
