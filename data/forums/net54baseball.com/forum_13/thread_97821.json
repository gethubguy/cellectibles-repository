It certainly wouldn't pain me to hold onto these, but it also wouldn't pain my bottom line, which is being traumatized by some major home improvements, to let a few go. Anyway, prices and pics are available here: [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/gradedbaseball[/url]\n\nThanks,\nSteve",

It's a pretty respectable 2 with a clean reverse. $210 includes insured shipping. \n\nThanks again,\nSteve\n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99[/url]",
