      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Masinick\nGood question.  It's not really a super secret sale or anything.  However, the cards are owned by a group of people, not one individual.  And there are terms and conditions that dictate that a vote must be taken of the shareholders if the offer value is less than a certain price.  If you email me I can tell you the \"buy it now\" price on any card or let you know the minimum offer that we would put up for a vote.   It's a tad complicated, but I'm sure I can explain it to you...  please email me and let me know which cards/lots you're interested in and we can go from there.\n\nMike Masinick\nCardTarget.com",
