I'd probably most like to pick up another graded pre-war HOF'er card of comparable value... something from T205 or T206 would be great... but I'm open to considering any and all trade ideas.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t275/Elemenopeo/Trading%20up%20to%20Mantle/File4948.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t275/Elemenopeo/Trading%20up%20to%20Mantle/File4949.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nelemenopeo@gmail.com\n\n\nTHIS CARD IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR TRADE",

I started with a raw 1986 Topps #418 Alan Knicely and have since made my way to the 1940 Play Ball Hubbell.
