I have all other T3 HOF'ers in 5's or better and I've been hung up for quite a while trying to upgrade this last PSA 4 HOF'er to 5... I also have a couple of common T3 PSA 5's and a 6 that can be entered into trade talks...\n\nIf you have one, please shoot me an email...\n\nMany thanks,\n\nDennis",
