      "post_content": "Posted By: Martin\nI'm looking to add an American Beauty (one from any of the three types) and an El Principe De Gales backed t206 common to my collection. I would prefer PSA graded examples in either a 3 or a 4 but would also consider a SGC 40 or 50.\n\nBy the way - I live in England so you must be willing to ship internationally.\n\nMany thanks\n\nMartin \nmarpar73@hotmail.com\n\nEdited to add link to current collection:\n\n[url]http://martinsbaseballcardscollection.com[/url]",
