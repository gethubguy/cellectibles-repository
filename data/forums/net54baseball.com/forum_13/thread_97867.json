Absolutely beautiful card, probably would have graded a 5, except that somebody apparently tried to recolor a bit of the top border.  This card has great corners, and is absolutely clean with tremendous color, and no creases or wrinkles.  Graded PSA A.  $375 delivered.\n\nTurkey Red Mike Mitchell.  Very nice, would have graded 3 or 4, however, someone has recolored the tips of the four corners.  They did an extremely nice job - you don't notice it unless you are specifically looking for it.  Graded PSA A.  $175 delivered.\n\nFront and back scans of both cards available.",
