      "post_content": "Posted By: Ron Lambert\nDear All\n\nI've been mulling over a sale of my approx 3/4 of a T207 set and thought I would throw it out here to gauge interest. At this juncture, I have no interest in selling any cards individually.\n\nI believe that I have scans of almost every card available on the SGC website at the following link:\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=54&userset=1822[/url]\n\nThe only cards missing from the SGC site are Livingston small C, Austin w/Insignia and Fisher w/White Cap.\n\nOverall 25 of the cards have a rare back with 12 being ANONYMOUS, 5 \nBROADLEAF, 4 NAPOLEON, and 4 RED CYCLE.\n\nOverall grade breakdown is as follows:\n\nSGC 10: 3 cards \nSGC 20: 4 cards\nSGC 30: 15 cards\nSGC 40: 52 cards\nSGC 50: 35 cards\nSGC 60: 24 cards\nSGC 70: 5 cards\nSGC 80: 7 cards \nSGC A: 1 card  \n\nIf anyone wants a spreadsheet with the full breakdown, I'd be happy to provide it.\n\nRegards\n\nRon",
