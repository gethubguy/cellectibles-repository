If I buy something for $1 and bid 1000x on it and list it here for $10000 on this BST it's still my right to do it...and there is a board rule against this type of post you made. I am going to give you a wedgie at the National....now cut it out [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]..... (leon aka moderator dude)....",

Yeah, I bought the card a few weeks ago and now want to sell it, so what? There is nothing wrong with this and many others on the board do it. Why don't you go and bother them for awhile.\n\nBottomline, it is what I want to charge for a card, if no one buys it, so be it. If you do not want the card, please restrain yourself from commenting.",
