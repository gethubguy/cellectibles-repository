      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\n\nI always kind of wanted to collect a particular \"back type\" so I figured I'd see what was out there.  I probably won't go after all four in the long term, but figured, as always, I'd see what was available and then go for that \"type\".  These are the four I'm looking for right now.  I'd prefer lowgrade, raw or even trimmed examples (so that I can afford more cards!).  Not really looking for anything too fancy at this point.  I have a few cards available for trade if that helps as well.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",
