      "post_content": "Posted By: Martin Neal\nI can't do it. I have been trying to do both the T205 and the T206 sets and I am comtemplating selling the T205s. I love both sets equally, but the T206 was my first love. The t205 set includes some very rare cards including a Psa 4 Hoblitzell no stats, Psa 5 Wallace one line, Psa 5 Bresnahan open mouth, Psa 4 Moran stray line and other notable toughies. I think it is number 17 or 18 on the psa registry. This set could easily (relatively) be upgraded to a top 10 or better set. Scans are available to anyone who is interested.\n\nThanks, Martin  434-825-6792",
