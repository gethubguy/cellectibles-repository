Low grades preferably. \nA colleague of mine used to admire his grandma's small T206 collection and when his grandpa died, his grandma threw them out, so a couple of us have teamed up in search of a few (a dozen or so) to suprise him with during his birthday at work.\n\nIf you have any you are looking to sell .. just any ol' condition, let me know.",

For someone who is looking to admire these T206s it really is the perfect group of cards.\n\nIf interested contact me via email and we'll work out something that is fair:\nscottglevy@yahoo.com",
