      "post_content": "Posted By: Lance\nI have 2 Walter Johnson T3's for sale or trade. All offers will be considered. These are very nice examples, but I will only guarantee them to be authentic. I do very little with T3's and would not want to place a numeric grade on either. I have included 800 dpi scans, so you experts should be able to get a pretty good feel. Please be sure to indicate which example or both you wish to make an offer. I accept all forms of payment, but if you choose to use paypal, I only ask for it to be an E-check. \n\n#1 This card has a crease or fold that appears to have been pressed in the field on the lower right. The back is extremely clean. I have included a scan of the field area in question.\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/T3Johnson1001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/T3Johnson1003.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/T3Johnson1002.jpg[/IMG]\n\n#2 This card is probably more sound than the first. The corners are a little nicer, but the back has a water stain. The colors are not as viberant as the first, but it is an excellent collector's grade card.\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/T3Johnson2004.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/T3Johnson2005.jpg[/IMG]",
