While you might be hard pressed to find a PSA 1 for $350, another 100 bucks and some patience will land you a very presentable Cobb.  I looked for months for a red Cobb in my price range that presented well until I saw one listed with BIN for $550.  I offered the seller $450 and he jumped on it.  Made me wish I had offered a little less but I was still happy with it.\n\nIn any case, Jamie, just be patient and hold out until you find a card that you are satisfied with.",

I purchased my PSA 1 for around $500, but I thought for the grade it had great eye appeal.  One moderate crease at the right border, no paper loss on back, but very slight discoloration of back (staining?)\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1213974037.JPG[/IMG] \n\nAre you opposed to buying one raw?  You might save a little, then have it graded.\n\nMike",
