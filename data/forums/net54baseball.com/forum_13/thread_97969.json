      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nI am admittedly not an expert on tobaccco boxes but everything appears to be right about this box being one that contained baseball cards, or at least it is possible. The box retains a 1910 tax stamp with a 1912 date overprint. The box also includes (on the slide shell) the factory # related to the baseball players (Factory No. 240 1st Distrct Pennsylvania).\n\nI make no guarantees that this box originally came with a card or not but everything appears to point to that. The very top flap of the slide shell is missing but otherwise the box is in good working order.\n\n $100 shipped  takes the box. Email with any questions. Item pictured larger than it actually is to show any imperfections.\n\n-Rhett Yeakley\nrhettyeakley@netzero.com\n[IMG]http://starsofthediamond.com/t207box.JPG[/IMG]",
