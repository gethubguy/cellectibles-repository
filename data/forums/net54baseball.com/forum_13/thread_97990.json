I'm also trying to see how far I can get with the t210-3 set by just collecting orange cards. Please let me know if any of you have any you'd consider parting with.  Any condition is welcome.  Thanks much!\n\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",

If you have any of these lying around, I'd be willing to buy or trade in your favor for the card.  Any condition is welcome.  Also, been looking for that t210-7 Kelly for a while too.   It's another card I'd pay generously for.  \n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",
