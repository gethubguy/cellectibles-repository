      "post_content": "Posted By: David R\nI was considering trading the multiple overprint Lash's Bitters ad T206 below.  This is really a striking card.  I am looking for a green Cobb but would consider other t206s if anyone is interested.  A copy of both sides of the original trade card advertisement that is overprinted on the back is also pictured below for reference.  I believe both sides of the post card are overprinted on the T206. If you look at the bottom part of the t206, you can see the outline of the last man on the far right of the bar and the outline of the \"Lash's Bitters\" sign that is hanging on the wall in the bar to his right.  Please email me.\n\nEdit:  Sorry I originally posted a scan of the wrong card.  It's now correct (the Barger). \n\n \nsrc=\"[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214261605.JPG[/IMG]\"> \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214265893.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214265914.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214265942.JPG[/IMG]",
