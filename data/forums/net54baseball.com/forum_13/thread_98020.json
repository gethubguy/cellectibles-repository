      "post_content": "Posted By: Bryan Long\nI have decided to take offers on my t201 collection.  I would rather sell the group as a whole if possible, because I don't have much time to sell card by card.  If interested in the group, please send me an offer and maybe we can work something out.  I would also be willing to trade for HOFers and a trade/cash deal.  There are two cards that I just bought that have not arrived yet, but they should in a few days.\nThanks,\nBryan Long\n\nUngraded cards (range probably SGC 10 to 30)\n\nWiltse/Merkle\nLiefield/Simon\nDooin/Titus\nLapp/Barry\nWallace/Lake\nHickman/Hinchman\nCicotte/Sweeney\n\nPSA Graded:\nMcGinnity/McCarty PSA 1\nKling/Cole PSA 5\nLapp/Barry PSA 4\n\nSGC graded:\nAbstein/Butler      30\nBarrett/McGlynn     40\nMatthewson/Bridwell 40\nChase/Sweeney       60\nGaspar/Clarke       30\nThomas/Coombs       60\nRucker/Daubert      40\nDonovan/Stroud      50\nTitus/Dooin         30\nDowns/Odwell        30\nDoyle/Meyers        30\nSeymour/Dygert      50\nMcBride/Elberfeld   50\nKillian/Fitzpatrick 40\nFoster/Ward         40\nLeach/Gibson        30\nMattern/Graham      40 \nGrant/McLean        40\nLush/Hauser         40\nMiller/Herzog       40\nLaPorte/Stephens    40\nLobert/Moore        50\nMcCabe/Starr        70\nTurner/Stovall      40\nWoodruff/Williams   40\n\n\n.",
