      "post_content": "Posted By: Iggy...\n\nI have the following T206 Lot for sale.  It contains \"50\" different T206 cards ALL in the Fair to Good range (with a few in the Poor range).  All of them commons but it does contain a T206 Summers with the name on the top and bottom plus the semblance of a \"Sweet Caporal\" ghost print (not really visible).  Also a T206 Kleinow but it's the more common New York version.  Four of the cards have a little bit of writing on the front (including the Kleinow).  Assortment of backs, but 80% (of the backs) have either some writing or paper loss (or a combination).  \n\nHere is my offer, at this moment (since it changes all the time) the Microsoft / Ebay promotion is at 25% off.  If anyone is interested, I will put the lot on eBay with a \"Buy it Now\" price of $780 which will include shipping.  With the use of the promotion (you will have to use paypal and sign-up for the promotion) it will knock down the price to $585 (of course you will have to wait 60 days before Microsoft reimbursed you via paypal).  Here are the pics if anyone is interested... my email is:  agonzdude@yahoo.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214918278.JPG[/IMG]  [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214918293.JPG[/IMG] \n\nFor reference, here is the Net54 thread that \"talks-about\" the Microsoft promotion: \n [url]http://www.network54.com/Forum/153652/thread/1213667773/last-1214494638/Crazy+Ebay+Deal+-+25%25+UP+TO+%24250+OFF+ANY+BIN+PURCHASE[/url]\n\n-Lovely Day...",
