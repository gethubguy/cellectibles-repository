Cards below are for sale; feel free to make an offer.\n\n$5 for USPS Priority with delivery confirmation, but am open to other shipping methods if desired.  Paypal please add 3%.\n\nThe E cards I have for sale are [URL=\"http://www.network54.com/Forum/376259/thread/1208966027/last-1210011554/Difficult+E+Hall+of+Famers+NOW+FOR+SALE\"]here.[/URL]\n\n1. Johnson Hands at Chest TOLSTOI PSA 4 (MC) Card has name split top and bottom and very clean back; between SGC and PSA, only a Tolstoi Johnson has graded higher then a 4.  $900\n2. Johnson Portrait PSA 4 Front of the card would be a 6 but back staining kept it down; you would be hard pressed to find a nicer front on a 4.  $1000\n3. Shaw VG-EX $42\n4. Konetchy Glove Above EX $65\n5. Fiene VG $21\n6. Spade P (nice front, back paper loss) $15\n\n\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/122700236_o.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/122700262_o.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/122700279_o.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/6/7/8/8/1/7/webimg/122700297_o.jpg[/IMG]",
