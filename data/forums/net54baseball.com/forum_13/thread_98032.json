      "post_content": "Posted By: Jon Canfield\nFor those of you that collect cigarette packs, this needs no introduction.  Quite possibly Broadleaf is the rarest cigarette pack of all of the T-206 brands.  I\u2019ve recently acquired a second Broadleaf that I am offering for sale.  The cigarette pack is in amazing condition and, to the best of my knowledge, the finest copy out there.\n\nThe pack is a 15 count cigarette pack.  It is from Factory 25, 2nd District of Virginia.  Amazingly, it still retains 10+ of it\u2019s original cigarettes.  However, the pack does not have a tax stamp for closer dating.  Furthermore, there is no reference to the ATC or L&M on the pack.  Based on the 15 count cigarette configuration, I believe this pack dates from 1910 \u2013 1917 which I have confirmed with a few others.  It is impossible for me to speculate as to which year it dates however there is a possibility it is from the T206 distribution era although I do not have any definitive proof to say so for sure.  If interested, please email me for pricing.\n\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view\u00a4t=IMG_3375.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_3375.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view\u00a4t=IMG_3374.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_3374.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view\u00a4t=IMG_3373.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_3373.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view\u00a4t=IMG_3377.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_3377.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",

Also, I'd be willing to list on eBay with a BIN so that the purchaser can get a reduced price using the Microsoft Live feature.  I'd also listen to cash-trade offers.",
