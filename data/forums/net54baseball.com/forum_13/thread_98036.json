The Series 4 cards are $70 each and the Series 7 and 8 cards are $250 each. I will trade any Series 7 or 8 card for an Old Judge card with a nice photo (your choice). I don't care what the back looks like as long as it is original and the card isn't rebacked or trimmed. Otherwise, whatever player you want to trade is fine with me.\n\nSeries 2: Hoffman\n\nSeries 3:\n\nSeries4:Conolly,Donnell,Headly,Young\n\nSeries 5: \n\nSeries 7: Armstrong,Beatty,Cooney,Cooper,Dussault,Fulton,Gastmeyer(bat),Gastmeyer(catch),Gunderson,Ham,Hart,Irving,Kaiser,Kelly,Luyster,McCormac,McGeeham,Munson,Newman,Prim,Reeves,Schumaker,Sherrill,Simmons,Stoehr,Webb,Whelan,Wright\n\nSeries 8: Bayless,Berger,Hess,Lindsay,McCreery,McTigue,Newton,Rogers,Schopp,Seitz,Smith(Montgomery),Sweeney\n\nMost cards are in nice shape but there are a few turds in the punch bowl.
