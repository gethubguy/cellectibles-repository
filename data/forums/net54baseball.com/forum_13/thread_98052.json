      "post_content": "Posted By: Tony\nUp for sale are two different tobacco packs. The first is an opened box of Plow Boy tobacco with original foil pack included. Era unknown & contents are empty. Second is a real nice 1920'ish Honest Long Cut tobacco pack. This one still contains all the original tobacco inside. \nMay have been opened at one time or another. Very hard to tell. Seal is in tact and attached but no longer glued flat. Terrific condition with wonderful color. Looks like it was just bought off the local drug store shelf. $100.00 delivered takes them both. Email me at andreatny@qwest.net if interested. Thank you, Tony \n\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/plowboy1.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/plowboy2.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/plowboy3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack1.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack6.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack4.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/honestpack5.jpg[/IMG]",
