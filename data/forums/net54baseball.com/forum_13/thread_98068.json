      "post_content": "Posted By: Ed McCollum\nCard measures just slightly more than 1 7/16\" x slightly less than 2 5/8\". It's a beater. Rounded corners, heavy stains, multiple pin holes. Entire front surface of card has indentations/bumps that I liken to the surface of a golf ball. Sweet Cap 350-460 series back with scroll overstrike. Heavy staining and bumps on the back. Affordable example of the beautiful pastel Cobb. Asking $425. E-mail to buy or make offer. PayPal prefered. edmccollum@cox.net\n\n[URL=\"http://s150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/?action=view\u00a4t=Cobb_BatOff_Front.jpg\"][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/Cobb_BatOff_Front.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/?action=view\u00a4t=Cobb_BattOff_Back.jpg\"][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/Cobb_BattOff_Back.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nFrom the scans, you can't see the bumping/indentations. They are there, and they cover the entire surface of the front of the card. Small, less than 1/16th inch each, but they are everywhere.",
