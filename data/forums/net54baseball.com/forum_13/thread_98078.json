They come in their own carrying case with certificate of authenticity. I do want to note though that the case is pretty scuffed and the card's plastic holders are chipped as well. The cards are perfect though, you will probably want to find your own display method basically. They are comprised of a Piedmont 150 and 2 Piedmont 350/460 backs.\n\nSomewhere along the way I also picked up a Red Cobb which says \"Limited Edition #17\" and also has a certificate of authenticity. It has a Piedmont 350 back.\n\nThen finally, the mother load I am including is a nice 22 card HOF set with it's own custom wooden box, and each card is in a snap down, in perfect condition. Each of these is numbered #7 of 1,909 sets. It also includes a certificate of authenticity. The cards are a mix of Piedmont 350, Piedmont 350/460, and EPDG (in blue though).\n\nThe following cards are in this set:\n\nBaker\nBeckley\nBresnahan Batting\nBresnahan Portrait\nDuffy\nJohnson Portrait\nJohnson Pitching\nKeeler\nKeeler Portrait\nKelley\nLajoie Batting\nLajoie Throwing\nLajoie Portrait\nMcGraw Finger\nMcGraw Portrait\nMcGraw Glove at Hip\nMcGraw Portrait w/Cap\nPlank\nSpeaker\nWaddell Throwing\nWaddell Portrait\nWagner (Honus)\n\n2 Years ago I paid $170 shipped (will include original receipt) for the wooden boxed set alone, I will sell the whole kit-n-kaboodle above for $90 shipped.\n\nEmails have priority\ntrae@t206.org\n\nPayPal Preferred\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/porcelaint2061.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.t206.org/misc/porcelaint2062.jpg[/IMG]\n\n \n \n \n---\n\"There ain't much to being a ballplayer, if you're a ballplayer.\"\n-Honus Wagner",
