      "post_content": "Posted By: Ed McCollum\nCard measures 1 7/16\" x 2 5/8\". Surface breaking bend in upper left hand corner and across the middle, just below his mouth. Rounded corner, chipping and scuffing along the edges, along with spots. Back has a well centered El Principe de Gales back, missing an area about the size of a dime, from where it appears to have been attached to a scrapbook or something in the past. What appears to be a bit of old glue surrounds the area of paper loss. The erased numbers at the top of the card show much stronger in the scan than in real life. Card would be considered poor. Asking $260. Please e-mail to purchase or make an offer. PayPal preferred. edmccollum@cox.net \n\n\n[URL=\"http://s150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/?action=view\u00a4t=JohnsonFront.jpg\"][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/JohnsonFront.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/?action=view\u00a4t=JohnsonBack.jpg\"][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/JohnsonBack.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
