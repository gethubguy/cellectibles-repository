      "post_content": "Posted By: JP\nI bow down to Brian W. and am officially giving up on creating a T-206 Brown Hindu back set.  These cards are just in too high of demand for me to keep competing and overpaying just to get them.  So I've listed them on eBay, but am willing to pull any auction for Net54ers.  I've listed 18 so far\n\n[url]http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ25QQsassZjmpkcp[/url]\n\nbut will be listing 30 or so more over the next few weeks.  So e-mail me if you are interested in any of these Brown Hindus for now, and I'll add more as they come along.  Feel free to make any offer to jmpkcp@gmail.com but REMEMBER to make your offers MORE THAN 24 HOURS before the close of the auction so I can still pull them from eBay.\n\n(listed July 16, 2008)\nT206 HINDU CAD COLESPSA 1.5\nT206 HINDU CAD COLESPSA 1\nT206 HINDU ROY ELLAMPSA 1\nT206 HINDU TOM GUIHEENPSA 1\nT206 HINDU SHAG SHAUGHNESSYPSA 1\nT206 HINDU HUB PERDUEPSA 1\nT206 HINDU WILLIAM OTEYPSA 1\nT206 HINDU HUB PERDUEPSA 2\nT206 HINDU CHARLIE FRITZPSA 2 MK\nT206 HINDU BILL DAHLEN BOSTONPSA AUTH\nT206 HINDU MIKE DONLIN FIELDINGSGC AUTH\n\n(listed July 15, 2008)\nT206 DRUM VIC WILLIS (WITH BAT) SGC AUTHENTIC\nT206 HINDU AL SHAW PSA 5\nT206 HINDU BILL BRADLEY PORTRAITPSA 1\nT206 HINDU AL BRIDWELL (NO CAP) PSA 1\nT206 HINDU ELMER FLICKPSA 1\nT206 HINDU VIC WILLIS PITTSBURGSGC 30\nT206 HINDU SHERRY MAGEE PORTRAITSGC 40\nT206 HINDU ED REULBACH SGC 30\n\n(Coming later This Week)\n\nT206 HINDU ED REAGANPSA 1\nT206 HINDU GORDON HICKMANPSA 1\nT206 HINDU DUTCH JORDAN ATLANTAPSA 2\nT206 HINDU BILL CRANSTONPSA 2\nT206 HINDU PAT McCAULEYPSA 2\nT206 HINDU ARCH PERSONSPSA 3\nT206 HINDU WILLIAM OTEYPSA 3\nT206 HINDU DUTCH REVELLEPSA 3\nT206 HINDU CARLETON MOLESWORTHPSA 4\n\n\n\n(listed July 6, 2008)\nT206 Woodie Thornton PSA 3 MK (Brown Hindu) - SOLD\nT206 George Paige PSA 3 MK (Brown Hindu) - SOLD\nT206 J.F.

I think he's buried in Baldwin, KS (just south of Lawrence).  Someday I'd like to get up that way and view his grave marker.\n\nCraig",

The set is obviously a tough task and to think you could complete it in a month or two is ridiculous. I would not sell the cards you already have, just be patient and over time you can do it.",

      "post_content": "Posted By: JP\nRelaxing is exactly what I'm trying to do.  It had nothing to do with trying to finish the set in a month.  It more had to do with each opportunity to get one of these Hindus became a scramble.  There are so many people interested in rare backs at the moment, I'm having to pay a premium each time just to add a new one to my collection.  So I'd rather liquidate, step back, relax and rethink what I really want to do.  T-206s will always be my favorite set, but my timing on this Hindu back set may not have been the best.  \n\nI do appreciate the encouragement, though!\n\nRegards,\nJP",
