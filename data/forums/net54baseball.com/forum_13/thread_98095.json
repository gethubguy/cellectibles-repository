      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\n\nA solid VG-VG/EX card and should at least grade out as a \"40\" if not higher.  No wrinkling and only mild touches to the corners.  There does appear to be a printer's line running vertically on the card as well.  It shows up in the scan so I wanted people to know that's not a scratch or a crease.  Asking $60 delivered.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1216249653.JPG[/IMG]",
