      "post_content": "Posted By: Dustan Hedlin\nHey guys, I was going through my T206 Excel sheet tonight and noticed that I do not have any Polar Bear T206's in my collection.  I'd be open to the purchase of any Polar Bear backed T206's, but would prefer a Cubs player, since that is the first subset I am going for.  If I can't find a Cubs Polar Bear, I'll be open to others.  So far, here are the Cubs that I have.  Any others would do just fine.\n\nEvers Johnny W/ Bat,CHI\nMoran Pat\nNeedhamThomas \nOverallOrval Portrait\nPfefferFrancis\nPfeister Jake Seated\nReulbach Ed No Glove\nSchulteWildfire Back\nSchulteWildfire Front\nSheckard Jimmy Glove Show\nSteinfeldt Harry Portrait\nZimmerman Heinie",
