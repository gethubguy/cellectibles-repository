Each card has its problems but the price is right. I need $162 for the group, which includes shipping. There are two scarcer backs, Old Mill and Polar Bear.\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206afb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206arb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf you would like to buy them, you can contact me at:\n\ncy@cyscards.com\n\nThanks.\n\nCy\nwww.cyscards.com",
