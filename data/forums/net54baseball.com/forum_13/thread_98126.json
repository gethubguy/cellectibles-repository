I'm interested in VG/EX \"creaseless examples\" of catchers in these sets. Furthermore, I'm still hunting for catchers in the 1912 Zeenut and Home Run Kisses sets as well as the 1911 Obak set. Here's a link to my PCL collection to show you what I currently have already.\n\n[url]http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeqzw1e/thevintagecatcher/[/url]\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPatrick",
