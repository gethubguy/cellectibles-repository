      "post_content": "Posted By: Cat\nI got these cards in a large Mastro lot.  I believe the two cards that were graded AUTH are because the top edges are rough.  Perhaps if these cards were resubmitted they would get a numeric grade, but I am not not sure.  Today I am going to open it up for someone who wants them all for $370.  If no one wants them all, tomorrow morning I'll open it up, at the prices below for anyone who wants a single card.  The ungraded cards may not get a numeric grade, but I am happy to e-mail these scans so you can see for yourself.  I suspect they were not sent into get grades because of the front paperloss.  As you see them below is exactly how I received them from Mastro.  Shipping is included in price.  If you want insurance, I'll add that at cost.  First to say:  \"I'll take them\" in an e-mail gets them.\n\n\nPrices:\n\nBreitenstein SGC 30 - $85\nDunn - $45\nMcElveen SGC A- $55\nPurdue - SGC A - $65\nRossman - $45\nStreet SGC 30 - $80\nSummers - $45\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/5166/t2133fbt2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSummers is on the left:\n\n[IMG]http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/8533/t2133rom0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/3651/t213breitensteinfih7.jpg[/IMG]  [IMG]http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/5277/t213breitensteinrvf8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/1489/t213mcelveenfps3.jpg[/IMG]  [IMG]http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/7375/t213mcelveenreh1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/8681/t213perduefnk9.jpg[/IMG]  [IMG]http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/9287/t213perdueraw0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/7583/t213streetfsf6.jpg[/IMG]   [IMG]http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/412/t213streetral7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n________________\n\n[url]http://www.audiocomedy.net/soundboards/jacket.shtml[/url]",
