      "post_content": "Posted By: Dave Moriarty\nI am looking to sell the following cards so that I can increase the size of the engagement ring that I am planning on giving my girlfriend later this year.  Sorry that the cards are not scans, but my scanner scans the slabs and not the cards.  Please feel free to make any offer on the cards if you are interested and you think the price is too high.  Also, if you would like close up pictures of certain areas of the card, please let me know that too.  Thanks.\n\n1.
