      "post_content": "Posted By: Lance\nThis is the nicest T205 Cobb I have had in my hands. The scans do not justly represent the blazing colors on the front. 4 crisp corners and brilliant resolution! There is a small spot of paper loss or paper stuck to the lower right corner on the back. The entire border is there, but it looks faint. Guaranteed to be authentic. The card is slightly OVER-sized. Judge for yourself, ask me any questions you have, and make me an offer. \n\n[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/Cobbraw1002.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w153/bamacollection/Cobbraw1003.jpg[/IMG]",
