      "post_content": "Posted By: david Poses\nI have a Hindu Shag Shaughnessy for trade only- was graded GAI3 (I think undergraded). I have since cracked it out, so it is now raw. \n\nI want to trade down to a Piedmont or Old Mill Shag. \n\nWill only consider trades that include similar condition Shags with either of those backs. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to swap my card for yours and a few other SLers, but I'm open to non-SLers also. \n\nYou can see the card in its old GAI holder here:\n\n[URL=\"http://s268.photobucket.com/albums/jj16/sesop/?action=view&current=hindushaggai3.jpg\"][IMG]http://i268.photobucket.com/albums/jj16/sesop/hindushaggai3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nPlease email me with any trade ideas: davidp@krasdalefoods.com\n\nThanks",
