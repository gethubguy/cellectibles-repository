Ideally, I'd like to get one of almost every back, though I'm not married to notion of obtaining every last example. In addition to different backs, I've added two cards from Lionel Carter's collection, one PSA 7 (MC) and a couple Hall of Famers with not-so-common backs (Young glove showing/Tolstoi and Flick and Lajoie/Hindus).\n\nMy goal isn't the super rare or the \"ultra-high grade,\" though I certainly would welcome a chance at a Drum or a PSA 8. Basically, I'd like to hear what you have available for sale or trade. Listed below are the players I have, but just because a player is listed doesn't mean I wouldn't be interested in \"upgrading\" to something more unusual or tougher. I'd really like to add an American Beauty (either series), Carolina Brights, El Principe De Gales, Lenox and/or Uzit.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing what you might have available.\n\nRob\nwolfie51sb@aol.com\n\nCleveland players I have:\n\nNeal Ball\nTed Easterly\nElmer Flick\nWilbur Goode\nAddie Joss portrait\nAddie Joss pitching\nNap Lajoie portrait\nNap Lajoie throwing\nNap Lajoie with bat\nCy Young portrait\nCy Young glove shows\nCy Young bare hand shows",
