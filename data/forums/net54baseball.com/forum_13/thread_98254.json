      "post_content": "Posted By: John\nWonkaticket Auctions a trusted name in auctions since (about an hour ago), and one of the few that hasn\u2019t been served by the FBI lately.[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/piojohn3/smileys/77.gif[/IMG]\n\nPresents the following lot for potential sale\u2026\n\nLot # 1:\n\n1909-11 T206 \u201cWhite Border\u201d Partial Set of (154) cards:\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/piojohn3/ebay/huge/Webmass.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/piojohn3/ebay/huge/WebMass2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBreakdown of the lot includes (121) cards of popular major and minor league players from the dead ball era including notables such as Hal Chase and \u201cTurkey\u201d Mike Donlin, included here are also tougher cards of Reulbach, Lindaman, Lundgren (Chicago), Kleinow (Boston) and Ames (Hands at Chest). \n\nAlso included are (15) scarce \u201cSouthern League\u201d cards of Bastian, Bay, Breitenstein, Carey, Foster, Griminger, Howard, Kiernan, Manion, McCauley, Orth, Perdue, Reagan, Smith & Westlake. \n\n(18) Hall Of Fame players make this lot as well including those of Mathewson and Cobb (Bat off with \u201cPolar Bear\u201d back) the rest are Beckley (Polar back), Bender (port), Bender (No Trees), Brown (Cubs Chest), Chance (Red port), Chance (Yellow Port), Crawford (batting), Crawford (Throwing), Davis, Duffy, McGraw (Hip), Tinker (Hands on Knees), Tinker (Bat on Shoulder), Waddell (Port), Waddell (Throwing) & Wheat.\n\nBrands include Piedmont, Old Mill, Polar Bear, El Principe De Gales, Sweet Caporal & Cycle. All backs are clean with no back damage or major paper loss. The set overall is VG with some coming in VG-EX and EX and few lesser in G. Includes (6) graded cards (3) SGC 40\u2019s, (2) PSA 2\u2019s and one SGC 50. All cards are guaranteed original and will most likely all get numerical grades etc. All of these cards are extra\u2019s I\u2019m thinking of parting with most of which came from a large find of 800+ T206\u2019s I had as a kid close to 20yrs ago the cards came from an elderly mans collection.\n\nA full excel sheet of the breakdown of the cards can will be sent upon request also hi res scans of all cards are available at the URL below.\n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/piojohn3/wallpaper/wallpaperimages[/url]\n\n\nI\u2019d like to sell as a lot, at this time I\u2019m looking to breakout individual cards sorry. \n\nI\u2019m posting here first to let you guys have a chance to send offers if you\u2019re interested. Not sure what the magic number is but I will take no less than 5k if that helps after watching the past few lots go off in Huggins and others. If no offers come in within reason I may decide to have graded and consign to an auction house vs. selling raw here.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nCheers,\n\nJohn\n\nP.S. Catalogs are available for $77 dollars if needed if not quality web images will be provided\u2026.to the cheapskates I guess.",
