      "post_content": "Posted By: Bob\nJason- I have no clue why Schulte is so scarce. I know I have tried to find a nice upgrade for a couple of years and when a higher quality Schulte goes up for bid it gets crazy money. Both Tim N. and I when writing our articles on the T207 set noted the card is a tougher common, but based on how rarely the card comes up and the prices paid for it, I must assume either we have a Schulte relative buying at all costs or the card is just flat out scarcer than we all thought. Based on distribution there is no reason for this. I am stumped. Good luck though!\ntbob",

I have actually been looking for this card for more than a year now.  Everytime one comes up (agreed, very seldom), I am the underbidder.  You know why?  Because I cannot bring myself to pay more than I did for my Victor Saier (PSA 1)!!!!  No way was I under the impression that the Schulte was one of the tough Cubs cards.  I swallowed hard to get the Saier, and have since resigned myself to the fact that acquiring a Ward Miller will take a lottery win.  No way did I think I would need to wait this long and be so upwardly mobile in my price for a Schulte.\n\nI find your commentary both disheartening and encouraging at the same time.\nPerhaps something is at work behind the scenes, as you say.
