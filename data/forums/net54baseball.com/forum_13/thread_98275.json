Mathewson looks great for the grade, just a divet on the back that cuts through the bottom of the NY, but you don't notice it if just glancing at it.  The color and resolution are crisp.  You can see the twinkle in his eyes!\nDelivered prices:\nMathewson: No longer availible\nChance: SOLD\n\n\nThanks,\nBob\nemail at upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1218839726.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1218839713.JPG[/IMG]",
