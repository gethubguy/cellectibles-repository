Scott Fitzgerald. Also tagged as being from the Lionel Carter collection. Two great previous oweners.\n[URL=\"http://s150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/?action=view&current=Donohue.jpg\"][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/Donohue.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nLooking to trade for any t206 with Howe McCormick's rubber stamp on the back. If interested but don't have any of Howe's old cards, I can provide a list of cards I need to find in order to trade for cards once owned by McCormick. But I would rather just trade outright for any that might be lurking on the board. Let me know. edmccollum@cox.net. Thanks.",
