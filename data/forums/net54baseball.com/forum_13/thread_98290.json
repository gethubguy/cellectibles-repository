      "post_content": "Posted By: ali_lapoint\ni have 2 wonderful T3's for sale. one is a Hal Chase graded a 2.5 by GAI. card has absolutely no creases and is gorgeous for a 2.5. the Dygert is graded a PSA 4 with an MK qualifier. the mark is a number written extremely lightly in pencil on the back of the card. the Chase card has a checklist back with offer and the Dygert has the ad back. Dygert card is gorgeous as well and a more adventurous person could easil erase the pencil off the back and re-submit.\n\nChase: SOLD\n\nDygert: $350 obo\n\nscans available upon request.",
