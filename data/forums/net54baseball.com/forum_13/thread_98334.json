I am looking for PSA/SGC 5/60 or better in condition, but would also consider lesser grades for SLers and rarities.\n\nEmail:  SignedT206@gmail.com if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1219842714.JPG[/IMG] \n\nPublished in 1927 and designated W560 by the ACC, a number of multi-sport images were issued -- 49 of them featuring baseball players -- each measuring 1 3/4\" x 2 3/4\".  The graphics were either red and/or black in the theme of playing cards and the cards were blank on the reverse.\n\n_  _  _  _  _  _  _ _ \n\nVisit [url]http://www.t206collector.com[/url] for signed deadball card galleries, articles and more!",
