      "post_content": "Posted By: MVSNYC\na few months ago, someone had for sale a low-grade raw Elberfeld Wash Port. THAT exact card used to belong to me years ago...we even had a dialogue on here about it (the fact that i owned it before). anyway, i would now love the oppurtunity to buy it back. it had a pin hole at the top, and a scuff or mark at the bottom. i know this may be like trying to find a needle in a hay stack, but figured i'd give it a shot.\n\nthanks!\nMS",
