      "post_content": "Posted By: Iggy...\nThis LOT of T206 cards WAS SOLD!\n\nPrice for the lot is $225 which includes shipping. \nNO Paypal, unless you want to splilt the 3% fee, checks or money orders are fine. \n\nMy email is: agonzdude@yahoo.com.  \n\nAll fifteen cards have nice eye appeal but the backs have some flaws as seen on the pic's.  Mostly crease-free with the exception of corner creases on the Starr, F. Smith, Oakes, and Overall cards.  Bid with confidence and good luck!\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547622.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547634.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547652.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547661.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547672.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1220547681.JPG[/IMG] \n\nLovely Day...",
