When the SGC 80 comes in early this week they will sell the SGC 70.\n\nI really don't like the blind auction format and decided to equivocally pass on the card, not to bear in mind the presumptions that the card might not be sold in a transaction if the SGC 80 they are hoping to get is irretrievably lost and \nnot delivered to such address.\n\nThat's what I got.",

The Bruces will not be allowed to do this again without me knowing they have the card in their possession and/or own it, with no complications. As I said before I have no issue with folks doing these kinds of auctions but this one left much to be desired. \n\nBruces- Here is your polite warning. You may not do this kind of auction again until you and I chat privately (email or phone) and I am comfortable with the whole process. This is absolutely NOT personal.....Anyone that does this type of auction on our board will get the same scrutiny. I hope you understand....take care",

The winner of my N167 is a fairly private person and I would never out him. Many know who won it but I just don't think it's a good idea mandating winners be known...from where my head is on the matter today. ALso, I know Dave S. had a higher end auction too and I am pretty sure it went real well. I think it also goes back to trusting the seller/auctioneer. That \"trust\" has to be earned.....One last thing...>We have very few rules on the BST pages and I prefer to keep it that way.....Never hurts to give your opinion though and it is valued.....best regards",
