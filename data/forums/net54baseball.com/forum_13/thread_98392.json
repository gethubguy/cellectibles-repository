      "post_content": "Posted By: Bob\nleon- Good question. The cards with Cycle, Broadleaf and Anonymous Factory backs only are definitely not \"commons\" and are considered scarce. That leaves the cards which were only issued with Recruit and Napoleon backs. (For purposes of this discussion, the Anonymous Factory backs, I am at work and am forgetting the number of the Factory, which are issued hypothetically on any card, common or scarce are omitted). Of that group of Recruits and Napoleon backs only, the Napoleon back is a tough back, but if we are talking only about the fronts, that entire group is generally considered a common with a few exceptions. Graham, Ellis, Kling, George and Scott are 5 which come to mind immediately which are tough, and although \"commons,\" are hard to find, especially in nice shape. There are a few more I have forgotten off-hand (some consider Schulte tougher than normal among commons). \nWhat's particularly odd is that a few HOFers appear all the time (Marquard, etc.) Because HOFs can't technically be considered \"commons\" the general abundance of these cards must not be considered. \nSo, I would consider a T207 common one with a Recruit back, not a HOFer, and not one of the 6-7 toughies. Clear as mud? If we get in to the oddball Anonymous Factory back we really open up a can of worms which would take pages to detail [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Frohme\nBob has summarized it right on - as always.\n\nTim Newcomb's VCBC articles proposed that two series of the Recruit-class cards may have been printed - the second of which was 50 subjects.  The 100 remaining Recruit-class cards might be considered the \"commons\", though the list has a few cards that certainly aren't that easy. \n\nWhether that's the case or not, we may never know, but there are certainly degrees of difficulty in the Recruits - some of which are as hard or harder than a good # of the Broadleaf class subjects.  I also agree with Bob that the Anon Factory 3 and 25's are another matter altogether.\n\nHere's that list of the remaining 100 (w/out variations) - in increasing order of Tim's \"number of appearances\" (i.e. approximately hardest to easiest) in his 2002-2004 (if I recall) survey - read the articles for the details and what that number means...  its really good reading if you're into T207.\n\nCallahanNixey 28\nKnetzerElmer 28\nTooleyBert 29\nGowdyHank 30\nNorthenHub 30\nDanforthDave 34\nLappJack 34\nMillerDots 34\nScanlonBill 34\nSmithWally 34\nStackEddie 34\nStrunkAmos 34\nCollinsJohn35\nOakesRebel 35\nBargerCy 36\nDaubertJake 36\nMarsansArmando 36\nMorganCy 36\nPaskertDode 36\nSevereidHank 36\nWarhopJack 36\nBescherBob 37\nHallinanEd 37\nLordBris 37\nNeedhamTom 37\nO'TooleMarty 37\nStanageOscar 37\nErwinTex 38\nEvansLouis 38\nFrommeArt 38\nTannehillLee 38\nBarryJack 39\nCamnitzHowie 39\nClarkeTommy 39\nAinsmithEddie 40\nBradleyHugh 40\nDerrickClaud 40\nHenriksenOlaf 40\nMullinGeorge 40\nWilsonArt 40\nDavisHarry 41\nGoldenRoy 41\nGraneyJack 41\nMcIntireHarry 41\nO'BrienBuck 41\nSteinfeldtHarry 41\nBallNeal 42\nColeKing 42\nCoulsonBob 42\nKrauseHarry 42\nOldringRube 42\nVaughnHippo 42\nKalerGeorge 43\nReulbachEd 43\nDoyleLarry 44\nFisherRay 44\nLennoxEd 44\nTinkerJoe 44\nCareyMax 46\nFerryJack 46\nMcLeanLarry 46\nSimonMike 46\nWheatZack 46\nChanceFrank 47\nMoranPat 47\nGainorDel 48\nTurnerTerry 48\nKonetchyEd 49\nYerkesStanley 49\nAustinJimmy 50\nCrandallDoc 50\nHarmonBob 50\nLivingstonPaddy 50\nOlsonIvy 50\nFletcherArt 51\nGardnerLarry 51\nWolvertonHarry 51\nCovingtonTex 52\nWalkerDixie53\nLathamArlie 55\nMcBrideGeorge 55\nBeckerBeals 56\nMilanClyde 56\nBenderChief 57\nByrneBobby 57\nDevlinArt 57\nChalmersGeorge 59\nDevoreJosh 60\nDelahantyJim 61\nLivelyJack 61\nStreetGabby 61\nWilieDewey 64\nSchaeferGermany 66\nDooinRed 69\nWiltseHooks 69\nKnabeOtto 74\nMarquardRube 75\nBresnahanRoger 80\nMcGrawJohn 81\nJohnsonWalter 89",

Good to know it's still on the radar with some collectors.\n\nThe \"common\" debate:\n\nI think the term is ambiguous.  It could refer to common players or to common cards within the set.  Clearly there are no common Cycle backs in that second sense.  Most of the players found with Cycles are, however, common.  Maybe that's what the OP meant?",

That was what I thought when I posted the scan above of the back of Birmingham, who of course, didn't make the hall. \n\nI have also read Tim N's great article written on the subject(several times) so, while I haven't memorized the article, know that many of the scarcest cards also have the most common backs, as as well as Cycle, and other more difficult backs.....anyway, sorry about that....\n\n\nps...Mike- The Weaver has his own scan [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",

This set is fast becoming my favorite. There is mystery, rareness (compared to the monster) and back variation debates. \n\nI have just about completed my Red Sox subset (regardless of back) and there are upwards of 20 Red Sox in the set and only 4 are listed in the 100 \"common Recruit\" list posted above. Meaning the rest probably fall into the perceived tough Recruit series. \n\nTim, if your still reading, I would love to read your article(s). How could I go about finding them? Thanks in advance.",
