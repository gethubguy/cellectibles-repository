Meehan\nI have a recently graded high-end 1911 Turkey Red (T3) John McGraw PSA 5.5 available for sale or trade (this is the only one in the current PSA pop - with only two cards graded higher). Asking price is $6k.  I would also be interested in other hi-end T3's for trade (5's or 6's).  Please email me if you're interested.  I will send scans upon request.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nDennis",
