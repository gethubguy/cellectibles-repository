It was once glued to the inside of a trunk so the back has some paper loss..\n\n\nI also have a Davidson portrait with Tolstoi back graded 2.\n\nLooking for offers or trades for other T206 cards\n\n[IMG]http://pic20.picturetrail.com/VOL1427/6158972/12011588/175424348.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://pic20.picturetrail.com/VOL1427/6158972/12011588/175424385.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://pic20.picturetrail.com/VOL1427/6158972/12011588/175424438.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://pic20.picturetrail.com/VOL1427/6158972/12011588/175424435.jpg[/IMG]",
