Many of the ones listed here are exceptionally nice, and some could be candidates for grading (if you're so inclined, of course). This is a great opportunity to add a nice-condition, tough type card to your team collection or to fill in some holes on your Helmar set.\n\nAll of the images below were scanned with the stamp inside a sleeve, which was inside the top loader. I mention this because the colors on these are very vibrant, and the scans might not reflect this. If you'd like larger, higher-resolution scans of any stamp(s), just drop me an e-mail.\n\nE-mails take priority over posts. I'll be in and out all day but will answer all e-mails and reserve stamps in the order your e-mails are received. Payment by check or money order only. To make up for the no-PayPal delay, if we've done business before or I recognize you from the board, I'll ship your stamps the day after a sale in confirmed.\n\nThanks, Rob\nwolfie51sb@aol.com\n\n(All prices are delivered)\n\nDoyle, New York, Nat. -- Sold\nToney, Chicago, Nat. -- $32\nParent, Chicago, Am. -- $38\nJennings, Detroit, Am. -- Sold\nCree, New York, Am. -- $42\nBell, Brooklyn, Nat. -- Sold\nStreet, New York, Am. -- $30\nMullin, Detroit, Am. -- Sold\nPaskert, Philadelphia, Nat. -- Sold\nSullivan, Chicago, Am. -- $36\nNeedham, Chicago, Nat. -- $30\nRowan, Chicago, Nat. -- Sold\nSweeney, Boston, Nat. -- Sold\nBliss, St. Louis, Nat. -- Sold\nMowrey, St. Louis, Nat. -- $20\nBeck, Philadelphia, Nat. -- Sold\nRucker, Brooklyn, Nat. -- Sold\nHuggins, St. Louis, Nat. -- $38\nGrant, Cincinnati, Nat. -- $22\nTitus, Philadelphia, Nat. -- $26\nGaspar, Cincinnati, Nat. -- $18\nEvans, St. Louis, Nat. -- $26\n\n[IMG]http://members.aol.com/wolfie51sb/helmars1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://members.aol.com/wolfie51sb/helmars2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://members.aol.com/wolfie51sb/helmars3.jpg[/IMG]",
