I doubt I will be lowering the price on these, as they are already below what I paid! Thanks! Brandon\n\n[IMG]http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll6/BrownCow75/img067.jpg[/IMG]",

It is now Saturday and I have given you more than enough time to pay.  Also, I saw that since this purchase, you have purchased other items and paid for them.  Please let me know what is going on and why payment has not been made.\n-Dustin Thompson\n\nThank you for your time.\nDustin Thompson\njdtcards\ndustinthompson@comcast.net",
