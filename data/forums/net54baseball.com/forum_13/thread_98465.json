I'm willing to buy or trade for pretty much any player in any condition.  I'll trade generously and have a decent sized list of cards I could part with below.  \n\nThanks in advance!\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n\nt202 Bresnahan PSA 5 - $185\nt202 Hummell/Daubert PSA 6 - $200\nt212 1911 Obak O'Rourke PSA 3 - $90\nt212 1911 Obak Lamline PSA 4 - $135\nt212 1911 Obak Dillon PSA 4 - $135\ne98 McGraw GD corner wear WITH MISSING COLOR PALETTE -- $275\ne102 Schmidt SGC 20 (rare variation) - $575\ne103 Pastorious PSA 1 -- $300\ne103 Ewing SGC 20 -- $450\n1911 Zeenut Arlett SGC 80 -- $1100\n1911 Zeenut Brashear (Vernon) SGC 40 -- $125\n1911 Zeenut Byram (Sacramento) SGC 40 -- $125\n1911 Zeenut Cutshaw (Oakland) SGC 20 -- $65\n1911 Zeenut Fitzgerald (Sacramento) SGC 30 -- $75\nc46 O'Hara GD corner wear & light wrinkle -- $60\nd322 Forbes Field - $500 (trimmed and heavy back damage)\nm116 Demmitt SGC 50 (\"300 subjects\" back) - $80\nm116 Zwilling SGC 50 (\"300 subjects\" back) - $80\nw502 Group of five including Rixey & Peckinpaugh (HR back) - $150\nw519 Arbuckle EX -- $115\nw553 O'Doul GD wrinkling -- $140\ngroup of four w572s -- $45\nv117 Maple Crispette Mckechnie SGC 40 -- $165\n1928 Yeungling's Ice Cream Uhle SGC 50 -- $110",
