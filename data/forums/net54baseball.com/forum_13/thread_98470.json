      "post_content": "Posted By: Korey\nFor one of my community service requirements to keep my scholarship, I am spending one weekend a month driving back to my home town to help clean it up. It's a very rural area, old coal mining town and it's rather poor so not much upkeep has been done since I was a kid back in the late 80's.  Myself and a friend are working on cleaning up the community park and working on a \"Murray City History\" display for the municipal building. \n\nJosh Devore is one of two claims to fame my home town has. He was born there (the other is they are in the football hall of fame for the Murray City Tigers)...so I'd like to buy a couple cards to put into the display case.  Condition is not a factor, but I think the citizens might like to put a picture to the name.  Or even newspaper clippings, etc. I'm pretty open to what we could put in there.\n\nHere is a link to the only page about murray city on the web  (population 500 in rural SE ohio, so not many web savvy folk), in case anyone was interested. \n\n[url]http://www.ohgen.net/ohathens/murraycity.htm[/url] \n\n\nPlease email me with anything you have for sale and price.\n\nThanks!",
