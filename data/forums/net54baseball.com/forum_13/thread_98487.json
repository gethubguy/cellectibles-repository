      "post_content": "Posted By: Bill Kasel\nA few T Cards for sale to help fund a few other purchases.\n\nT205 Tinker - $100.00 - SOLD\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1221224672.JPG[/IMG] \n\n\nT206 Reagan MISCUT - $215.00 - SOLD\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1221224753.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe Rules:\n1. Emails have priority over posts.\n2. Emails have priority in the order received.\n3. An email stating an intent to purchase without conditions will take precedence over a prior email requesting a scan or attaching some other condition precedent to a firm commitment to purchase.\n5. If I provide a larger scan I expect a response, one way or the other. A simple \"thanks, but I'll pass\" would be great.\n6. Prices are for payment by check or money order and include shipping (but not insurance).\n7. NO PAYPAL ACCEPTED\n8. On purchases over $100 I recommend Insurance. Insurance is at the buyer\u2019s expense. The risk of loss shall pass to the buyer upon mailing.\n9. Personal checks must clear before shipping though if you have dealt with me before and/or are a recognizable VIP member of the board I\u2019ll ship on the next business day.\n10. No returns on graded cards. All others have a thirty (30) day full refund return privilege.\n\nThanks for looking!",
