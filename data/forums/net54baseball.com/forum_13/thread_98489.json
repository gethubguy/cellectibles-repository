This was the first card graded by SGC as such. To the best of anyone's knowledge there are fewer of these cards than Red Cross back t207s. Asking price is $999 shipped and insured. I am also open to trades involving t205s or Delongs I need.\n\n[IMG]http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh144/sabrjay/my%20collection/t207milan.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh144/sabrjay/my%20collection/t207milanb.jpg[/IMG]\nJay\n\nThe richest person is not the one who has the most, but the one who needs the least.",
