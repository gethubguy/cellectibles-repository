      "post_content": "Posted By: Jon Canfield\nRecently I came into a small grouping of Egyptienne Straights Cigarettes clam shell cigarette boxes.  The boxes range in condition from MT to VG-EX.  The one scanned below is the worse of the bunch so this will give you an idea of condition.  As you know, Egyptienne Straights were used in the distribution of B18 blankets albeit I believe these boxes to post-date the distribution on the blankets.\n\nPrice is $15.00 ea (+ $2.50 shipping) for a box (I have a few available).\n\nAlso, on my website I have a few other great boxes available including a Derby, unopened Pirate, unopened Recruit, etc:\n\n[url]http://www.baseballandtobacco.com/sale.htm[/url]\n\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view\u00a4t=esforsale.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/esforsale.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n======================================\nFor the premier online souce of information on baseball-related cigarette packs, visit [url]http://www.baseballandtobacco.com[/url]",
