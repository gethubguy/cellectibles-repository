The card is slightly offset top to bottom.  I am looking for around $1650 in value.  Shipping and insurance can be discussed.  If interested, please contact me at tbotticell@aol.com.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1223245140.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1223245269.JPG[/IMG]",
