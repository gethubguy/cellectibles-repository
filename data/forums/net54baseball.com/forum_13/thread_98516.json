      "post_content": "Posted By: Dustin\n     Looking to move these for tobacco cards.  Looking for bigger names (Cobb, Mathewson, Wagner, Johnson, etc.), and willing to take lower graded cards, but will consider any vintage cards.  The Clemente looks really nice and should probably be regraded.  The Williams is a nice display card with nice color, but has some creases.  Thanks, and email works best.\n\n1955 Topps ROBERTO CLEMENTE rc PSA 5 (looks better):\n[IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/clementercpsa5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/clementercpsa5back.jpg[/IMG]\n\n1949 Leaf TED WILLIAMS BVG 1.5\n[IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/49leafwilliams.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/49leafwilliamsback.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThank you for your time.\nDustin Thompson\njdtcards\ndustinthompson@comcast.net",
