Not sure what's on the card, but it looks similar to whatever is on the Nagy w/ the Cobb Back. It is not creased and is ungraded in my opinion, especially when compared to the Nagy which is an SGC 20.\n[IMG]http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd109/mjsilvey80/CobbRedF.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd109/mjsilvey80/CobbRedB.jpg[/IMG]",
