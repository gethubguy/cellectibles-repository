      "post_content": "Posted By: jay wolt\nRuss - not sure why it wasn't given a numerical grade.\nThere were 7 different Topps cards auctioned of by Hunt\nin NYC the day of the All Star Game at Yankee Stadium.\nWhich Ford, Reggie, Yogi & Goose threw out the 1st pitch.\n\nI doub't Ford had these cards in his collection slabbed.\nHunt probably had them slabbed w/ the pedigree as opposed to\nauctioning them in top loaders. Hunt also auctiond off a bunch\nof Whitey's plaques, awards & momentos.\n\nSince the '62 Ford is well worn, it really doesn't matter in\nvalue if its graded a 30 or authentic. Its not like Ford had \na dozen of each year, just 7 different Topps and a couple of\nBowmans.",
