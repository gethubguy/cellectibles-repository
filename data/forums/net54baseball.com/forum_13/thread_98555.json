      "post_content": "Posted By: Craig D\nHi,\n\nI have available for sale a very nice T3 Turkey Red of Big Ed Walsh.  The card is graded PSA-5(MK).  This is a very, very nice T3; beautiful bright colors, excellent focus, nice corners, etc. Unfortunately, someone circled 2 numbers on the checklist back (since erased), thus the MK.  Happy to send front and back scans. Easily one of the prettiest T3s.  \n\nI'd ask $1250 OBO, shipping and insurance included.\n\nThanks,\nCraig",
