Has small blue line at bottom where should be. Na trace of name plate at all on bottom. Card measures corrctly from side-side but is around 1/16\" or so short top-bottom. Has small pinhole in upper left corner area. Listening to reasonable offers for this card as I have no idea of what kind of value it may have. Email me with offers............\n[URL=\"http://s135.photobucket.com/albums/q127/bahbee61/?action=view&current=t206f.jpg\"][IMG]http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q127/bahbee61/t206f.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s135.photobucket.com/albums/q127/bahbee61/?action=view&current=t206b.jpg\"][IMG]http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q127/bahbee61/t206b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
