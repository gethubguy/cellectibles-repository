      "post_content": "Posted By: James Feagin\nOne of the more difficult T206 Cobb examples. Has a clean El Principe De Gales back. This cards has absolutely incredible eye appeal and has only a corner crease and soft corners as its only flaws. I'm asking $1500 for this card and it's only available until 9PM EST tonight. Paypal or money order.\nHere's a scan of the card when it resided in a PSA 3 holder. It has been since graded by SGC.\n\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/1910t206cobbepdg.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y203/brooksie05/epdgback.jpg[/IMG]",
