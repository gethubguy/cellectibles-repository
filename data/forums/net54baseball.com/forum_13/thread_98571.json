      "post_content": "Posted By: Rick McQuillan\nHi,\nI have 9 tobacco coupons for sale or trade.  $20 each includes shipping. I will provide insurance for orders over $60.  Paypal, money orders and personal checks are all OK.  I will also trade for raw T206 and T205 commons that would grade in the 1.5-2.5 range.\n\nSOLD\n\nThanks\nRick\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/piedmont.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/piedmontbacks.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/OM.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/OMbacks.jpg[/IMG]",
