I also have an Orth, but that is a PSA 2 ($70, shipping included).  \n\nYou could crack them out of the slabs and they would become raw!  \n\nPlease email me at aamoniz@yahoo.com if you have any interest.  I would also trade any for a T206 Ed Foster.\n\nGood luck with your search!\n\nRegards,\nAdam",
