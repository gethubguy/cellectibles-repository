      "post_content": "Posted By: B O'Brien\nI am working on a T206 backs lineup (including the 5 Chase cards) and now have two different Chase cards with the same back.\nI would like to trade either my Black Cap SGC 50 or Trophy Chase PSA 4 with Sov. 460 backs for the same pose, but with a back that I don't have.  I am looking for SGC 40-50's and can take or toss in some cash depending on the scarcity of your back and grade.\nLet me know if you have any interest and we can discuss.\nThanks,\nBob\nupperhandisforemost@yahoo.com",
