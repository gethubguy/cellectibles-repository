The PSA 2 and the SGC 40 look as if they could grade higher.  Email works best for contacting me.  Thanks.\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/CobbBatOff.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/CobbRed.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/CobbBatOn.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c3/jdtcards/CobbGreen.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n\nThank you for your time.\nDustin Thompson\njdtcards\ndustinthompson@comcast.net",
