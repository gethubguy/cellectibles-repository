Thanks also go out to those who sent me emails about how wonderful life is being a dad. My wife and I found out last Thursday that we are going to have a boy! Now we just have to agree on a name... although the name Denton has definitely grown on her over the weekend.\n\nThank you again. It's the people on this board that make this so much more than a hobby. [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Ray Piskadlo\nA quick update... I have about 10 people who have requested scans of numerous cards over the past two days. I have held cards for those people, giving them a chance to review the scans and make decisions. Unfortunately, I cannot wait for those people any longer. I have received 17 new emails today for scans as well.\n\nStarting immediately, each card will be sold to the first person who emails me saying they want it. I apologize to those who may miss out on a card because of this. I have tried to keep everyone in a specific order. But, in the end, I need to make sales and I have people waiting for scans/prices.\n\nThank you again for all the congrats up to this point! Maybe I'll post a picture of our ultrasound tomorrow! haha. \n\nAll the best,\nRay\n\nps... Shaughnessey is SOLD.\nCarrigan is SOLD.\nBastian, Greminger, Helm, Kiernan, King, Molesworth, Stark, and Thornton now SOLD\nDoyle NY, Doyle LENOX, Matty Dark and White caps SOLD!\nSteinfeldt EPDG SOLD.\nKling SOLD.\n\nI am removing names off the list above as cards sell to make it easier for potential buyers. Keep the emails coming. Still waiting on about 12 responses!",
