Rather tough card, I had waited a long time for this card and then won 2! Go figure. I paid $84.38 for it plus shipping but will let it go for $70 and I'll pick up the shipping. Paypal is fine. trophybob@sbcglobal.net\nThanks,\nBob\n\n[IMG]http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h233/trophybob/luckbrock.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h233/trophybob/luckbrock2.jpg[/IMG]",
