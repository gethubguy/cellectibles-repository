All cards are postage paid with insurance.  Paypal/Money Order/Checks are all fine with no fees.  These cards have seen better days (at least most of them):\nFirst e-mail takes priority over posts - I'll warn you I have a very aggressive Spam Filter so please be patient with that as well.\n\nT206:\nBack Damage so bad don't know the series-\nPiedmont:\n$9 Armbruster \n$9 Batch \n$9 Becker\nSweet Cap: \n$12 Burch (Batting)\n\nSweet Cap 150:\n$11 Bates\n$13 Mullin (Horizontal)\n$12 Oldring\n\nSweet Cap 350:\n$11 Casey\n$14 Beck\n$11 Atz\n$11 Brain\n$11 Abstein\n$10 Barry (Milw)\n$10 Beaumont\n\nSweet Cap 350-460\n$11 Camnitz (Side View)\n$10 Abbaticchio (Blue)\n\nPiedmont 150:\n$14 Birmingham (Bk Damage and punch hole)\n$11 Camnitz (Folded)\n$15 Ames (Port)\n$11 Abbatcchio (Brown)\n$11 Bridwell (Port no cap)\n$6 Brown (Chicago - trimmed way short)\n\nPiedmont 350-460:\n$9 Bridwell (Port Cap- punch hole)\n$11 Bell (follow-through)\n\nRare backs\nSovereign:\n$15 Bransfield 150\n$13 Bergen (batting - scrap book paper coves series)???\n$13 Byrne 350\n$13 Burch (fielding)350\n$15 Chase (dark cap throwing - pin hole & tape)350 \n$15 Smith (white cap) 350\n\nPolar Bear:\n$14 Abbott\n$14 Barry (A's)\n\nCycle 350:\n$17 Burke\n$20 McAleese\n\nOld Mill (SL)\n$20 Breitenstein (Back held together by tape)\n\nTolstoi:\n$17 Ford\n\nEPDG:\n$20 Bliss",

I am just trying to raise money to make a few purchases while at the same time tightening up my collection to only include graded cards.  As far as Hal Chase being a Hall of Famer or not that is a question for the main board.  Thanks for the interest- I am also reducing the prices but feel free to make offers.",
