      "post_content": "Posted By: Derek\n OK guys - my apologies to all who sent out a request. I got so many that I started to assemble requests in order of when received. As of Sunday night, I had almost half spoken for. Then my wife came in and caught me and surprised the hell out of me. She wouldn't \"let\" me sell me cards. This is the same woman who has been complaining about my card purchases over the years. She said that no matter how tight things get financially, she couldn't see me parting with cards that I have had since I was 12. So, that being said, i apologize not being able to honor the requests that I set in motion. Sorry to for any confusion I may have caused, and for not writing back to each and everyone of you as I intended. I hope you all understand!\nDerek",
