      "post_content": "Posted By: Jimi\nTurns out I am going to need to sell off my T222 set.  I have 39 of the cards with most HOFers, a few SPs, and I believe 10 of them are SGC 40s.  I haven't thought up a firm price yet, but I thought I'd let you all know before I put on eBay or an auction house.  I'm not in emergency mode here or anything, but I can use the cash for a few things.  I am really wanting to sell this is a lot only.  Let me know if you'd like more detail and if you are at all interested.  Thanks!\n\nJimi",

I didn't really need the money from the set, so perhaps I will begin selling off some other things that are less important.  Thanks for the e-mails, guys!\n\nJimi",

Stick with it Jimi!\n\n\nHowever, this is the second time in two days this has happened on this board. Maybe we should set up a \"Perhaps I Want to B/S/T\" Board. \n\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]",

When you think about what you can get for the lot and how hard sets can be to complete when they are in the final stretch, things can get depressing or I can become eager.  [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]  I need to stay focused on this set...but I'm nervous about ever obtaining the Johnson SP.  \n\nThanks again everyone, especially to those who have helped along the way:  Brian McQueen, Dan Studebaker, Bill Cornell, Mike Peich, Dick Cariss, Darren Duet, Gerard McManus, Mike Frohme, Baggers, and a couple of EBay purchases.  \n\n\n\nJimi",
