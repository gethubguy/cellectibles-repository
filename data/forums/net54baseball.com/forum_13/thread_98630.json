Those are no big deal to find.\n\nHowever, the Hoblitzell No Stats still eludes us. We are considering using the best card in our set to help us finish what has been a fun and educational journey. \n\nObviously a low grade Hoblitzell would be fine. Testing the waters for the right deal. \n\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt and Turner\n\n\n[URL=\"http://imageshack.us\"][IMG]http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/4908/scan0011kz4.jpg[/IMG][/URL]<br",
