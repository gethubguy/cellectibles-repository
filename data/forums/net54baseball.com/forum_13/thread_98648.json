The wrinkles don't show up in the scan and the one by his collar can't even be seen when looking at the card until you tilt it in the light. Neither one of the wrinkles is a crease which goes through the card and can be seen on the back of the card.\n\n SOLD THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE WHO INQUIRED>\n\nThanks,\nTim Kindlerhttp://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1225149453.JPG [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1225149453.JPG[/IMG]",
