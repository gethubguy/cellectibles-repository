I just upgraded to a PSA-4.5 and I can tell you that this card is very close to it.  The only issues are some very light areas of creasing in the upper right corner and the lsightest bit of toning on the back.\n\nThe colors, clarity and focus are perfect, the corners are nice and square.  Just a beautiful front.  The Turkey Red Ad back is excellent as well.  It's really a beauty.\n\nThe card was submitted for grading way before the half-point system started. It certainly deserves a higher grade.\n\nI know prices have softened for T3s a bit, but this card is a keeper for your collection.  If you have a budget for T3s and want a nice one, here you go.  I'm asking $325 for the card, including shipping.\n\nIf you're considering this for your T3 set, your type collection, Boston or Cleveland collection, or just want a little taste of Turkey Red, buy this one.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1226176341.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1226176361.JPG[/IMG]",
