      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Taylor\nHello All,\n\nIn order to make more substantial progress on my SGC graded T-205 master set I am offering up the following lot of cards for sale to any interested party.  The players included are as follows:\n\nChalmers\nCrandall\nDavis (Brown 'C' On Cap)\nDerrick\nDevore\nFerry\nKnabe\nKrause\nLatham\nMarquard (HOF)\nMcLean\nOldring\nO'Toole\nScanlon\nSnodgrass\nSpratt\nSteinfeldt\nWilie\nWilson\nWiltse\n\nAll backs are Recruit (all black ink unfortunately!).  The condition of the cards are generally nice with most having either the surface cracking or diamond cuts common to this issue.  Scans for your perusal are available at the following link:\n\n[url]http://s437.photobucket.com/albums/qq91/OriginalTrekkerMike/T-207s%20For%20Sale[/url]/\n\nMy asking price for the lot is $550 including insured shipping.  Acceptable forms of payment are PayPal (add 3% to the above total to cover fees), money order or personal check (cards will be shipped when the check clears).  The first email to say 'I'll take them' gets them.  Thanks for your time and consideration.\n\nP.S. I am not interested in breaking up the lot at this time.",
