I'm guessing the &quot;A&quot; is because of the odd cut, because this stamp measures the same as others that were given a numeric grade by SGC. Regardless, it looks nice, especially in the holder, and it's a HOFer of a somewhat tough issue. Check or money order, and if I recognize you from the board I'll ship the day after we reach a deal to make up for the no-PayPal delay.\n\n\n\n(P.S. I do not anticipate a bump with a lower price in the next 8-12 hours.)\n\n\n\nThanks, Rob\n\nwolfie51sb@aol.com\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i496.photobucket.com/albums/rr327/wolfie51sb/t332rube.jpg[/IMG]",
