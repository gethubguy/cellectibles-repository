      "post_content": "Posted By: Ken McMillan\nFor sale 2 T207 cubs.  I have Edward Reulbach in SGC 20  fair condition and Edgar Lennox in SGC 20 fair condition.  Both are recruit backs with clean backs.  Corners are slightly rounded on the Reulbach.  Slight visible crease on the lower front of the Lennox.  With that said, still very nice for 96 year old cards.  Reasonably priced at $50.00 each.  Scans available to interested parties. Would also consider trades for E121 series of 80 Yankees.  Paypal or money order please.  E-mail me at cubkmac32@aol.com.\n\nKen",
