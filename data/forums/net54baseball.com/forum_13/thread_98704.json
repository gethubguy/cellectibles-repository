I am at about 40% of each set, so I still need a lot of commons.  Feel free to make offers.  I will respond to all emails.  Try me - I'm easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nScans of my trade bait are below.\n\n\n\nBOTH OF THE T207'S AND THE MANTLE HAVE BEEN TRADED.  THE T205 MILAN AND THE T206 KROH HAVE BEEN TRADED. The CJ has been traded.\n\n\n\nI still have the 2 T206's - Abbott and Congalton, the Exhibit, and the W card.\n\n\n\n\n\nrickmcquillan@gmail.com\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\nRick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/N54%20selling/Tstrade.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/N54%20selling/Tstradeback.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/N54%20selling/Tradebait.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/N54%20selling/stan.jpg[/IMG]",
