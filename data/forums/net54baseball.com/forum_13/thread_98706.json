      "post_content": "Posted By: Iggy...\nI have the following raw T201 Ty Cobb / Sam Crawford card.  Price with shipping is SOLD $225 (SOLD!)...  \n\n\n\nThe card grades in the Good to Fair range, with a nice visual appearance on the front and decent corners.  The main problem with the card is a heavy horizontal crease/bend on the bottom portion of the card.  The crease/bend has started to tear the card on the back side but it is still intact on the front.  The tear is noticeable on the back but not on the front.    Otherwise, the card has a small crease in upper right corner but no other creases.  \n\n\n\nPaypal, check, money order, or all three will gladly be accepted. Thank you and good luck with your bids. \n\n\n\nMy email address is: agonzdude@yahoo.com \n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/3/9/9/9/7/7/webimg/194849234_o.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/3/9/9/9/7/7/webimg/194849286_o.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\nLovely Day...",
