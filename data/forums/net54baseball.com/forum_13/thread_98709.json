      "post_content": "Posted By: T206Collector\nIn 2001, Mastro auctions listed the following lot of 32 signed pre-war cards:\n\nThis is a phenomenal lot of some great early turn-of-the-century stars and famous Hall of Famers - some in quantity!! They include: Tris Speaker, Wahoo Sam Crawford (2 different), Ed Walsh, Zack Wheat (3 - one T-206, 2- T205), Fred Clarke, Elmer Flick, George Sisler, Rube Marquard (5), Heinie Zimmerman, Donnie Bush, Barbsau, George McBride, Hans Lobert(2), Fred Snodgrass, Chief Meyers, Russell Blackburne(2), Jack Warhop(pitched Babe Ruth's 1st homer!), Fred Parent, Gavvy Cravath(home run king!), Bill Carrigan, Geo. Wiltse, Hoblitzell, Larry Doyle. All signed in bold pen. Cards are basically VG. The greatest array of early signed baseball cards we have seen! Signatures are overall near mint with a couple of lighter ones.\n\n[url]http://www.mastroauctions.com/index.cfm?action=DisplayContent&ContentName=Lot%20Information&LotIndex=12315[/url]\n\nUnfortunately, I have not seen even a scan of a signed Zimmerman, Bush, Lobert, Blackburne, Cravath or Wiltse.  \n\nIf you have any information on the whereabouts of any of these cards PLEASE let me know.  And, as always, I am interested in acquiring any autographed pre-war cards you may be interested in parting with.  \n\nPlease email SignedT206@gmail.com with scans, offers -- or just information!\n\n\n\n_  _  _  _  _  _  _ _ \n\nVisit [url]http://www.t206collector.com[/url] for Net54 T206 archive, signed deadball card galleries, articles and more!",
