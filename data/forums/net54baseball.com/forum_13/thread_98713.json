Any chance anyone out there has any of the following cards available for sale?  \n\nI don't want anything super high grade, just something presentable without any major creasing or serious paper loss, if possible.\n\nPlease email me at richard@richardarmstrong.ca, with scans and asking prices.\n\nHere's what I am still looking for:\n\nC462Jim McGinley\nC4627Joe Kelley\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.\n\nEdited to reflect 1 pickup so far.  Thanks Dan!\nEdited to reflect another pickup.  Thanks Bill!\nEdited to reflect another pickup.  Thanks Mike!\n\n(Also removed references to T212 Victoria cards; gonna stick with the C46s only)",

Anyone out there have a McGinley or Delehanty they'd be willing to deal?  If it's a type in your collection, I'd be more than willing to buy you a replacement type.\n\nThanks guys!\n\nRichard.",
