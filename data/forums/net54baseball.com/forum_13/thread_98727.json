      "post_content": "Posted By: Josh C.\nVery much would like to get a couple of of the Piedmont Series 350-460 Factory 42's.  Preferably graded, but as long as you can vouch for the card(s) authenticity and freedom from alterations I would take those too.\n\n\nI also would rather lower grade cards that have decent or better eye appeal- I'm not in the market for high grade copies of these.\n\n\n\nHOF'ers obviously are always nice but even lower tier guys I would like to buy or trade for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best would be \n\nMcGraw (either pose)\n\nChance\n\nCrawford\n\nEvers\n\nJennings \n\nJoss\n\nLajoie\n\nWillis\n\nMarquard\n\nMathewson \n\nI have some pretty good stuff like an Evers T206 Cubs PSA 3, and a few other goodies.)\n\n\n\n\nPlease email me if you have any available with- if at all possible- a clear scan or pic of front and back and a price and/or trade value.\n\n\njoshr90@gmail.com\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n-Josh",
