Credit card bill is coming due.\nI am still holding on to Cobb (Red, SGC 20), Elberfeld (Washington, fielding, SGC 30), Kleinow (Boston catching SGC 30) and Evers (Chicago SGC 70 would be NM-MT but very nearly miscut), but would be willing to listen to offers.\nThanks,\nBob\nupperhandisforemost@yahoo.com",
