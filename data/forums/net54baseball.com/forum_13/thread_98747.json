They are actually pretty close. When you have cheated, tried to cheat, or shilled one of them, others take it as a personal offense. \n\nIf you don't like that, I suggest you make amends with those you have wronged. I realize that multiple Ebay names, and fake shill bidders will make that a difficult job. But until then, each time you come on here and try to sell, expect a response from someone.",

There are a few threads on the main board here, with the same kind of info. \n\n\n\nYou used to shill, but now you don't? \n\n\n\nYou used to have multiple ebay names, but now you don't? \n\n\n\nYou used to take money and not ship the goods, but now...?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI won't ignore your attempts to use this board to swindle board members. I'm sure you've done some good deals, but you've also done some bad ones. Expect that each time you post something to sell, I will either post a warning, or I'll email the potential buyer. \n\n\n\nGuess you should have settled with Mark Finn over a year ago, shouldn't you?",
