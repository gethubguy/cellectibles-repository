      "post_content": "Posted By: David R\nI have a T206 Karger with an EPDG back graded SGC 50 available for trade.  Karger with an EPDG back is very scarce. There are only two graded by SGC and the other one is an SGC 10.  \n\nI am looking for a HOFer with an EPDG, American Beauty 460, or Cycle 460 back, or a Mordecai Brown portrait (need not be a scarce back).  \n\nPlease email for scans if interested; I can't get them to post here.",
