I sold the ungraded one on eBay last week, but the customer returned it because he thought it might be trimmed. He was hoping to get it graded as a PSA 5 or better. The card measures fine there are no marks, scratches, or paper loss and the corners are decent. The print on the back of the card is a little off centered, but so is the graded one. I don't see any bat ears or signs of tampering, but I could be wrong. I'm including scans of both cards and prices and I will keep them listed here until Monday. I only want to sell one of them, and since they are both nice cards I don't care which one I keep. If they don't sell I will put one of them for sale on eBay next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGC50 Price SOLD!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/003-50.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/005-39.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUngraded Price $95.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/001-48.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m10/northviewcats/002-43.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice looking cards. Emails take precedence over posts. I will pay the postage, Paypal add 3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe",
