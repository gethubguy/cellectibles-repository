      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\n\nTerrific looking card with a neat printing gaffe.  09 Obak horizontals are some of the more popular cards in a very popular set to begin with.  This one has a ghosted &quot;imprint&quot; of the player on the front to make it really unique as well.  \n\nCondition-wise, the card is in VG/EX condition.  No wrinkling or creasing and only slight touches to the corners.  Image is crisp and clean and the back is perfectly clean and damage free.\n\nLooking to trade primarily for 1911 Zeenuts I'm still needing so please email me if you have extras.  I'd also consider selling the card for $425 if anyone wanted to go that route.  I have a scan available upon request.  Would have put it up here but Net 54 appears to be experiencing some issues right now.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",
