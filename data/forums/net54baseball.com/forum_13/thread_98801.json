      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhys\nI have available a signed document from Percival S. Hill.  He was Vice President of the American Tobacco Company and the heir appearant to Duke during all of the T card years and after the ATC was broken up in 1912 he became the companies president until the 1920's.  He obviously had a great deal of influence over the decisions to include baseball cards in packs and cease the operation after the breakup etc.  It is very likely he made many of the decisions regarding the cards that we now debate today including everyones favorite T206 cards.  \n\nThe offered document is a single page 1894 boarding school admission form for his son George W. Hill (who later succeeded him as President of the company after his death).  It is completely filled out in the hand of Percival Hill and boldly signed at the bottom.  From the estate of his famous son and only 2 signatures of Percival were in the entire collection!\n\nI will try and get a scan up as soon as possible.\n\n$150",
