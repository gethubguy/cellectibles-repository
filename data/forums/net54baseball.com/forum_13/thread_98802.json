      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Navarro\nI've received a few $$$$ offers on my T3 Ty Cobb, but nothing that has moved me to sell it.  Have it listed on ebay as well and if it sells, of course I won't have it to trade.  If I can find a trade though, I'll kill the ebay listing.   Card is crummy condition as you can see.   \n\nLet's try the trade route as there are some cards that I need in order to get them signed for my HOF signed rookie collection.     The following are the ones that I need and I will entertain trade proposals concerning them individually and/or in combination depending on condition.  I prefer multiple ones in low grade as opposed to one higher grade example. \n\n1948 Bowman Yogi Berra\n1949 Bowman Duke Snider\n1957 Topps Bill Russell\n1958 Topps Bobby Hull\n\nHere's the T3 Cobb,\n \n[IMG][IMG]http://i34.tinypic.com/2u77hgo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/2ii9wuo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG] \n\nTake care,\nMike",
