If there are no takers on a trade then I would consider selling them.\n\nWyatt Lee SGC 30\nJames Phelan SGC 40\nFrank Baker SGC 20\n\nAll three cards have high resolution scans on my registry. Registry shows most of the cards I do have. (Some are being crossed but I'll let you know if I have said cards)\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=33&userset=2697[/url]#\n\nThanks for looking.",
