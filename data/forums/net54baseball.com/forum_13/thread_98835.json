      "post_content": "Posted By: Rob D.\nLot of 12 T332 Helmar stamps that as a group are in above-average condition for the isssue. Includes:\n\nHuggins, St. Louis, Nat. (HOF)\nGrant, Cincinnati, Nat.\nMowrey, St. Louis, Nat. (2)\nNeedham, Chicago, Nat.\nSullivan, Chicago, Am.\nToney, Chicago, Nat.\nParent, Chicago, Am.\nEvans, St. Louis, Nat.\nStreet, New York, Am.\nGaspar, Cincinnati, Nat.\nTitus, Philadelphia, Nat.\n\nThe group is pictured below. If you'd like larger, hi-res scans of any individual stamp(s), just ask and I'll post or e-mail them.\n\nPrice is $175 delivered, and I don't anticipate any bumps for price reductions (at least not in the next 3 hours). Check or money order only. If I recognize you from the board, I'll ship the next day or two after we reach a deal to make up for the no-PayPal delay.\n\n(As a side note: Helmars are a pretty fragile issue, and this is one of the reasons I always shied away from them. However, after I picked up one for my Lajoie collection, I decided to get it graded by SGC, more to protect it than for the grade. Even without paying the extra money for the custom holder, I've got to say that Helmars look really nice in the holders. Apologies in advance for those who find that repulsive.)\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\nwolfie51sb@aol.com\n\n[IMG]http://i496.photobucket.com/albums/rr327/wolfie51sb/12helmars.jpg[/IMG]",
