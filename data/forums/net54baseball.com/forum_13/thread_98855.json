Might spend the rest of my life doing this...heh.\n\nI know that at least 15 players from the t210-3 set have been found the orange borders, these are listed below --\n\nBlanding, Burch, Curry, Firestein, Gordon, Hooks, Johnston, Jones, Leidy, Nagel, Northen, Slaven, Stringer, Thebo, Yantz.\n\nOf these 15, I still need the following -\n\nBurch, Gordon, Johnston, Nagel, Thebo, Yantz\n\nIn addition, any player that's not on that list of 15 is another card I would need.  I'd also appreciate hearing from anyone who's seen a t210-3 orange bordered card not listed above so at least I'll know that it exists.\n\nPaying very well and condition is not important to me.  Really beat cards are perfectly fine.  Thanks guys!\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",
