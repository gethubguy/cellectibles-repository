      "post_content": "Posted By: Russ Bright\nNo interest? How about at $700? This cost me more than a Grand for all of these and it's a nice chunk out of the T205 set - the Best lot of back variations you're likely to find for T205 ANYWHERE - start your rare back collection - \n\nand seeing how SERIOUS I am about selling these and DESPARATE to get some cash for the holidays so I can get presents for my kids, Buy it for $750 and I'll throw in my SGC10 Hans Lobert BROADLEAF back - That's almost the complete back set (save Hindu Drum and Blank, which will cost you a ton anyways) Sell off the Short prints, whatever. I could make more selling these one at a time on Ebay, but I really do't want to pay any more of their fees\n\nambrosia2@hotmail.com",
