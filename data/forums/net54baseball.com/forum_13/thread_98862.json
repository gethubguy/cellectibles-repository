      "post_content": "Posted By: Ken McMillan\nHello,\n\n\nI have 2 T207 cubs available.  I am asking $40.00 each for the cards or will consider trades.  As far as trades, I would consider E121 series 0f 80 yankees or series of 120 or 80 New York Giants, Elmer Miller cards of any variety, or t213-2 type cards.  Scans of cards can be seen below.  Both cards are SGC graded 20 fair 1.5.  Sorry for the small scans.  Scanner issues.\n\n[IMG]http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii52/kmac32_2008/th_IMG_0001.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii52/kmac32_2008/th_IMG_0002.jpg[/IMG]\n\nbacks are clean and are both recruit backs and nice for the grade.\n\nE-mail at cubkmac32@aol.com   \n\n\n\nThanks, \n\nKmac",
