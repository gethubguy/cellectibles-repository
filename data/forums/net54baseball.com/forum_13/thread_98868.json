Beautiful for the grade.\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-086b.jpg\"] 86 Jack Chesbro\nPrice: $230\nBack: Piedmont 150[/URL]\n\nMatty Dark Cap is in lower grade. But it is an inexpensive way to get a Matty with an Old Mill back.\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-2981b.jpg\"] 298 Christy Mathewson(Dark)\nPrice: $200\nBack: Old Mill[/URL]\n\nDunn is a nice VG-Ex card. This is a difficult card to find. Horizontal? No one knows for sure.\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-149b.jpg\"] 149 Jack Dunn(Balt)\nPrice: $50\nBack: Piedmont 350[/URL]\n\nMurphy is a tough true horizontal. It is stained buy uncreased. The price is right for this card.\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-342b.jpg\"] 342 Danny Murphy(Throwing)\nPrice: $35\nBack: Piedmont 150[/URL]\n\nIf you would like to buy any or all of these, you can send me an E-mail at:\n\ncy@cyscards.com\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nCy\nwww.cyscards.com",
