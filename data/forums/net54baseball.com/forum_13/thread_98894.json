      "post_content": "Posted By: Craig D\nThanks for looking.\n\nHere is a beautiful T3 Turkey Red cabinet of Big Ed Walsh.  Easily one of my favorites from the set.  How cool is that white belt!  Bright bold colors and excellent focus and clarity.  As for the MK, someone circled and erased the nunbers 106 and 125 on the back.  That's all.  Otherwise a gorgeous card.  I'd like to get $1100 for the card.\n\nIf you're collecting or thinking of collecting T3s, please let me know as I currently have several duplicates, including some of the rarities like Rhoades, Doolin, Out at Third, Bescher and A close Play at Second.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1229569265.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1229569327.JPG[/IMG]",
