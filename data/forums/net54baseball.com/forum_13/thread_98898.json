SGC 50 but appears much nicer! the only flaw I can find is a small flake on the left back border. Classic case of buy the card not the holder. \n\n$75 delivered \n\nScott \n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3842279-img252.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3842280-img253.jpg[/IMG]",
