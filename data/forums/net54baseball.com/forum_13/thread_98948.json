I need to add some more backs to the HOF line, with Carolina Brights being the one basic back I need and just started rounding out some factories and series cards.  This is the only card that I have a scan of and I don't have back scan, so it is the one for sale or trade for a Carolina Brights HOFer in VG-VGEX.  The white dot was on the case, not the card.\n\nSOLD SOLD  $1000 delivered and insured.  SOLD SOLD\nThanks,\nBob\nupperhandisforemost@yahoo.com\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1230563519.JPG[/IMG]",
