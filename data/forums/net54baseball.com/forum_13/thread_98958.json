My sister and I are trying to finish off, or as closely as we can, a set that an old man (our Dad) started about 50 years ago. We are going to present it to him this Xmas.\n\nWe have made a lot of progrees as we started with only 14 cards from his original collection (someone stole most of it from him). We have acquired 300 cards.\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of what we still need. We are definately looking for off grade cards as we cannot afford anything nice. We only have a few weeks left.\n\n\n\nThanks for looking,  Bob\n\n\n\n\n\n1909-1911 T206 Needs: Any condition.

As I explained to Chuck Paris, our greatest benefactor, we started less than 2 years ago with 14 cards remaining from a collection that had been stolen from our Father.\nWell 5 days ago we presented the old man with 461 T206 cards. It was the first time I'd ever seen him cry.\nIt definately would not have happened were it not for the kindness of some of the people in this forum.\n\nThank you, Bob\n\nPS, Dad has given us permission to continue this journey, (not sure how much time we have). But on the chance you have any of these we are still going to work on this. Happy to buy or trade:\n\n1909-1911 T206 Needs: Any condition.
