Since I have two Convenient Sensible and two No Paste Used, I can trade either Ort or H.Smith .... and either Brinker or Burrell.  I also have two 1911 Obaks available to trade... Cooney and McArdle.\n\nHere are the back slogans I need ...\n\nAlways a Pleasure \nCigarettes of Quality \nDelicate Aromatic \nFor Exacting Smokers \nHigh Quality \nImmensley Popular \nInstantly Popular \nMais Paper Wrapper \nMarvelous Blend \nMild and Pure \nNothing Like Them \nPerfect Aroma \nStand the Test \nSurpass Imagination \nThe Story in the Smoking \n\nNote that the order is reversed from front to back (the left front matches the right back) in each row.
