While no Hall of Famers are included, there are some Southern Leaguers, minor stars, and a few tougher backs.  The cards average in the Good to Very Good range, with some better and some worse.\n\n48 of the cards have been graded by SGC, 1 has been graded by Global, and all the rest remain ungraded.\n\nI am offering them here as one group, and looking for the best offer over $4,000.  I prefer checks or money orders.\n\nFor more information on the group, and some representative scans, please visit my web page at [URL=\"http://www.swingbattaswing.com/page2/page2.html\"]http://www.swingbattaswing.com/page2/page2.html>\n\n\n\nThanks for your interest.\n\n\n\n-Al[/URL]",
