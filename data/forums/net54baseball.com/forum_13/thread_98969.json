      "post_content": "Posted By: rob\nHi all,\n\nI am selling three different t206 lots. I have done my best with the scans, so if you have additional questions please ask. I consider myself pretty experienced with t206s and have grouped the cards according to how I think they would grade. Naturally there will be some better or worse in each group, but I hoped to keep them as homogeneous as possible. I have made additional comments to help as well.\n\nPlease ask any questions about individual cards you may have.\n\nthanks - Rob\nrgutheil@gmail.com\n\nOk, here we go:\n\nLot 1 - VG/EX (a couple as good as EX) - $560 (comes out to $40 per card)\n\nQuinn is VG\nBacks are all Sweet Caporal\nNo card would be downgraded by any back issues.\nVery nice group overall\n\n[IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/sc01975f67.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nLot 2 - VG for the most part, again some will be vg/ex and some good, but mostly vg - $896 ($32 per card)\n\nFletcher - initials in pencil on top border, otherwise it would be atleast vg/ex\nNo other cards with back issues to speak of\nSeveral cards would technically grade vg/ex I would think\n2 Horizontals\ntougher commons included in this lot\nBacks are all Piedmont (3) and Sweet Caporal (25)\n\n[IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/sc01980334-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/sc01981dcf.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\nLot 3 - F/G, with more being in the good range, includes two HOFers - $475 ($23 per common, $153 for HOFers)\n\nLajoie and Brown have pen writing on bottom borders\nParent and O'leary, pencil initials on back\nMcGann looksl ike faint pencil erased\nvery presentable group\n\n[IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/sc0197a984.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o138/trobba/sc0197d053.jpg[/IMG]",
