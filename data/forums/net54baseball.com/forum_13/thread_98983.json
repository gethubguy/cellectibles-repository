      "post_content": "Posted By: Dustan Hedlin\nHey guys, I am looking to sell or trade this Jake Pfeister T206, as I just purchased one in the same grade with a Sovereign back, and do not need 2 in my collection.  This has a clean Piedmont 350 back.  I will sell this for $47 Paypal or $45 check/MO, or trade for a similar grade T206.  I would prefer another Cubs card in trade, but can use anything that I do not have, which is a lot.  For reference, here are a few similar Cubs cards that I still need:\n\nHofman\nHoward\nKling\nKroh\nOverall hands at waist\nPfeister throwing\nReulbach glove\nSheckard no glove\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Dustanh1/T206/Pfeister.jpg[/IMG]",
