      "post_content": "Posted By: Mark T\nSent this to PSA raw. Before i sent it in the card was measured. From top to bottom measured huge (2.575) and Width measured just a tad under (1.990). Came back as &quot;Altered&quot;, i don't know what was altered since no explanation was given by PSA. Card is beautiful in every way, no creases, no wrinkles. Back is super clean with no tobacco stains. The embossed Gold is absolutely beautiful with no flaking anywhere. I put huge scans on post but if anyone needs them emailed i can do that. The back scan is hard to scan with PSA slab but i can take a camera pic if needed.\n\n \n\nAsking $179 delivered. By any payment you choose.SOLD\n\n\n\nvintagecards@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/t204stienfeldtfront.jpg[/IMG]?t=1231180315\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x198/SquareframeRamly/t204stienfeldtback.jpg[/IMG]?t=1231179742",
