The cards all measure correctly (not trimmed) and are free of paper loss on the back.\n  \nI'm looking to do simple, one-for-one trades for other T206 raw commons of comparable conditon, but will consider any T206 trade offers.  I can throw in cash if need be.  I prefer the on-field/action poses of major leaguers over the portraits of major leaguers, or any minor/southern leaguers.\n\nE-mail address is sschris@att.net.\n\nThanks. \n\nSteve\nChicago, IL\n\n[url]http://s546.photobucket.com/albums/hh412/willworkforT206[/url]/",
