      "post_content": "Posted By: Dan Koteles\nI wanted to wait until after CHristmas to post this sale, but I have to get some things in order because I will be traveling out of state to get my wife the best health care possible. We just recieved some news on a serious health issue. While I do have Blue Cross- I have to get my store bills ahead for a month and have money for some travel expenses. If we leave for awhile I will be taking my animals and renting elsewhere until I get some better health news. I appreciate any help.\n\n\nCObb T206 -1950.00-BVG 4.5.....this card should regrade anywhere a 5.5 and I will guarantee a 5 from the others. I paid 2100.00 because I like it so well. SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD\n\nT200 Detroit- 3500.00- This one I will miss . I think it is undergraded and should be a 7. You will not see another one like this . No marks of any kind , in fact the card looks brand new.\nPENDING SALE\n\n\nThis is a card for Detroit Joe -Jim.B- or Jeff Lichtman, the high grade guys ,I know there are a few others. PSA5....uh uh no way. I will guarantee a 6 or I will buy back within 60 days. THIS CAME FROM A RAW FIND OF THE ORIGINAL COLLECTOR !!!\n\nT205 Johnson - PSA4.....looks better then the 3 available on ebay at 999- 1250-1650.00.........925.00...SOLD SOLD. \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1230316442.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1230316504.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1230316547.JPG[/IMG] \n\n\nTHANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH !",

She went to Barnes Hospital in St. Loius for lung volume reduction surgery and did well enough that we are now back in Arizona.  We were originally looking at lung transplant before we went to Barnes as our insurance was no longer accepted at UCSD in San Diego.  The lord works in strange ways as we were originally told in San Diego that she needed a transplant.  After  LVRS at Barnes, she is oxygen free and no rejection drugs.  Keep your chin up and things will work out as it did for us.\n\nKmac",
