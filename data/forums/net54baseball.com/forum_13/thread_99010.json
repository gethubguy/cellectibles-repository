      "post_content": "Posted By: ChiSoxFan\nAfter reading Ted's post about 150 Series T206 cards and finding out that the Hindu (brown) back would be the hardest to find, I finally decided what player to try and get a &quot;master set&quot; of.\n\nI'm looking to any Frank Owen T206 (had to be a White Sox player). Here are the backs for this card:\n\nEl Principe De Gales\nHindu (Brown)\nOld Mill\nPiedmont - Series 150\nPiedmont - Series 350\nSovereign - Series 150\nSovereign - Series 350\nSweet Caporal - Series 150 - Factory 25\nSweet Caporal - Series 150 - Factory 30\nSweet Caporal - Series 150 - Factory 649 (Overprint)\nSweet Caporal - Series 350 - Factory 25\nSweet Caporal - Series 350 - Factory 30\n\nLooking for cards in Poor to Good condition. Prefer SGC graded, however I would also be interested in raw and PSA graded.\n\nPlease let me know what you have and how much, please include shipping charges in prices.\n\nThanks,\nChiSoxFan",
