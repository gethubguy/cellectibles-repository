      "post_content": "Posted By: steve yawitz\nI'm in one of my phases of hobby restlessness and feel like shaking things up a bit, so I'm thinking of parting with my T206 St. Louis collection, which includes the two rarities, a handful of rare backs and a couple of high-grade cards. Well, an 80 and 84 - of Hall of Famers, no less - which are nice grades here in Armpit Nation. \n\nAt this point, I'm just looking to trade for other stuff from the pre-WWII era, but if I'm able to work out a deal or two, I'd probably open the floodgates and start pricing the remaining cards. Anyway, if anybody's interested, I have a few T206 St. Louis folders on my site. The first two folders have close-cropped scans while the third one includes full-slab scans of my graded St. Louisans:\n\nCardinals - [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/yawiesbaseballcards/stlouiscardinals[/url]\n\nBrowns - [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/yawiesbaseballcards/stlouisbrowns[/url]\n\nGraded - [url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/yawiesbaseballcards/slabbedt206s[/url]\n\nThanks for looking,\nSteve\n\n \n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99[/url]",

I haven't really picked much up over the last few months and don't foresee that changing unless I'm willing to part with some cards. I'll probably end up keeping a few St. Louisans, but it's time to recycle the cardboard. \n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99[/url]",

I have, though, finally added prices to many of my graded cards. I have not yet added prices to the major rarities since I'm still talking trades with a few people but will hopefully make some decisions on their fate by the end of the weekend.\n\nThanks again,\nSteve\n\n[url]http://imageevent.com/yawie99/yawiesbaseballcards/slabbedt206s[/url]\n\nEdited to add: Noise-bringing offers would be entertained on the unpriced stuff. \n\nCash Rules Everything Around Me \nC.R.E.A.M.\nGet the money\nDolla dolla bill, y'all",
