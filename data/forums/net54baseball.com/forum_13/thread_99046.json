I've done hundreds of them, most recently this afternoon after the mailman delivered a 5.5 Topps 1952 Ivan DeLock and 2 different 1982 Topps blackless graded 8. Go slow, and be careful. I split 3 full edges before I open the slab like a book and remove the card.\n\nBest of luck,\nDoug",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Jeff Schwarz\nThis may not be acceptable or too dangerous for some but has been very effective for me.  I take a straight edge screw driver and place it in the middle on the bottom side between the two pieces of plastic.  Push a little and twist, move down 1/2 inch and repeat.  Then move from the middle to the other side every half inch.  All the while the case is cracking open.  You can then go slightly up each side, pull the plastic apart and presto!  Free at last, free at last!",

PSA holders take only one cut and fall in to two pieces easily. SGC usually takes two, so I cut between the tag and the card top, then along one of the edges as far away from the card as possible.",

      "post_content": "Posted By: jeff W.\nYou guys have some impressive ways to crack open a psa slab. All I do is take a butter knife, find the seam of the slab on the side, and twist the knife back and forth. The case cracks pretty easy which allows you to run the knife around the edges to crack the whole thing open. Works all the time.\n\nJeff",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Dan Collins\nI use a small flat head screwdriver and a little hammer. On the side of the PSA holder there are little notches that sometimes you can pop the seal without a hammer just by sliding the screwdriver in. When I use both the screwdriver and the hammer I put the card between my knees and then tap the screwdriver through the side of the holder just enough to start popping the seal all around it.\n\nI have probably popped over 100 cards out of holders and knock on wood have not damaged any yet. \n\nBy the way BVG graded cards are a big pain to get out!!\n\n\n\nDan Collins",

Pro holders are the toughest objects known to man kind. I once knew a man who cut a diamond with one!",

It's easy.   Takes guts to do it the first time, but after that, it's easy.  PSA slabs are easy.  BGS slabs are a pain in the butt and is the only time I've ever damaged one (1994 Arod SP).\n\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i26.tinypic.com/10fszfr.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i26.tinypic.com/11hxweh.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i26.tinypic.com/13yhvnk.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i32.tinypic.com/30af2iu.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/b54b3a.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/oteph2.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i28.tinypic.com/2dukprt.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i25.tinypic.com/2645qp2.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/ioorra.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i30.tinypic.com/2w6ucnm.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/idc9xh.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]",
