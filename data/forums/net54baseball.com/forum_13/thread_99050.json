Meehan\nI just retired my T3 Set (T3 Cash-Ryme #2 PSA All Time Registry):\n\n[url]http://www.psacard.com/SetRegistry/alltimeset.aspx?s=23238[/url] \n\nDecided to sell most of my commons individually - primarily PSA 5's, 6's and a couple of 7's (keeping the HOF'ers).  I would also consider trade for high end rarities in some cases. If you have any interest, please email me privately.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nDennis",
