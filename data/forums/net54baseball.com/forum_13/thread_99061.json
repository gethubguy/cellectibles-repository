HOFers, Chase, Merkle and Shag (my personal favorites) make up the group.  \nTake a look at the 20 card common lot, in lower grade, in REA last year that sold for $9900ish last spring for a price comparison.\n\nIf I have any takers, I want to start on the set, if not no worries, I will just build this lot as far as I can afford.\n\nThey are all yours for $17,500 Next Day, insured delivery.\n\nAmerican Beauty 350 with frame Roger Bresnahan (WB) SGC 50\n\nBroad Leaf 350 J.
