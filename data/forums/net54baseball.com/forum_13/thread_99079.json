      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Brailey\nBeautiful T206 Carolina Brights HOF'er.  SGC30 Good but looks much nicer.  \n\n\n\nFront: nicely centered, great color, very nice registry.\n\nBack: well centered and boldly printed Carolina Brights reverse.  \n\n\n\nReason for SGC dowgrade to 30 I believe is due to paper chip on right side border and small indentation on reverse near bottom border (both are not very obvious at first look).  Solid card.  Must be seen to be appreciated. \n\n\n\nSOLD. \n\n\n\nPlease contact Mike at mikebrailey@yahoo.com for scans. \n\n\n\nCheck, money order of paypal accepted. Please add 3% if paying by paypal.",
