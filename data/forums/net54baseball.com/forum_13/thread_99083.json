I would like to sell as a lot $250 takes it all.  That puts the 3 HOFers at $33.33 each and $15 each on the commons.  Paypal is prefered on this on, no fees.  I will take care of the insured delivery:\n\nGrades P-VG\nJoss Polar Bear\nBresnahan- P150\nJennings scrapbook residue on back- P150\nJones STL- P150\nMurphy thowing- P150\nNicholls Phi- P350\nBridwell NY- P150\nHerzog NY- P150\nLennox Brooklyn- SC350\nSchlei NY- SC150 OP\nMurphy Batting- P350\nLord BOS- P350\nKrause PHI- SC350\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232496242.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232496267.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232496304.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232496331.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232496350.JPG[/IMG] \n\nSorry one scan was to big to fit.
