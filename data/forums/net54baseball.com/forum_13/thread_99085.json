      "post_content": "Posted By: Tim Newcomb\nOffering for sale a very tough T207 Ragan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRagan is not quite in the group of scarcest T207s that go for four figures (Lowdermilk, W. Miller, I. Lewis, and Donlin) but he is in the next five or six-- quite tough.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition is a good-looking Fair with some creases and general wear but no major damage.    The Cycle back is quite clean and bright. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd be surprised if you found another Cycle Ragan at all, much less any cheaper, unless it was totally trashed.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking $375 all-inclusive.  Check or money order is preferred.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the new image posting works, but apparently you can access scans at this page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr\"][URL=\"https://www.net54baseball.com/mobiquo/<span class=\"]http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr[/URL]>/\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr/?action=view&current=t207ragancycle.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr/?action=view&current=t207raganb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for looking,\n\n\n\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/URL]",
