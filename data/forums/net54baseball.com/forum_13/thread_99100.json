      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Brailey\nFor sale is an SGC10 George McQuillan with bat with a rare Drum back.\n\nReason for low SGC10 grade is primarily due to one heavy horizontal crease.   Back presents very nicely but crease is evident on back and looks to break the paper on right side.  Front has good color, great centering and a couple small paper disturbances at chest and right shoulder but not very noticable.  Back is a bit off center but presents the entire purple Drum advertisement quite nicely.\n\nPrice $1,250 postage and insurance included.\n\nScans upon request.  Please contact me at mikebrailey@yahoo.com\n\nThanks,\n\nMike",
