      "post_content": "Posted By: Eric\nLooking for a T206 HOFer with a DRUM back.  Looking for a PSA 1.5 or 2, or an SGC 20-30.  Would also consider lower grades if they are presentable and there is no back damage.  Could possibly consider slightly higher grades too.\n\nWill trade the following two cards:\n\n1) T206 Rube Manning with UZIT back SGC 30\n\n2) T206 Jack Warhop with DRUM back SGC 20\n\nPlus I also have these cards still available to work out a deal:\n\n[url]http://s282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade[/url]/ \n\nAnd I also have an SGC 50 Shag Shaughnessy with an Old Mill back as additional trade bait if interested, and some cash.\n\nEDITED: Seems I have underestimated the toughness of this Combo.  So a few other cards I have available to offer in a possible trade are:\n\nT206 Demmitt (St. Louis varation) SGC A (beautiful card, just slightly trimmed at the top.  Nicest you will ever see)\n\nT206 O'Hara (St. Louis variation) SGC 20\n\nT214 Victory Tobacco Joe Kelly SGC 10 (1 of 1 with no others known).\n\n\nNote: the Shag, Demmitt, O'Hara, UZIT, DRUM, and Victory Tobacco are only available for this trade, and are not for sale.\n\n[IMG]http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k14/crazylocomerk2/1909-11T206ManningRube_PitchingUZIT.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k14/crazylocomerk2/1909-11T206WarhopJackDRUM.jpg[/IMG]",
