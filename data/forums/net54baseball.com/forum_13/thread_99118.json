Updated list below.\n\n\n\nI've split the remainder into categories, so check pre-1920 BST as well.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScans should be available through the link below.  I've been having a lot of problems figuring out the image-editing program that came with HP's Vista software, and haven't been able to crop them into individual images, so you'll see some collective scans there.  Hopefully they will give you enough info.  I can also send you scans by email on request.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmails take priority over posts.  First person to commit to buying has priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nChecks/money orders preferred to avoid paypals fees, but paypal is negotiable.\n\n\n\n\n\nS/H (first-class without insurance) included in these prices.   If you want insured shipping, please add a couple of bucks to the total.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT206 Guiheen (Difficult Southern Leaguer) G-VG+, with light horizontal creases  SOLD\n\n\n\nT222 Frank Chance PSA1 $150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[URL=\"http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr\"][url]http://s192.photobucket.com/albums/z9/apspr>/[/url][/URL]",
