I have a few bucks in my Paypal account and a couple things I could trade...Anyone interested in parting with some C46s?  I need McGinley of Toronto and every other non-Toronto card, so it's pretty wide open.\n\nGraded or non-graded, but probably just presentable vg-ex or so.\n\nEmail or post.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRichard.",
