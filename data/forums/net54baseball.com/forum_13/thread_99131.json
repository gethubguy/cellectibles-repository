      "post_content": "Posted By: Bobby I.\nI just received the grades for a nice group of T206's I had just sent to PSA for grading.   The results can be seen under the grading tab on PSA under submission number 4673433.    I am looking to sell them at the prices indicated below if anyone has interest, I realize these are slight premiums to PSA prices but if anyone is looking for them outside of an auction setting you are welcome to purchase them.  I only accept paypal and please add $2 per card for non insured shipping, I will insure them for an additional $3 per card if you would like insurance.   My email is kardboys@yahoo.com and first to indicate they would like them and make payment gets the card.   I am not interested in selling them for less than the price indicated.   Lastly I have not received the cards back from PSA yet however they indicated that they mailed them today so I don't expect to be able to ship them to you for at least a week.
