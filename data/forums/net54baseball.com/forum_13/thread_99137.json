Thanks to everybody on the board that I have traded with/purchased from over the past few years of collecting this set.  I'm looking for the following T206 cards:\n\n\n\nKeeler (with bat)\n\nKiernan\n\nPaige\n\n\nI prefer them in low condition...even beaters are fine for now.  Graded or raw.  I'm hoping to stay in the range of $100 or less for the Keeler and $50-$60 or so for the Kiernan and Paige.  If you are interested in trading, I also have over 100 mostly low grade T205's and T206's available including many HOF's and short prints.  Thanks for looking and please send any offers.  I will respond to all.",

Both are Old Mill I'd love to trade for any hall of famers or short prints. I'd prefer graded cards, SGC if yo have them. IF you send me a note at ddm4236@comcast.net I'll send you the scans I'm sure we can work it out.",
