These are from one of those licenced repro sets they made in a long box called &quot;the monster&quot; that I had as a kid before I could afford any of the originals.  I dont think this stack is complete but it has what looks to me to be about 475-500 cards.  I dont need them anymore and if anyone else wants to pay $15 to cover the shipping to mail them to you, you can have them to enjoy.  First e mail gets em.\n\nthemodo@hotmail.com\n\nRhys",
