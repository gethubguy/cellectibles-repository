      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\nThis month's list is a little more excessive than my normal sales lists.  I'm thinking about changing my focus a bit and getting back into set collecting so many of the really scarce type cards I've accumulated can be let go in the right deal.  I've included a small list of the cards I'm looking for in trade and have also included prices next to each card just in case people want to go the &quot;all-cash&quot; route.  \n\nA word of warning....many of the cards listed below represent personal favorites and cards that I spent a good deal of time trying to track down. In many cases, I had to pay an aggressive price to acquire the card.  So in turn, some of the prices below are on the aggressive side as I'm not exactly trying to push these cards out the door if you understand my meaning [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]  Scans are always available upon request.  \n\nThanks guys,\n\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n--------------------------\n\nWhat I'm looking for\n\nt207 Napoleon backs - need most\nt210 Orange Borders - need most\nw590 - Ruth, Spencer\n1911 Zeenuts - Bernard, Lindsay, Melchoir, Pfyl, Ryan SF \n1918 Zeenuts - any\n1919 Zeenuts - Lane (oak), Nourse (oak), Pinelli (sac), Prough (sac), Vance (sac), Spencer (saltlake), Seaton (SF), Smith (SF), Snell (SF), Eastley (SEA), Arbuckle (Vern), Check (Vern), Houck (Vern), Meusel (vern)\n\n----------------------------\n\nSALE/TRADE LIST\n\n\nc46 Complete Set of 90 -- $5200\nd311 group of 30 -- $6200\nt202 Bresnahan PSA 5 -- $160\nt204 Archer PSA 1 - faint wrinkling....tough common to find -- $250\nt209-2 B.E.
