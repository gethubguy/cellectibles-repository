      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian C.\nOffered is a great selection of some of the toughest HOF'ers from the 1911 T332 Helmar stamp set: Bresnahan (St. Louis), Evers (Chicago), Griffith (Washington), Jennings (Detroit), Tinker (Chicago), and Wallace (St. Louis). Their scarcity pales in comparison to their T206 counterparts. These six comprise about 25% of the HOF'ers in the T332 set. See the scans for condition. Note that the Tinker and the Wallace each have another (non-baseball) stamp affixed to the reverse, as is often seen with Helmars. The Jennings has staining. I will also include an off-condition Tinker (not pictured) for free. $360 shipped.\n\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/helmars-2.jpg[/IMG]",
