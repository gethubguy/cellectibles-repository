      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Navarro\nI picked up this T3 Ty Cobb back in mid October and planned to perhaps resurrect my Ty Cobb collection with it.   However, my passion truly is HOF signed rookies and as I continue to add more and more signed rookies, I need to dedicate my collecting passion and resources to that and not to a Ty Cobb collection.  I had this listed on a couple occasions on ebay and I turned down best offers of $475\n\nI paid $$650.00 plus shipping for this on October 12, 2008 for this from a fellow board member.   It's not often I admit it, but I made a bad buy and paid too much for it.   I'm willing to cut my losses and sell for $500.00 delivered in the Continental US if anyone wishes to add this beauty to their collection.   If I can't sell it for $500.00, I'll make a coaster out of it or something [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]  Lower offers will not be entertained.  I accept payments via paypal and cash in person in Waxahachie, TX. No discount for cash.\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i34.tinypic.com/2u77hgo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/2ii9wuo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n\nTake care,\n\nMike",
