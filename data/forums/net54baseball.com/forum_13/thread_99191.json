First to email me accepting these terms gets the card. \n\n\n\nbhodes@rcn.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW This variation is not easy to find.  The last one at available at auction in this (PSA) grade was 2+ years ago (and sold for more --> actually it was probably this card, I don't remember when I got this) . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the one listed on VCP (which I recommend) as having sold last is the more common Close Mouth var. (hence the lower price),  you can check the scan if you are are a subscriber. \n\n\n\nMile High more recently sold a &quot;4&quot; for over $450.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it matters the reason I am selling this to try to offset some of the cost for the PSA 6 I just bought.\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i229.photobucket.com/albums/ee53/TylersSister/Collins205a.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i229.photobucket.com/albums/ee53/TylersSister/Collins205b.jpg[/IMG]",
