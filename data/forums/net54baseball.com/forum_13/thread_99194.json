Would anybody be willing to trade one or two commons from the T206 series for more modern cards? I can e-mail a list of some of the stuff I have to whomever would be interested. Anybody's help would be greatly appreciated. I am just hoping to pick up a couple commons.\n\nEdited per requests to explain more\n\n\nCards are mostly 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  \n\nSome cards I have to trade:\n\n\n1961 Topps Carl Yastremski (G-VG) One Corner Crease\n1986 Topps Steve Young RC\n2000 Autographics Priest Holmes\n2000 Fleer Showcase Legacy Thomas Jones RC #d (2/20)",
