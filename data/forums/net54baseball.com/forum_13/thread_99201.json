Sold 1 item to a member before it hit the b/s/t and bought 1 item.\nPerfect e-bay, but mostly buying the last couple years. So, I'll start small and, with my collection, stay small.\n\n206's - SOLD\n\n213-1 - best offer within the next few days - can't find much current activity to even price it. Are they rare or nobody cares or collects?\n\nCash, check, m.o. Simple mail.\n\nThanks - Will\n\n[IMG]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww290/willstk_photos/t206front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww290/willstk_photos/t206back.jpg[/IMG]",
