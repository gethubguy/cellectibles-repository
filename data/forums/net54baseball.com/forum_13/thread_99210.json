Terrific looking pose, one of the more popular ones from the t210 sets as well.  Conditionwise, the card has some corner wear but no significant wear or other damage.  No wrinkling or creases exist anywhere on the card and the back is clean and damage free.  Asking $385...\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBrian\n\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232911228.JPG[/IMG]",
