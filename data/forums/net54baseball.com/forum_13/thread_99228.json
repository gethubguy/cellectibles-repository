      "post_content": "Posted By: Martin Neal\n\nHi guys and gals,\n\nI'm looking to sell my sgc graded T206 collection (Long Strange Trip). It would be nice to sell to an individual collector, but will sell indiviual cards if no offers have been accepted by tonight. If someone is interested in the entire lot, please call me at 434-825-6792. The set should have something for everyone, from lower graded cards which present nicely\nto mid to high grade hall of famers. Vintagecardprices.com will be used as a guide for individual cards. Insurance is optional below orders of $100.00 and required for orders above that total. if using Paypal, 3% of total will be added. Discounts are available for larger orders. For pricing, email me a list of the cards you want and I will respond quickly. I don't think I will be able to &quot;hold cards&quot; so the first to commit will get them. Please see link below for scans. Thanks and it's been fun.\n\nMartin\n\nlmneal4@aol.com\n\n\n\n[url]http://www.sgccardregistry.com/set.aspx?cat=1&set=239&userset=2121[/url]",
