Carleton Molesworth;\n5.  Charles Seitz;\n6.  Dolly Stark;\n7.  Juan Violat.\n\nPlease send scans and prices to aamoniz@yahoo.com if you have any of the above you'd like to sell!\n\nRegards,\nAdam\n\nEdited to add:  I would be more than willing to trade my lower grade examples of these cards and just add cash to make up the difference if anyone is looking to downgrade.  That being said, I am of course fine with doing just a straight cash purchase!",
