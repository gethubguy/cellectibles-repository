      "post_content": "Posted By: David M\nI have a raw Harry Howell T206 Portrait BROAD LEAF 350 back.  The card has a hairline wrinkle about 3/4&quot; long above his head and is altered with what appears to be white out at the top of the card to help cover up some chipping I guess.  The card is generally nice and may be fixed but I will not try it.  The back is rare and the printing is clean.  I will take offers on this to my email: three4moore@yahoo.com\n\nThanks....David\n\n[IMG]http://i714.photobucket.com/albums/ww141/theflyingm/HowellBL.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i714.photobucket.com/albums/ww141/theflyingm/BLback.jpg[/IMG]",
