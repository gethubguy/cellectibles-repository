      "post_content": "Posted By: Scott Levy\nLadies and Gents,\n\nI am breaking up our T206 graded set (#12 PSA) and looking to purchase a higher grade raw lot/lots of T206 cards.\n\nAll cards EXCEPT the Demmitt and Cobb Green are available.  Since I don't have the time or patience to individually price all cards, let's just say that if your offer is at or above the average recent sale price for the card in its grade I will very likely accept it.\n\nPlease respond via email to scottglevy@yahoo.com\n(I don't have scans of these cards but have been very diligent to pursue sharp and reasonably well centered cards -- if your card is a major star and a scan is requested I will do my best to get you one).\n\nNo discounts on single card purchases -- however, discounts on large lots (e.g. 20 or so cards will be considered and likely given).\n\nPlease see the link below for details -- thanks for looking!\n[url]http://www.psacard.com/SetRegistry/publishedset.aspx?s=2208[/url]\n\nRegards,\nScott",

I just posted a few cards on my PSA set registry under AKRON, I have another 160 or so raw t206s and want to trade to get the cobb.  I have also the Weimer ghost and a Kruger scrap card.\n\nany direction from you or help in aquiring the Cobb would be appreciated.\nthx,  dan",

I'm not the only expert on here -- so many of the people on Net54 are very knowledgeable.  \n\nThe direct answer to your question is that it depends heavily on what your goals are.  If you're looking to compete on the registry, you'd want a respectable graded example.  If you're looking to resell -- you have to be very concerned about the cost of the card and resale potential.  Of course there are many other possibilities as well.\n\nRegards,\nScott",
