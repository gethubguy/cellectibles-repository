      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Navarro\nI picked up this T3 Ty Cobb back in mid October and planned to perhaps resurrect my Ty Cobb collection with it.   However, my passion truly is HOF signed rookies and as I continue to add more and more signed rookies, I need to dedicate my collecting passion and resources to that and not to a Ty Cobb collection.   I'm going to try it one more time. I lowered the Buy it Now to $749.95 and with the current Microsoft Cashback offer of 30%, that would make your net cost $549.95.    So if you want it, go get it.\n\nHere's a link:\n\n[L=T3 Cobb PSA Auth on ebay][url]http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230311437666&ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:US:1123[/url][/L]\n\nObviously it has damage as you can see, trimming, trimming and more trimming, a hole, creasing etc.    \nMike\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i34.tinypic.com/2u77hgo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]\n[IMG][IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/2ii9wuo.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]",
