He had a stack of 4 that was the Cubs infield. Tinker, Evers, Chance and Steinfeldt. He said he would only sell as a group. I tried to talk him out of the Steinfeldt for an hour with no luck. I went home and grabed about 30 of my rarest 206s and went back and bought the card for 50 bucks after 10 minutes of talking and showing him my cards. \nI think he will be checking backs after we talked.",
