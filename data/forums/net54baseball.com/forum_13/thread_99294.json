      "post_content": "Posted By: Marc Del Percio\nHello. I have the following T205's, T206's, and T207's available for sale or trade. I am epecially looking for low grade T207's and/or E90-1's in trade but will consider trades for any pre-war cards I need. \n\n\n\nAs you can see by the scans below, many of the raw cards are in VERY poor condition and may have significant paper loss or major damage such as missing corners or edges, holes, tears, etc. These are priced accordingly. \n\n\n\nI have added a few cards to the list that do not appear in the scans. I'd be glad to e-mail scans of any of those if requested. Also, there are multiple copies of a few of the cards. Please be sure to specify which one you are interested in if making a purchase or trade offer on any of these. \n\n\n\nFor purchases under $25, please add $3.00 for shipping. Any purchase of $25+ includes free shipping. I accept payment via cash, check, money order or Paypal. Thanks for looking and please e-mail with any questions or offers. \n\n\n\n\n\nGRADED T206: \n\n\n\nLake (no ball in hand) - PSA 1(MK) pencil mark on front $18 \n\nMARQUARD HOF (portrait) - SGC 10 $35 \n\nOakes - SGC 10 $20 \n\nO'Leary (hands on knees) - SGC 10 $22 \n\nFrank Smith (F.
