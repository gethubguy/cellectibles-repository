I would love to acquire one with a Hindu back.\n\nI'm looking for lower grade examples (PSA 1-4, SGC 10-50) with good eye appeal.  Email me at: crazylocomerk@yahoo.com, with what you have (scans and your asking price).  I will respond in a timely manner.\n\nThank you in advance.",

SGC would knock that down to a 20 or 30.  If I'm going to pay that much for a Shag, it's gotta be flawless for the grade, and that one just isn't.",
