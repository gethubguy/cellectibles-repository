The front surface is really nice, but there is a small scuff near the right edge of the stats section on the reverse. $200 includes shipping and insurance.\n\n[URL=\"http://photos.imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/gradedbaseball/large/T201-Johnson-Street-SGC40.jpg\"][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/gradedbaseball/icons/T201-Johnson-Street-SGC40.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nA larger scan - and the remnants of my St. Louis T206 collection - can be found here: http://imageevent.com/yawie99/forsalefortrade/gradedbaseball.\n\n\nThanks,\nSteve",
