      "post_content": "Posted By: Jon Canfield\nThis &quot;small version&quot; Helmar clam shell cigarette box is the type that contained the T332 Helmar baseball stamps.  This box has the correct factor/district code (Factory 7, 3rd NY) and a complete 1910 series tax stamp making the liklihood that this exact box contained a T332 very high.  Perfect for those stamps only a few posts below!\n\nThe box is in very good overall condition.  The front, back and insides are perfect and display very very well.  The spine side is split as can be seen in the last photo below.  There are no tears on the box at all.  $45.00 shipped.\n\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=IMG_0691.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_0691.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=IMG_0692.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_0692.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=IMG_0693.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_0693.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=IMG_0696.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_0696.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n======================================\nFor the premier online souce of information on baseball-related cigarette packs, visit [url]http://www.baseballandtobacco.com[/url]",
