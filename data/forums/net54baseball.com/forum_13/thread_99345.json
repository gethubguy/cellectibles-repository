      "post_content": "Posted By: Dave H\nCurrently, I am building a T206 Frank Chance, Yellow Portrait, back variation set.  As has been discussed many times on this forum, this is one of the super prints from the T206 set.  I currently have 6 back variations and am looking to purchase others.  I am hoping that the forum community can help me out.\nAt present, I have\n   1. T206 Chance, Yellow Piedmont 350, Fact 25PSA 2.5\n   2. T206 Chance, Yellow Sweet Caporal 350, Fact 30        PSA 2.5\n   3. T206 Chance, Yellow Piedmont 350-460, Fact 25PSA  1\n   4. T206 Chance, Yellow Sweet Caporal 350-460, Fact 42 OPPSA 2.5\n   5. T206 Chance, Yellow Old Mill, Fact 25PSA  4\n   6. T206 Chance, Yellow Polar Bear, Fact 6        PSA  1\nI am looking for others, including rare backs (to include different Factories) to complete my set.  I prefer graded cards (PSA, SGC) in lower grades (PSA 1-4), and cards need to be complete, with little to no paper loss.  Ungraded cards also considered in low-mid condition.  For those super rare backs, condition is less of a concern.  Just a note, as many here, I am on a budget, so I may be interested in your rare back, but need a few weeks to collect the total.  Sorry, not much to trade, so mainly buying.\n\nSend Offers or scans to DHarford@satx.rr.com\nThanks\nDave\n\nAlso, will plan on bumping this every so often as my budget allows",
