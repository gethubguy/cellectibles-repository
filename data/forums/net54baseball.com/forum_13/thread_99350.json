This is going to be a very slow process, but I'd like to pick up a few every month, starting with this month.\n\nI'm looking for SGC graded cards and preferably SGC 40's where possible, but I will also consider PSA graded cards, and lower grades are fine on the tougher backs.\n\nI have the following cards available for trade:\n\n[url]http://s282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/[/url]\n\nIf you have something to offer please email me at: crazylocomerk@yahoo.com, with scans, and let me know which card/cards you are interested in.\n\nBelow are the backs I need. For obvious reasons I've skipped some from the top of the back scarcity list (1-6).  I currently have 20 Backs all designated with &quot;*****OWN*****&quot; and the player next to them.  I don't mind doubling up on HOFers either.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n7. Drum - Series 350- Factory 25 - District 2 - State VA *****OWN***** Warhop (not HOFer but it will do)\n8.
