I have another Bresnahan (batting) with a different back so this one has to go.\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/T206%20Back%20Set/1909-11T-206BresnahanRogerwithbatPO.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSecond, I'm looking for any of these three HOFers in one of the backs listed below (the list below contains the backs I need for my back set.
