      "post_content": "Posted By: Joann\nFor sale two T3's. \n\nMullin is in decent shape with creases/dents and has the tougher no-ad back.  Back is clean with essentially same creases as front.  SGC would probably give it a 20 and PSA might sneak it into a 2.  $175.\n\nMcIntyre is banged up on the borders, but the image is still fairly sharp.  Back is similar to front with same creases and pinholes.  $105.\n\nBack scans available on request.  For some reason the back scans are larger files than the front scans (?) and too large to post here.\n\nBoth prices are shipped.   Email jmkline@juno.com.  Priority to emails over posts.  A committment to purchase gets the card over requests for info, scans, etc.\n\nThanks.  \n\nJoann\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1237692562.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1237692631.JPG[/IMG]",
