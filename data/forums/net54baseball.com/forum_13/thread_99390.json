Got an M101-5 Mitchell\n\nI've got 1 card left I need to complete my wall display of the Addie Joss game (I've landed 37 of 38).  If you have or know the whereabouts of this card that might be available, I am paying/trading very strongly for it.  Condition does not matter, other then if the card is too nice, I may have to pass. \n\nM116 Falkenberg\n\nthanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n[URL=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/mwieder\"]My Trade/Sale Page[/URL]",
