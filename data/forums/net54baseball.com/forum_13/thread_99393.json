Great card nice color and clean back. Big scan below...\n\nI'll review any offers and let you guys know, like to sell here vs. eBay. Paypal taken just add a 2%.\n\nThanks, \n\nJohn\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/piojohn3/ebay/large/matty%20pied_1.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/piojohn3/ebay/large/matty%20back.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAdded Image of back",
