      "post_content": "Posted By: Dan Koteles\nlet me mention that my scanner doesnt do any justice to the colors. I have 3 really nice Tinkers and this one sickens the other 3 in color .It looks and is the most wicked Red card I have ever owned. I can easily promise satisfaction of the card and dont want to sell it, but the things coming up dictates otherwise.This is and looks 2-3 times better then the scan. \n\nI can do a credit card at my business if still interested. 810 715 0024....call me anyway at this number after 11:15 today est.\n\nThanks again\nDan",
