Don't get me wrong, I do own many T205 graded cards but my set is ungraded and this was bothering me last night. No, mine is not for trade either as it is a rather high grade T205. So, anybody have a low grade Hoffman in f-g condition they want to part with for relatively cheap?\n\nJoshua\n\nPS Still looking for a T205 Carrigan Polar Bear back as well.",
