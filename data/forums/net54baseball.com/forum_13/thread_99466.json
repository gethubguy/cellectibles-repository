      "post_content": "Posted By: E. Angyal\nThought I'd offer this group of tougher T-206s to the Net54 board first.  If there isn't enough interest in them at this time (they are currently ungraded), I will submit them to SGC at the Strongsville show in mid April.  All cards are very clean with nice color and no creases or wrinkles.  Some are vg/ex (Elberfeld, Lundgren), some are ex or ex+ (Dahlen, Browne, Kleinow). If you want, we can also work out a deal where the sales are contingent upon them coming back from SGC with a minimum grade that we mutually agree upon.  \n\nThe Lundgren (Chicago) card is one of the 5 cards reported in Ted Z's population report of Lungrens with a Piedmont 350 back (I purchased it from Charles Conlon about 6 years ago) - its pretty rare with this back.\n\nHigher resolution (400 dpi) scans are available upon request.  \n\nPlease email me at EANGYAL@roadrunner.com if you have any questions.  \n\nI will respond to emails in the order that they are recieved.  First one to email me with &quot;I'll take such and such&quot; gets the card(s).  All prices already include insured shipping.  If you buy multiple cards, I will give you a break on the shipping costs and reduce the total slightly.  Asking prices are shown on the scans.  I'd also consider trading these for Old Judges that I want.  Thanks for looking, \n\nEric \n[IMG]http://i660.photobucket.com/albums/uu328/EricAngyal01/T206-Vertical5-40.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i660.photobucket.com/albums/uu328/EricAngyal01/T206-Horizontal5-40.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAlso see my other items for sale on BST.",
