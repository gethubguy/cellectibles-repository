Just curious.\n\nWhen you have the top 6 posts, you knock everyone else down the list and don't give them a fair shot at selling, trading, etc.  It's not proper B/S/T etiquette.",

I think if you want to approach etiquette, you could have personally emailed me instead of posterizing your feelings. \n\nI can see it your way, but I can also see it my way, as I was sitting here on a Sunday afternoon scanning in lots, and selling them accordingly. \n\nIf you are that torn up about it, just bump your lot your selling to the top.\n\nReally, not a big deal either way... Best to you -",
