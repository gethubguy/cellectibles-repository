Graded, ungraded, I don't care (as long as the ungraded card will grade numerically).  \n\nLooking for decent eye appeal, and no paper loss on the back is a must.  Something in the 10-40 grade range.\n\nWould prefer a HOFer to help with my set (T206 back variation set w/HOFer front).  Not particular with the HOFer (I'll take what I can get).\n\nIf you have something for trade, email me at: crazylocomerk@yahoo.com\n\nHere are my 3 cards available for trade:\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/1909-11T206DemmittRayStLouisVariati.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/1909-11T206ManningRube_PitchingUZIT.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/For%20Sale%20or%20Trade/1915T214VictoryTobaccoKellyJoe.jpg[/IMG]",

I'm still scrolling page by page through the auction online).\n\nGood luck with your quest,\nAdam",

I appreciate the compliments.\n\nAnd I wish you guys had one too [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]\n\nAdam, I did see those in REA.  They are absolutely beautiful cards, but a little too high grade for my collection (and not by choice).",
