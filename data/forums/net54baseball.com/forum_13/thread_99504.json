The original seller stated the card might be trimmed, but guaranteed it's authenticity.\nIt's a sweet looking card, unfortunately it's a wee bit short width wise.\nMy ebay id is: neenish (have a perfect 100% rating with over 890+ positive feedbacks).\n$250.00 OBO shipped to the US via USPS Priority mail w/insurance and delivery confirmation. (The scanner is dirty)\nAm I asking too much for this card?\nThe mark on the front is a scratch on the slab, no creases are on the card.\nQuestions: bghkoyama at yahoo dot com\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v223/bghkoyama/ChristyMathewsonT206Front.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v223/bghkoyama/MattyBack.jpg[/IMG]",
