      "post_content": "Posted By: Bob Bannon\nHi,\n\nThis past year my sister and I embarked on a project to rebuild a collection of the monster that had been stolen from our Dad years ago. All but 13 of his T206's that he began collecting some 50 years ago were taken. In less than 2 years we were able to assemble all but 59 cards and present it to him this past Christmas. It was a very tearful event.\n\nI want to thank again the very many who helped us. Especially Chuck Paris who pushed us at the end and really made it feel robust. I will be in Chuck's debt for a very long time, literally and figuratively.\n\nI think we have added time to our Dad's life through this. He has gone to a show and even went ON LINE! That is huge for him.\n\nSo I have grabbed back the album and we want to try and make a run at the 40 or so that are left that we might actually be able to find. This collection averages G. There are many Authentic cards and honestly anything identifiable works for us. Most are HOFers and SLers. Please let us know if you have any from this list to sell or trade.\n\nHere is a list of those remaining that we need:\n\n71 Carey,\n98 Coles, \n99 Collins, Eddie Philadelphia\n115a Dahlen Boston,\n122b Demmit-St Louis,                           Yikes!!!!!\n131 Donovan-portrait, \n143b J. Doyle NY hands above head, \n155b Elbefeld-Washington portrait, \n157 Ellam,\n172 Foster, \n175 Fritz,\n193 Guiheen,\n202 Helm, \n206 Hickman,\n213 Hooker, \n229 Johnson-hands at chest, \n244 Kiernan,\n264 Lajoie-w/bat, \n287a Magie,                         Yikes!!!!!\n291 Manion, \n300 Mathewson-white cap,\n355b O'Hara-St Louis                Yikes!!!!!\n362 Otey, \n367 Paige,\n375 Perdue,\n377 Persons,\n395 Reagan, \n398 Revelle,\n409 Ryan,\n423 Seitz, \n429 Shaughnessy,\n441 Smith-Atlanta, \n450 Stark,\n470 Thebo,\n473 Thornton,\n484 Wagner-bat on left shoulder,\n\n\n\nPlease let us know if you have any from this list to sell or trade.\n\nThanks very much,  Bob Bannon      www.biggcards.com\n\nbiggies@aol.com \n\n&quot;The best thing I ever saw never really happened at all.&quot;\n- Guy in line at a Portalet outside Superbowl in San Diego",

I am in the process of a trade for Kiernan and Revelle. I was looking forward to putting together the Southern League set when I saw your post.
