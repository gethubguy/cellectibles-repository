I know for me it was one of the last few pins to find when I completed my P2 set.\n\nIt is in beautiful shape free of foxing,rust,spots,tears,etc,etc,etc.\n\nAsking $99 shipped. Paypal or MO is fine.\n\nThanks\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1239985961.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1239985980.JPG[/IMG]",
