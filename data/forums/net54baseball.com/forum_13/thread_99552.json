What's important is that the player is either a HOF member or notable for some other reason.  I am searching for 2 cards - one pre-war and one from early topps/bowman sets.\n\nIn a perfect world - a T206 or a '33 Goudey would be great; however, I'm open to suggestions.  Looking to spend somewhere in the $50-$60 range per card.  Graded would be preferred.\n\nThanks!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n[URL=\"http://www.blacksoxfan.com\"][IMG]http://www.blacksoxfan.com/images/art/sig.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"shoelessjoe@blacksoxfan.com?subject=Net54\"]email me[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://blog.blacksoxfan.com/\"]The Black Sox Blog[/URL]",
