      "post_content": "Posted By: Jim\nStarted the set last fall - mostly nicer raw cards and some graded 4's and 5's.  I thought it might be nice to include one NM card as a sort of reference point.  Everyone seems to try to get one of each back - I might try for one of each grade instead.\n\nLooking for a common PSA 7 or SGC 84 that someone might be interested in selling at a reasonable price. Only interested in one that is representative of the grade and not a misgrade.  A portrait would also be better than some of the more cartoonish poses (Spike, Kisinger, etc.) - one where the registration and color really show well.\n\nAs a benchmark, there are currently two commons available BIN in the $550 range. \n\nemail is jlynch@capspart.com\n\nIf not, thanks for looking.",
