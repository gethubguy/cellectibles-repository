      "post_content": "Posted By: Mike Brailey\nT206 McQuillan with rare DRUM back.  Back presents nicely, centered a bit to the right but entire design well within borders.  Relatively heavy horizontal crease that has broken the paper a bit on the back is primary reason for grade.  Still presents well if you're looking for a DRUM back.  A couple minor flakes of paper loss on front chest.  $1,100 or best offer.\n\nPlease contact me for scans at mikebrailey@yahoo.com\n\nThanks,\nMike",
