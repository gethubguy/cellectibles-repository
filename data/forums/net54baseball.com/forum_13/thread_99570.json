      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nI have a pretty neat piece hat would go well with ones T206 collection. The front features the same design found on packages of Polar Bear tobacco while the back features a song (or poem?) -- pretty risque wording whatever it is.\n\nAnyways, the piece is in overall pretty nice shape as can be seenin the scan. I can't be 100% certain as to the date of the item, but it definitely has ties to the T206 era.\n\nPrice is  $75 shipped . Paypal or check/mo are fine. email to rhettyeakley@netzero.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1240214482.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1240214506.JPG[/IMG]",
