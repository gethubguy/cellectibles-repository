      "post_content": "Absolutely incredible card, razor sharp corners.  I prefer PSA graded cards, but this one is amazing, snow white borders and simply amazing! Deep, deep Color like I have never seen on a Lumley. Super clean SCap 150 back caps it off. There are only 4 PSA 7's and 4 PSA 8's of all backs, so this is extremely tough to find in high grade. $975, scans below...thanks, price reduced to $875 delivered.**SOLD**",
