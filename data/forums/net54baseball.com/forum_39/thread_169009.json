      "post_content": "Back in October, 2012,  I offered this card in trade for some vintage football cards without pricing it.  When I didn't receive any offers, I put a price on the card and even marked it down once without any takers. \n\nThe transfer on the Chappelle is John Ganzel, who appears in reverse,  ghostlike and featureless, surrounded by the red background of his card.  The card is in an SGC30 holder. \n\nI'm asking $45, but will listen to reasonable offers.  If you're interested, email me at [url]rgncubs@att.net[/url].  I'll pick up P&H and take paypal gift as as payment.\n\nI've also bumped up a nice M101-5 Art Wilson blank back as well.",

      "post_content": "I was just reading the posts from Blitzu regarding asking for offers on items.  I really don't know what this is worth, and I initially wanted to take offers for it on another post some time ago.  I got none, so I put a price on it.  When I read the posts for other items like it, it doesn't seem out of line, but no one seemed interested.  So... make me a legitimate offer and we can work it out.",
