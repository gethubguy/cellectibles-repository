      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\n\nLooking to trade this card. Most of my cards are poor to good, so this one sticks out like a sore thumb. :p\n\nFWIW, it's  the highest graded by SGC, and the only one graded higher is a PSA 6. \n\nIn return I'd be looking for a NY Amreican player in poor to vg condition with Cycle 460, AB460, Carolina Brights,  Piedy 42, or BL350 reverse.\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to cash going one way or the other to get a deal done, but I'm not looking to sell it outright at this time.\n\nThanks!\n\n[IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/IMG_0001_NEW_zps08bf7077.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s386/TheBabe1918/IMG_0004_NEW_zps9a019380.jpg[/IMG]",
