      "post_content": "Looking to buy any and every T206 Cub in every back except for the insane ones (Brown Lenox, BL460, Red Hindu, Uzit, Drum), though I'm sure I'll probably cave for at least one example of each at the end of the project. \r\n\r\nSince I'll be buying roughly 400+ cards (if I succeed), I'm looking for cards in the Poor/Auth-VG++ range. I don't care if they're trimmed, and all I prefer is that the fronts are presentable. I don't mind marks, miscuts, or small amounts of paper loss on the back. I would prefer them raw, as I'll be cracking them out anyways.\r\n\r\nE-mail is best:\r\n\r\n[url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nProgress thus far:\r\n\r\n155/400\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.",
