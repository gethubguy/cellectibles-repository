Which seems kinda silly technically. \r\n\r\nB) The plate was made wrong, with the upper section way out of place. That makes more sense, and could have happened if he transfer used to layout the plate had a fold that went unnoticed by the person doing the layout. (Def. a 4:50 friday or just back from a liquid lunch sort of thing)\r\n\r\nIf the plate is bad, it's possible the writing is a notation about the problem. \r\nThat would technically make the card a very late stage proof, or very early production with a then rejected plate. \r\n\r\nI really wish I had enough for this one. It's probably unique or nearly unique. \r\n\r\nI only know of two other cards I'd put in the same category, both 150 series.\r\nOne is the tinker with \"chicago\" under the \"cubs\" on the jersey, With two found so far. The other I'm keeping quiet about till I can find a nicer one that I can be completely sure of. \r\n\r\nSteve B",
