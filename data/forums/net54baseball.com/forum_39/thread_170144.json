I wont say its undergraded, but it really is, SOLD\r\n3.  Roger Bresnahan - formerly attracted someone's attention, this HOFer is well loved with character in every crease.  It only looks 200 years old SOLD\r\n4.  Chief Bender (after the fire) No Trees - should attract HOF collectors SOLD\r\n5.  \"Happy Jack\" Chesbro - the final attraction is a nice looking card that measures a tad short, but this HOFer was only 5'9\" for $48 shipped\r\n\r\nTwist my arm and take LaPorte & Chesbro for $75 shipped",
