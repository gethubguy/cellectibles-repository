      "post_content": "I am considering selling this T206 Sweeney. The card has a nice miscut on the back, and also has an ink shift on the front, and a wetsheet piedmont transfer front. \r\n\r\nBecause of the ink shift... part of another cards green ink is shown on the left front of the card.\r\n\r\nBefore I consign to an auction house I thought I would post on the BST. Please email me your offer if you are interested.\r\n\r\n[url]Blunder19@aol.com[/url] \r\n\r\n[URL=http://s251.photobucket.com/user/blunder19/media/Sweeney_zps1b3e8215.jpg.html][IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/Sweeney_zps1b3e8215.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s251.photobucket.com/user/blunder19/media/sweeneyback_zps5a001648.jpg.html][IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/sweeneyback_zps5a001648.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
