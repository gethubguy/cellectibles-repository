      "post_content": "Got the ones I was after, now the rest are up for grabs.  All cards have polar bear backs and grade authentic having been removed from a scrapbook.  I think some may have been altered, but I can't really tell which ones.  Overall though the cards retain great eye-appeal and awesome coloring.  Always willing to consider offers, especially on multiple purchases.  Will also consider trades for other cards with high eye appeal and low technical grades (trimmed, back damage, writing, etc.).   \n\nShipping is included in the price.  Paypal gift is preferred, but other methods are fine too.  Please PM or email me at [url]poorlydrawncat@gmail.com[/url] with offers or questions.\n\nT205s\n\nJohn McGraw - SOLD\nMordecai Brown - SOLD\nKid Elberfeld - SOLD\nRebel Oakes - SOLD\nRichard Hoblitzell - $20\nRussel Blackburne - SOLD\nJames Delehanty - $18\nGermany Schaefer - $18\nGeorge Stone - $25\nWilliam Foxen - $15\nHugh Jennings - $45\nRoger Bresnahan - $65\nChief Bender - $75\n\nT206s\n\nTy Cobb - $545\nTris Speaker - SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/YuHPD97.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/j7o0fvK.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/muTa2Hq.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Vr8Q4Yy.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PJAkvUo.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Cyc0qXU.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mVwESoR.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mSRYjIQ.png[/IMG]",
