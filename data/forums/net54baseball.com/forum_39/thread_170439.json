      "post_content": "Up for sale is this really unique trademark registration for Sweet Caporal cigarettes.  The registration was for the use of the trademark abroad (specifically, Portugal - with a note that distribution was extended to Macao).  The registration was first made in 1908, and then renewed in 10 year intervals up to 1958.  The top portion features an original Factory 42, North Carolina SC box.  I want to stress this is not a foreign pack - this is a flattened, original domestic outer shell from factory 42 which displays the trademark for registration purposes.\n\nOverall condition is perfect, with no flaws to speak of.  Really a unique piece.  SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/SCDistribution_zps805537e4.jpg[/IMG]",
