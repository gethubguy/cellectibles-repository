      "post_content": "This an absolutely beautiful card. You will not find many with better color than this one. I originally bought it years ago in a PSA 5 holder. I crossed it over to a GAI 5 ughh, and then SGC crossed it to a 50 because of a couple of extremely light surface wrinkles that you need magnification to see. The corners are definitely 5 quality and the color and focus are hard to beat. The borders are bright white. Please let me know of you have any questions or concerns. SOLD. Thanks for your consideration.\n\n[url]dean.hackett@surewest.net[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m52/DHack3/BB%20Cards/img141_zps9450bcba.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m52/DHack3/BB%20Cards/Card%20Backs/img142_zps7e930cbd.jpg[/IMG]",
