      "post_content": "Hello I have a PSA 1 MK Broadleaf of Arellanes that I would like to trade. The front has issues but the back is very presentable. In trade I would be looking for scarcer backed T206s or E94s. I will consider offers but would like to try and trade it first.\r\n                                        Thanks,\r\n                                         Steve",
