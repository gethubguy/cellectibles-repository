I would be interested in all poses except the bat on shoulder.\n\nIn regards to condition, I am simply looking for a decent eye appeal no matter the grade. \nvery highly graded pieces will likely not be in my budget for this particular one.\n\nIf you have one you are interested in moving, please feel free to PM me.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDerek",
