      "post_content": "Hi :)\r\n\r\nI am looking to add a few T206 to my collection:\r\n\r\nFred Clark (bat) ......  Sovereign 150\r\n\r\nHughie Jennings (two hands/ dancing) ..... American Beauty 460 .... OR A DRUM!!!:D\r\n\r\nOrval Overall (portrait) .... El Principe De Gales\r\n\r\nI do not care about the technical grade of the cards, only a respectable eye appeal. Basically, no beaters, but all other examples are just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you have any that you are willing to part with, please feel free to send me a PM and I would love to discuss a potential deal. Cash, Trade .... whatever.\r\n\r\nThank You Very Much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
