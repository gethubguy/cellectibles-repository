      "post_content": "I have this very nice looking McGraw portrait with a clean crisp sweet caporal back. It measures correctly 1 7/16 x 2 5/8 inches. I won this item on ebay with about 5 or 6 commons and a Waddell months ago. They were all listed under tobacco cards. I sent them to psa and they all got either 4's or 4.5's . The McGraw came back ungraded - trimmed. I do not see the trim myself. I don't know what it is worth so I am asking for offers. I am going to put it on ebay Tuesday if I don't sell it here. And although it measures I did come back trimmed from psa . I am selling this ungraded and because psa sent it back trimmed I don't want anyone to buy this hoping it will get graded elsewhere and be disappointed or want to return it if another grading company also deems it a trimmed card. If you don't care what psa thinks this is a super nice looking t206 McGraw. Thanks",
