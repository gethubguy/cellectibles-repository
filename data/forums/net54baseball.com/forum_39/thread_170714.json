I've picked up a few Cleveland T206's where I could for my team set collection but I think I need to sell them now to help fund some other projects.  No super rare backs, but still some nice cards.

I'm working on pricing/scans (should have been smart and done it before starting the thread)  Anyway, once prices are posted it will be first come, first serve.  If there would happen to be a particular card that you really need, shoot me an offer.  Prices posted will be check/cash/money order/paypal personal.  I'm more than happy to accept regular paypal, but it will be a tick more.  For simplicity, prices include shipping.  Just as a side note, I would also trade for high end graded Indians/Browns that I need for my sets (50's thru 80's)\n\nthanks for the interest!\n\n**EDIT**\nprices/pics added to all.  If you have things to trade that I might like let me know!",
