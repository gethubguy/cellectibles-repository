I ended up getting another recently, so this one is available.  I'd prefer to trade it for another EPDG HOF, or a couple of commons.  Would consider selling as well.\r\n\r\n(images from Sterling)\r\n[IMG]http://www.sterlingsportsauctions.com/ItemImages/000017/17148a_lg.jpeg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.sterlingsportsauctions.com/ItemImages/000017/17148b_lg.jpeg[/IMG]",
