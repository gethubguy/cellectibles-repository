      "post_content": "Am looking for a kindly T206 collector who will take in this maltreated card.   And send a few bucks my way at the same time.   Now this card sure isn't a 10.  Rounded corners, a small crease in the upper left corner, and a little scuffing and staining on the reverse might make it a 2, maybe a 3.  And the pencil marks in the area of the crease are responsible for the (MK) qualifier.   But a PSA1 .. that means it's Poor, and it sure isn't that.  \r\n\r\nThis card needs a good home.  Monte Cross played all or part of fifteen years in the majors, but he can't get any love from Newport Beach, CA.    BTW, check out the picture in Baseball Reference -- a mustache every bit as good as John Titus'.\r\n\r\nSo here' the deal.   The highest bidder before 6:00 PM EDT on Saturday June 22 wins the card.   \r\n\r\nI thank you, and I know that, somewhere out in the corn, Monte thanks you too.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=103765&d=1371765876[/IMG]",
