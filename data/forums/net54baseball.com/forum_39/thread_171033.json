      "post_content": "I'm toying with the idea of putting together a subset of Piedmont southern leaguers and would like to start by buying one or more groups of five or more different players.\r\n\r\nI'm open on grades, and it doesn't matter whether they're graded. Not interested in any beaters,  trimmed or heavily creased 1's or 2's. As long as the cards are presentable.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of what I'm thinking on price, the neighborhood of $65-$85 a card for nice 2's, depending on the player and how nice the card is. Obviously, higher graded cards, higher prices. Probably not interested in anything higher than a 4.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to get these on the cheap, but I'm also not looking to pay eBay BIN prices. If you're fair with me, I think you'll find I'm more than fair with you.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'd prefer to buy at least five different at a time, and I'd like to see scans.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]",
