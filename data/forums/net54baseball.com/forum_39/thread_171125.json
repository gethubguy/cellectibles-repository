I have a Vic Willis bat with an AB no frame I'm willing to sell/trade and I'm also looking to buy (or use the Willis as a partial trade for) a Bridwell w/cap, lower grade fine, higher grade too if it's part of the trade. Front just has to be presentable, graded or ungraded. Let me know what you got!",
