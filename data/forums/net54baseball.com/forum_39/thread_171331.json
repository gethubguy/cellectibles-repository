Looks like the brown/black in the face was printed twice or missed, you can see the double eyes, eyebrows are bigger and hair is up a little too. \n\n  Also this card has a nice stray red printing line on the right side, plus the red has a slight color shift up on the card\n\n  Clean SC 350/30 back. Asking $100 dlvd paypal...LOWERED! (all caps for emphasis)",
