He didn't flip them card for card from front to back, so it is Flanagan I'm interested in. Contacted him, as he had no bidders, but said he was interested only in selling as a lot. I'd be in for $45 for the one card, let me know if you're interested in going for the rest. \r\n\r\nThanks. This would be #234 if I can get it.",
