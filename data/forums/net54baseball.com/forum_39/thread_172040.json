      "post_content": "Faced with the reality that: 1) I need some cash; 2) I will never get the Uzit back, and; 3) I'd rather focus my time/money on my HOF RC Collection, I'm unloading my ENTIRE T206 McGraw Portrait w/ Cap back run.\r\n\r\nHere's the breakdown of available cards with prices that include shipping/insurance:\r\n\r\n1t206 Black Lenox (only 4 PSA, 2nd highest) PSA 1.5 = $SOLD!\r\n2T215 Red Cross (only 1 higher) SGC 40 = $SOLD!\r\n3t206 Polar Bear (highest graded) PSA 5 = $SOLD!\r\n4t206 Cycle 460 (only 4 graded) SGC 20 = $475\r\n5t206 Tolstoi (only 8 PSA, 3 higher) PSA 3.5 = $450\r\n6t213-2 Coupon Cigarettes (only 2 higher)SGC 50 = $250\r\n7t206 Old Mill (highest graded) SGC 40 = $275\r\n8t206 Sweet Caporal 42 Overprint PSA 3 = $190\r\n9t206 P350-460 No.25 SGC 35 = $110\r\n10t206 Sweet Caporal 25 PSA 2 = $SOLD!\r\n11t206 Sweet Caporal 30SGC 10 = $SOLD!\r\n\r\nI can certainly cut a deal of some sort if you buy them all.  Some of these bad boys are either the highest graded example, or just rare back/front combos.  LMK!\r\n\r\nJimi",
