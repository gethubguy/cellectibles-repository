      "post_content": "It's been a fun ride, but I've decided to part with many of my EPDG.  I'm keeping the HOF, but it's just not a winnable fight to collect everyone of them with so many low pop and unconfirmed cards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the following cards all have combined PSA/SGC populations of 5 or fewer.  Note that the Murray was cracked out of an SGC 10 holder, so in this instance, the card is included in that population.\r\n\r\nOpen to offers... don't really have a price in mind for them.  If there's another non-HOF you need that's in my collection, feel free to make an offer there as well:\r\nFiene Portrait\r\nFiene Throwing\r\nHallman\r\nMurray Portrait\r\nOakes\r\nSnodgrass Catching\r\nStephens\r\nStovall Portrait\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/8946/fiene-lou-portrait[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/8947/fiene-lou-throwing[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/7221/hallman-bill[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/11687/murray-red-portrait[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/8949/oakes-rebel[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/11838/snodgrass-fred-catching[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/8951/stephens-jim[/IMG][IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/t206hound/epdg/9186/stovall-george-portrait[/IMG]",
