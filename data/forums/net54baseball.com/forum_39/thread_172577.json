      "post_content": "I have a low grade lot of 23 different T206 Polar Bear backs. The highlights are a Gandil, Chase/Trophy and a Rucker with a very small miscut. Pictured Happy Smith because it is one of the nicer ones. Asking $345 for the lot, which is a good price that reflects the low grade nature of the other 19 cards(figure $10-12 each, but 4-5 are worth more)\r\n\r\n  All the others are listed below:\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Armbruster, Jack Barry, Batch, Carrigan, Casey, Clymer, Cravath, L.Doyle/batting, Harry Davis, Leifield/batting, LaPorte, Overall/hand face, Scott, Slagle, Street/catching, Doc White, Wright, Wiltsie/port cap",
