Random red scan included for comparison only, isn't mine/isn't for sale. Make me an offer on it, or if you know the value of it and just want to be a friend, let me know. Thanks\r\n\r\n  On the Moran, it is a nice big color shift, blurry pic, sov 350 back. The yellow shifts way into the one border, on the other side, everything shifts a little the other way. Nice card. $125 SOLD",
