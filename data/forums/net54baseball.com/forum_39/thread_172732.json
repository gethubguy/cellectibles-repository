      "post_content": "Guys........For sale is my t206 Lajoie w/bat that has been slabbed PSA 'A' due to the lower left corner damage. Card has great image, color and centering, but corner appears to have been 'chewed on' by something long ago. Card displays nicely. Shipped price is $consigned to Sterling auction.\r\n\r\n**Payment by Paypal 'gift' preferred. PM me here or email me at mattpienta at yahoo dot com with questions or to purchase. Thanks.........Matt",
