      "post_content": "Hello all. Up for sale is a beautiful T206 Fred Merkle (Throwing) graded a BVG 4. The card looks great, and even has a neat wet sheet transfer. The transfer is quite prominent and one can see it well in person. Part of the \"Tolstoi\" letters actually appear on the front of the card, as well as the back frame. The card is [STRIKE]$225[/STRIKE], [STRIKE]$210[/STRIKE], [STRIKE]$189[/STRIKE], NOW $169 or best offer, shipping included. I will also consider T206 trades. I'm looking for a Lajoie, Tinker, Walsh, Baker, or any other Hall of Famers/Southern Leaguers basically. Thank you all for looking and have a nice night.\r\n\r\nNote: Unfortunately Beckett made a mistake on the label. It is labeled Sweet Caporal, but actually the back is Tolstoi.",
