      "post_content": "Hey everyone,\r\n    Up for sale is a beautiful t206 Mordecai Brown t206 (Chicago on Shirt). It's a great card, and would grade higher if it didn't have the punch hole. Anyways, I would really like to try to upgrade this card. I would also be interested in Cubs on shirt or the Portrait version. Please PM some offers. I am looking for one in 2 or 3 condition, or even a raw version that would grade good - very good. Thank you once again! If you need better photos, please let me know!",
