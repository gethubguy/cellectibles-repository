Looking to move these three Buffalo players individually.\n\n[URL=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/T206ster/media/img423_zpsa9790af6.gif.html][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/img423_zpsa9790af6.gif[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/T206ster/media/Buffalo-Backs_zpsb5d721ec.gif.html][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/Buffalo-Backs_zpsb5d721ec.gif[/IMG][/URL]\n\nAside from the things you can readily see, Brain has a severe bend in him, visible from both sides, that makes him limp. Hold him from top or bottom, and he will droop.\n\nHoping to $20 each for the cards. Includes postage. Buy 2 and take $2 off total. Buy all three ... you get the idea. Or just shoot me an offer on any or all.\n\nWhat better time to try and sell common cards in poor condition than when everyone is looking forward to the National?\n\nThanks.",
