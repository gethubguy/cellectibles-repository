I thought it would be a good idea to create a thread here where t206 collectors can post what they are looking for and hopefully find a match. It's basically a want list. There are previous threads like this, which worked really well, but are not used anymore. So let me start off. I am looking for:\n\n    Hall of Famers (Basically any; SGC or PSA 2,3,4 condition please)\n    Southern Leaguers (Basically any)\n    Tough Commons (Ganley, Dahlen, etc.)\n    Hindu Backs \n\nJust some ideas. Please, post your want list and hopefully we can find a match! Best regards.",
