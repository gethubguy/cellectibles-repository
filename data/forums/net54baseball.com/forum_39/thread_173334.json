      "post_content": "I have these cards below for $10 each. I scanned some randomly so you can get an idea of condition. If the front looks real nice, it probably has back damage. Please pay by paypal(no fees) and include $2 for shipping for less than five(5) cards, otherwise shipping is on me. For the cards I have multiple copies of, first to ask will get the one I think presents nicer. No group discounts because the price is already low on them, unless you want all of them, then I'll throw one in for free. Have fun and if you want cheaper cards, there are beaters below for $8 each\r\n\r\n Ames/trimmed, Anderson, Bradley/bat, Burch, Cross(on hold), Davidson, Harry Davis/Davis front, Doyle/bat, Fiene/throw(on hold), Fletcher, Geyer, Goode(on hold), Herzog/NY, Hoblitzell, Hofman/chi(ugly card, but tougher than a common), Howard/chi(on hold), Howell/port, Isbell, Kisinger, Knight/port, Lake/ ny pitch, Laporte, McElveen(2), Mullin/bat, O'Leary/port, Purtell(on hold), Ritter, Rhodes/ nice looking-trimmed, Rucker/port(2), Rucker/pitch(on hold), Schaeffer/wash, Schlei/bat, Schlei/catch(2), Schrenk, Seymour/pitch, Shaw/prov, trimmed, Shipke(on hold), Stephens(punch hole/pictured), Street/port(punch hole/pictured), Tannehill/follow thru(on hold), Unglaub(2), Willett/bat, Wiltsie/port(on hold), Wright/port\r\n\r\nSome beaters for $8: Fromme/trim, Jones/stl, Jones/port, Malarkey(on hold), Oberlin, Payne, Happy Smith(on hold), Theilman, Wilhelm/bat",
