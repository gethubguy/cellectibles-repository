There is also a tear which is best viewed on the back stretching from the left edge just above the \"cigarettes\" banner. It travels right up to the left side of the laurel wreath.\n\nSince they started keeping track of back types, PSA has graded only 217 Carolina Brights. By comparison they've graded 590 Brown Hindus and 188 Broadleaf 350's. It's a very tough back.\n\nFirst EMAIL or PM saying I'll take it, gets it.\n\nMy email:  [url]boboinnes33@gmail.com[/url]",
