I have no T206's right now but recently bought a 10 card lot of beaters to start my T206 collection and will get 2 Jimmy Slagle cards and would trade one of them for the red bordered Walsh card.\r\n\r\nOn a different note I see you collect Ellis Burks. I have a super rare 1990 Ellis Burks/Steve Lake Score wrong back pair. These are some of the rarest error cards there are. If interested in them let me know and we can discuss details.",
