      "post_content": "I would like to trade this T206 EDDIE COLLINS SGC 30 straight up for an equivalent EDDIE COLLINS in a PSA holder. \r\n\r\nMy collection is entirely PSA and for continuity reasons I feel obligated to keep it that way...so rather than resubmit for regrading (which for a single card would apparently run nearly $30) I would rather trade.\r\n\r\nI only have a scan of the front here at work but can add a back scan later. It is a clean back though.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy",
