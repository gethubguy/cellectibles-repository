      "post_content": "Hi everyone. Here is the short list of the last 18 true common bits of the Monster that I need. I need a few others that are listed as commons but we all know that they aren't.:D. Anyway, I am looking for common backs and my first choice would be \"raw\". PSA3 or SGC40 would work also and should be used as  a benchmark for the raw as well. A LITTLE shy of the mark MIGHT be do-able but anything better will squeeze the budget.:) Thanks in advance to any respondents. PM me and I am sure we could work something out.....Mike\r\nHere are the 18 stragglers. \r\n\r\n1. Ed Abbaticchio (Blue Sleeves) GOT 'EM....eBay\r\n45.
