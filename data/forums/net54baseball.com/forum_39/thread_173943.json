It doesn't really fit my theme though.  I'm looking for T206's, OR autographs of T206 players (on index cards).  If this interests anyone, please let me know.  Would sell this card or simply trade it.  Looking for any and all T206 player autographs; none are too big or too small as I have just started out.  Please be advised it is only for the card on the right (not the autographed T206).  If this card (I don't even know what card this is??) interests you, please PM me.  Once again I have posted it here because I am using it as trade bait for T206s/T206 player autographs.  Thanks! SOLD",
