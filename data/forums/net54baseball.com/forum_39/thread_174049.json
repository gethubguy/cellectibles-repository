Cycle 350\r\nCy Seymour- portrait ... Tolstoi\r\nDoc White- portrait ... Sovereign 350\r\n(2) Bill Carrigan ... Sovereign 350\r\n\r\nI prefer to just sell them as one batch for $200 or so, and I will cover shipping expenses, but if that does not materialize, we discuss individual cards.\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\nDerek",
