I won't bump the threads relentlessly.\n\nHere is what is left from Lot 190 in the recent SCP auction.  Smallish scans can be found here:\n\n[url]https://catalog.scpauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=25208[/url]\n\nThese prices are based on recent sales from VCP and Card Target.  Whatever doesn't sell here will go on ebay with BIN-prices a little higher than these.  Payment by paypal (split the fees, please) or check or M.O. \n\nPlease keep in mind that the cards will not be in my hands for 1-2 weeks. \n\n1909-11 T206 Johnson (Pitching) Sweet Caporal 350 ad back.
