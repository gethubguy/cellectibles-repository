      "post_content": "This card actually has three printing errors, maybe four.  First, the obvious blue color shift that is both too far right and too low at the bottom, below the outline (see enlarged scan).  There is a second color shift involving the yellow.  A look at the lower left corner reveals that the yellow is too far to the left.  The double color shift causes an interesting look at the borders on the lower half of the card.    Also, part of the \"A\" and part of the \"M\" are missing in his name.  Compare to other examples of this card and the difference is clearly evident.  Finally, I have no idea what caused the extra line in the lower right corner.  Maybe someone else can figure that out.  An interesting card.  $150 delivered.\n\nMark\n[url]drumback2@cox.net[/url]",
