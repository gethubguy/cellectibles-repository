      "post_content": "More cards from a collection of a longtime hobbyist. These have been tucked away in an album for the past three decades or so.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't subscribe to the theory of pricing an item on the B/S/T at double what you reasonably hope to get, then reducing it by 5 or 10 percent and bumping the listing for \"price reductions\" every 2-3 days. Am I sometimes guilty of overvaluing (and undervaluing) a card? Sure. But I list stuff at prices I hope will result in quick sales. So though I would never tell someone not to email me an offer of $20 on a $22 card, unless it's the last card remaining, chances are pretty good your offer will be declined. There are plenty of other folks on 54 who will be happy to play Pawn Stars with you, and those sellers are very easy to identify. Thanks.\r\n\r\n(I should add, if you honestly feel a price is way out of line, email me. The worst that I can say is no.)\r\n\r\nPrices are delivered within the United States. PayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment. A commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com [/URL]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nArmbruster, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nBresnahan, Sweet Caporal 350, Factory 30: [STRIKE]$60[/STRIKE] $50\r\n\r\nChance (portrait), Piedmont 150: SOLD\r\n\r\nChance (batting), Piedmont 350-460: SOLD\r\n\r\nCovaleski, Sweet Caporal 150, Factory 30: SOLD\r\n\r\nDessau, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nHinchman, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nHoffman, Piedmont 350: [STRIKE]$24[/STRIKE] $18\r\n\r\nJoss (portrait), Piedmont 150: SOLD\r\n\r\nJoss (throwing), Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nMcGinnity, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nMerkle, Sweet Caporal 350-460, Factory 30: SOLD\r\n\r\nOberlin, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\nSmith (Buffalo), Sweet Caporal 350, Factory 30: [STRIKE]$24[/STRIKE] $18\r\n\r\nWaddell, Piedmont 150: SOLD\r\n\r\nWarhop, Piedmont 350: SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/t206-fronts.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/t206backs.jpg[/IMG]",
