Both are P150 back. \r\n\r\nBack is immaculate centered. I actually hate when people up sell their cards as the next highest grade but it is a real nice looking 4 if I recall correctly. I have a Beaumont PSA 5 in my back run so I'm not absolutely certian.\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://thehoodedcoder.com/images/displayimage-250.html&fullsize=1\"]Cy Young Portrait SGC 60[/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://thehoodedcoder.com/images/thumbnails-12.html\"]Other cards[/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\nKevin",
