Sam Crawford throwing about fair condition, 4 pinholes on border, corner wear, small scrape on back resulting paper loss $30\r\n\r\n$90 shipped for both. \r\n\r\nSince I do not have a scanner and my camera is worthless for clear pics, I would be willing to ship first to established members. If you like the cards, you send me a check, if not, send them back.\r\n\r\n I cannot take paypal, sorry.\r\n\r\nPM if interested.",
