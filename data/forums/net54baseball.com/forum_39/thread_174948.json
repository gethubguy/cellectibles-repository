I CAN afford all 36, just not all 36 AND a divorce lawyer:D I am looking for cards that present well.  Raw is my preference but slabbed would work. SGC 20/30 or the equivalent is the range I am looking for. SGC A could be an option if the card has good eye appeal.  Shoot me a PM and we will work something out. I will put this post on hold should I run out of money or if the wife blows a gasket.:D Thanks in advance to all who may respond.\r\n\r\nHere is the Triple Dozen:\r\n\r\n25.
