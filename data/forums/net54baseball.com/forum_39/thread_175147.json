      "post_content": "Hi, I would like to sell my Stephens T206.  It is in rough condition.  I was bidding on T213-2's on ebay and I bid on this one before I realized it wasn't a Coupon.  I didn't want to retract my bid, so I am now selling it for less than I paid for it on ebay.  Oh well - no brains = no headaches.\r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n9 bucks shipped.  Cash, MO's, checks, paypal, whatever works for you.\r\n\r\nThanks, Rick",
