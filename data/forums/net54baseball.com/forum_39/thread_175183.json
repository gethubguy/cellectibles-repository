      "post_content": "I've removed the many cards that sold and have significantly reduced prices on the two authentic Hall of Famers and the lower-grade Marquard. I would say these are \"FINAL PRICE REDUCTIONS,\" but that phrase has been rendered a bit of a joke.\r\n\r\nJust back from SGC, more cards that have been tucked away for three-plus decades in a collection of a longtime hobbyist. Those of you who know me know I don't care much for hyperbole, especially when it comes to selling cardboard. That said, as I've gone through my friend's collection getting cards ready to sell, this group of T206s, which were in a different album than most of his other cards, really caught my eye because of their bright colors. \r\n\r\nPrices are delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.:rolleyes:\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. \r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com [/URL]\r\n\r\nHALL OF FAMERS\r\n\r\nT206 Eddie Collins, Piedmont 350, SGC 60/5: $430\r\n\r\nT206 Jimmy Collins, Piedmont 350, SGC \"A\": [STRIKE]$75[/STRIKE] $55\r\n\r\nT206 Rube Marquard (hands at thighs), Sweet Caporal 150 (Factory 25), SGC 35/2.5 SOLD\r\n\r\nT206 John McGraw (portrait with cap), Polar Bear, SGC \"A\": [STRIKE]$80[/STRIKE] $70\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/1_2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/1a.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/2_2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/2a.jpg[/IMG]",
