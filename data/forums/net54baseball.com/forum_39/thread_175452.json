      "post_content": "Thank you, Kevin.  \r\n\r\nI was asked if this card has any creases, so I looked at it pretty thoroughly under my loupe.  Yes, it does have a crease on the bottom left corner.  It's very faint on the front, but pretty obvious on the back, so I'll call it a back crease.  However, another thing I noticed (that I never saw before) is this card has a partial name on top.  It's hard to see from the scan, but it is there.  I thought this fact might generate more interest.  \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nDavid",
