Any reasonable offer will be accepted, especially with a group purchase and as you can see in the first post, the prices were pretty cheap to begin with. Once Monday/noon hits, anything left won't be for sale for awhile so this is the last chance to get any of these cards. I'm willing to listen to offers.  All 42 can be had for $625 dlvd(paypal gift) That is almost $200 off the combined asking price. I'll lower that combined price if individual cards sell.\n\nSOLD CARDS: Atz, Bell/wind up, Bliss, Bowerman, Brain, Clymer, Congalton, Demmitt, Jordan, Lake, McGlynn, Merritt, Murray, Pickering, Rhoades, Stahl, Thomas",
