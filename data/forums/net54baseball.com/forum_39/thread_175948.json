Kind of hated \"hoping\" for it to be \"downgraded\", but it didn't happen any way... oh well.\r\n\r\nAlso have the following on the way:\r\nBeckley - A\r\nBender Portrait - 30\r\nCamnitz Arms Folded - 35\r\nChase Dark Cap - 50\r\nDorner - 60\r\nMolly Miller Piedmont - 60\r\n\r\nAnd the \"double strike\" Anderson - 50",
