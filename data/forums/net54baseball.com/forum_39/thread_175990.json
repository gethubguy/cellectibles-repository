      "post_content": "Looking to trade this miscut Boss Schmidt T206 Sweet Caporal back for a few low grade T206 cards that I could use for my set.  It's not in the best shape but it has a full name and the start of the portrait on top from the miscut, fairly drastic.  If you collect these (I personally don't, it just came along in a group I purchased) and have some commons you would like to trade for it, shoot me a message.  Thanks.",
