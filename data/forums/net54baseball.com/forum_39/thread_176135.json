I have a dupe Lefty Leifield Pitching P150 F25 SGC 30.  \r\n\r\nI would like to trade for the same card in a Sweet Cap Back (any except sc350f30 which I have).\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is any interest.  I would also consider a trade for any other Pirate players/back combinations I need for my team set.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nCliff\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=115105&d=1379861636[/IMG]",
