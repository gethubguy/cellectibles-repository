There are a few spider wrinkles in the middle. But you need to tilt the card to see them. Nice card for a VG grade collector.\r\n\r\nBirdie Cree: Price:$40\r\nVery nice card, VG-Ex with excellent color and registration and no creases\r\n\r\nIf you would like all three cards, I'll sell them all for $100.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-008b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-008rb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-014b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-014rb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-111b.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-111rb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI accept checks, money orders and Paypal.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\nCy\r\n[url]cy@cyscards.com[/url]",
