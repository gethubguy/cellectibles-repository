Unfortunately, the grade seems to have dropped due to tiny specs of paper loss on the back (see image).  \r\n\r\nPriced very reasonably at SOLD delivered.  Payment through PayPal.  Fee covered by buyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1349.photobucket.com/user/setbuilder1/media/Joss1_zps336a033b.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1349.photobucket.com/albums/p759/setbuilder1/Joss1_zps336a033b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1349.photobucket.com/user/setbuilder1/media/Joss2_zps96933bd4.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1349.photobucket.com/albums/p759/setbuilder1/Joss2_zps96933bd4.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
