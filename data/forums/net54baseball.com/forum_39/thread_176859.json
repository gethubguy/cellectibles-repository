      "post_content": "$125 delivered.  There is some soiling (mostly on the back) that accounts for the lower grade.  It could easily be soaked if that's your kind of thing.  According to CardTarget, the last SGC 40 sold for $141.89 and the last PSA 3 sold for $139.99.  My price is very fair and very firm.  Payment to be made via PayPal gift, check or money order.  Regular PayPal certainly okay, but please add 3%.",
