I have a T206 Mordecai Brown Portrait: El Principe De Gales back available for trade. \r\n\r\nPlease note that SGC does not slab cards were the name has been cut off. This is their policy, which I was previously unaware of. From what I can tell, the no name is not a result of any alteration, but a result of the factory cut. However, I will leave that to the experts.\r\n\r\nAnyways, if anyone thinks that this would fit into their collection, I would be interested in a trade. I collect T206 Hall Of Fame Players and cool tobacco backs. Give me a holler if you would like to try a trade.\r\n\r\nThank You Very Much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
