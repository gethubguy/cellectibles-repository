Should have fairly nice centering (does not need to be perfect), minor creasing is ok so long as it does not take away from the eye appeal. No paper loss please.\r\n\r\nPM or post here if you have anything available. Please include a scan and what you're looking for delivered.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\nCard has been purchased. Thanks again, Rob!",
