      "post_content": "HI Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am considering selling one of my major T206 freaks... A severe front miscut is extremely tough to find. (only about 10 are known to exist). This card is of Tom Needham, it has an EPDG back.. the only severe front miscut with an EPDG back to my knowledge...as you can see from the scans.. the card is miscut on both the front and back... the card used to be in the unknown slab (3rd picture below).. but I had it graded by SGC.. so it now resides in the SGC slab you see in the first 2 pictures...The card has a near mint appearance.. no paper loss, no creases, and sharp corners.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the card, please email me at [url]blunder19@aol.com[/url] and we can discuss further. \r\n\r\n**Please note I no longer own the Snoodgrass so please no inquiries about that card**\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s251.photobucket.com/user/blunder19/media/miscut2_zps7b186ca8.jpg.html][IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/miscut2_zps7b186ca8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n[URL=http://s251.photobucket.com/user/blunder19/media/miscut1_zps8dc19e1f.jpg.html][IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/miscut1_zps8dc19e1f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n[URL=http://s251.photobucket.com/user/blunder19/media/epdgmiscut.jpg.html][IMG]http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg309/blunder19/epdgmiscut.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
