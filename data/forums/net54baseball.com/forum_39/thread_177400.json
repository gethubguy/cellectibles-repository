But it makes no sense to make a needless post that results only in other seller's threads being bumped down. Thanks, Rob\r\n\r\nI received a couple emails about these -- even before I posted, which is kind of strange. Sorry, I'm not open to a trade.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to PM or [URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]email me[/URL].\r\n\r\nPrices are delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com[/URL]\r\n\r\nBrain SOLD\r\n\r\nGandil SOLD",
