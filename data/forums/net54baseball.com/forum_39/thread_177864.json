      "post_content": "Well, due to some personal circumstances, I'm considering selling my mini-T206 graded card collection with awesome eye appeal. As you can see, many of the cards received lower than expected grade for reasons unknown\r\n\r\nIn terms of $, I'll take $SOLD (price added 10/27) and if I can't get it might break up into singles next week. \r\n\r\nMost of the backs are fine, a couple/few have tobacco staining. I do not think any of these cards have creases.  (Don't mind sending back scans to serious potential buyers.)\r\n\r\nP.S. Thank you to board members who sold me a few of these cards as I appreciate enjoying them but may have to part with them (I did not buy them with the intention of resale but for personal reasons may release them).\r\n\r\nPM me if interested....\r\n\r\nLink: [URL=\"http://www.collectorfocus.com/browse_collections/user_collection/847/190/0\"]http://www.collectorfocus.com/browse_collections/user_collection/847/190/0[/URL]",
