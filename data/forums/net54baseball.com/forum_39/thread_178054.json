They were fascinated when I showed them Eds \r\nWikipedia page and would like to get a few of these gentlemen \r\ngraded examples of Ed. Would consider raw cards as well but for these\r\nguys I think graded works better.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nFrank",

It's funny that I found Abbaticchio to be a tougher one when building the Monster. Even now when I buy lots to upgrade my set, I don't find either card in there very often.",
