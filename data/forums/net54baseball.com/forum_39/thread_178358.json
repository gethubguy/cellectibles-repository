      "post_content": "I picked up two pages from a scrap book.  The interior of the book was dated 1942 however the glue is clear and seems to be cemet and when I tried to soak the one card I skinned the back.  That being said I do not know if they can be removed and I figured I would try them here before I started skinning some really nice cards.  There are about 85+ cards on both sheets, most T206 but a few other odds and ends.\r\n\r\nPrice is $6000 for the lot.\r\n\r\nThis large sheet has cards on both sides\r\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/t206sheet.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/t206sheetbk.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis smaller sheet had the loose cards cut from the bottom area.\r\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/t206.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.thetoyheaven.com/images/items/baseballcards/t206sheetsmall.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAny questions LMK.  Thanks\r\n\r\nJames G",
