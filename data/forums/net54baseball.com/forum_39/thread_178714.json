There's a very small pencil mark on the back, but the registration, color and surface are beautiful. A very slight diamond cut, but that should grade nicely. The Eddie Collins and Chief Bender portraits are really nice, too. And the Evers port is quite nice; a very minor crease on the front. \r\n\r\nIf a forum member bought this, and is selling the Eddie Collins, pm me please.",
