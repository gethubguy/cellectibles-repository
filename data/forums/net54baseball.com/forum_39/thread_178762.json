      "post_content": "Hi all. I'm looking for an Eddie Collins at the end of the month. SGC 40-45 range, with nice eye appeal, or a similar ungraded. Well centered, clean surface. I'm less concerned about corner wear, or minor edge wear.\r\n\r\nIf you have one for sale, please PM me with links to scans of the front and back, and let me know what you're looking for it. I'd prefer to buy it on the 27th, but if there's one available now, I can make payment immediately. My preferred method of payment is Paypal goods and services, and I have no problem paying the extra 3%. I can certainly send a check (personal or certified), or a money order if that is your preference. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nBill",
