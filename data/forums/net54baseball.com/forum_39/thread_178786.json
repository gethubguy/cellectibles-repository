      "post_content": "When I put together a T206 Polar Bear subset, Joe Doyle and Irv Young were among the final cards I was able to find. Purely anecdotal, I know, so take it for what it's worth. Was able to upgrade recently, hence the reason they're for sale. The Eddie Collins was recently graded and comes from a raw collection of a longtime collector. Color looks a bit washed out in my scan. The background is more vibrant in person.\r\n\r\nEddie Collins, SGC 60/5: $335\r\n\r\nJoe Doyle. BVG 3: SOLD\r\n\r\nIrv Young, PSA 2.5: $50\r\n\r\nPrices delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com [/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/eddie-collins.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/doyle-pb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/irv-young-pb.jpg[/IMG]",
