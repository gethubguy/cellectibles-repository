      "post_content": "I could be wrong, but I don't believe an example has publicly surfaced for a sale in quite some time (since 2008). \r\n\r\nGraded SGC 45 3.5. It didn't grade a 4+ because there is a wrinkle that is hard to notice if you're not looking for it. It is near the lower right hand corner and only visible from the back, though if looking at the front knowing there is a wrinkle, you can barely see a slight bend. It's even hard to notice in these scans (from my Epson V33 Perfection if anyone is wondering).\r\n\r\nPrice for right now is [STRIKE]$1750[/STRIKE] $1550delivered. Payment via any method you prefer. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like better scans, email me at: \r\n\r\n[url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks all!",
