Also, when I hold the card in my hand, the colors don't seem as vibrant as the example of this card I have in my collection.\r\n\r\nWait, this is the B/S/T. What am I doing focusing on the flaws? Shouldn't I be waxing eloquently about the fantastic corners? (Also, I'm able to post my own scans. What's up with that?)\r\n\r\nBottom line: Decent-looking card, not a beater, not a Sweet Cap or Piedmont back and a HOFer.\r\n\r\nPrice is $xxx delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com [/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/frank-baker.jpg[/IMG]",
