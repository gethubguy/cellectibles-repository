Please contact me if there is anything you have interest in. I'm never offended or insulted by an offer, and will also quote you a price off eBay (via normal PayPal) if you'd prefer. I couldn't care less if someone offers a \"lowball\" offer, as I only consider it what the buyer is willing to pay. I'll respond regardless. \n\nPayment would be through normal PayPal. \n\n[URL=\"http://stores.ebay.com/The-Cards-of-Our-Pastime/T-Cards-Tobacco-Graded-/_i.html?_fsub=6363337015&_sid=159857865&_trksid=p4634.c0.m322\"]T Cards Graded (142 Cards, 129 are T206)[/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://stores.ebay.com/The-Cards-of-Our-Pastime/T-Cards-Tobacco-Raw-/_i.html?_fsub=6457034015&_sid=159857865&_trksid=p4634.c0.m322\"]T Cards Raw (240 Cards, 237 are T206)[/URL]\n\n\n\nContact me at [url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url]\n\n\n.",
