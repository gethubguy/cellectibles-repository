I actually posted on here back in 2010 I think, but it looks like it was all archived/deleted.\r\n\r\nSomeone has been nice enough to reach out and offer me a free t206 beater, so I'll hold off on buying any until I get that one.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any threads here of people's progress in putting together a low grade set? I'd be curious to know the approximate cost involved, time it took, etc. I'm well aware this is a 'marathon' and would cost a lot of money, but I'd be curious to read people's stories of their attempts at it.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
