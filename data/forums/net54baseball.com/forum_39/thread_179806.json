      "post_content": "Hello. In the spirit of all the wild offseason activity in baseball right now (if the Mets do not get a power bat soon, I am going to lose my mind), I would like to post a trade proposal on net 54, because lets face it ... this is where the action is!\n\nI have a batch of seven T206 cards, including some HOF with a few of the more exotic backs in the set. What I would like to do is to \"trade up\" for a big power slugger (Broad Leaf, Carolina, perhaps? :) ...) to someone who is looking to \"trade down\" for a batch of veterans and a few prospects. You get can get the following 7 cards in the trade:\n\n1.) Fred Clarke (HOF) \"Holding Bat\": Brown Hindu ... SGC A (there is a trim on the bottom [not done by me!], but it is actually kind of a nice looking card in my opinion ... gotta love the sleeves!)\n\n2.) John McGraw (HOF) \"Portrait-No Cap\": Brown Hindu ... SGC 1 (a decent looking front with \"Fredrick Benedict Gessner\" stamped on the back, and \"Princeton\" written in a calligraphy style writing also on the back ... kind of an interesting one, and the second Brown Hindu I have seen with this mans name stamped on the back ... does anyone know who this guy was?).\n\n3.) Miller Huggins (HOF) \"Hands At Mouth\": American Beauty 350 {Frame} ... PSA 3\n\n4.) Miller Huggins (HOF) \"Hands At Mouth\": Tolstoi ... PSA 3\n\n5.) Sam Crawford (HOF) \"With Bat\": American Beauty 350 {No Frame} ... SGC 3\n\n6.) Addie Joss (HOF) \"Pitching\": El Principe De Gales ... SGC 1\n\n7.) Nap Rucker \"Portrait\": El Principe De Gales ... PSA 3\n\n\n\nIf you have any interest in acquiring this group, feel free to shoot me a PM, and I will respond to you with details on scans.\n\nMy interests are the tougher backs like Carolina Brights, Broad Leaf, Lenox, Red Hindu \n\nThanks guys.\n\nDerek",

It is in an SGC A holder because I think it may have been given a trim on the bottom at one point (not by me). IF you happen to like T3's, you can add the card to the deal.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nDerek",
