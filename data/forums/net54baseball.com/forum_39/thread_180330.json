      "post_content": "Hello.  I have the following card available for sale or trade.  This is the T206 Bill O'Hara, St. Louis variation, with a Polar Bear back.  Excellent opportunity to pick up one of the \"Big 6\" cards in the set for a reasonable price.  The card has been graded SGC Authentic, and has obvious condition issues.  There is a piece of the right border missing as well as two pinholes and what appears to be a couple of razor slashes near the right and left borders.  The player image itself is relatively unaffected by these issues though, so I'd call it a presentable beater overall.\r\n\r\nThe price is **SOLD** and I would consider trades for other similarly valued cards.  \r\n\r\nI accept payment via any method you prefer.  Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase the card or with any additional questions.  Thanks for looking!",
