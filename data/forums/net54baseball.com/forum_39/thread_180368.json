      "post_content": "Looking to get into the set and want to buy a large lot (~100) to start. I have nothing, so I can start with anything. Looking for a large lot of raw commons, not too concerned with condition right now. With that said, I'm fine with some paper loss on the back, but don't want cards missing corners, trimmed, holes, markings, etc. Still fine with poor copies. \n\nMay be open to some low grade PSA HOF'ers as well (only the top HOFers - Cobb, Matthewson, Young, Johnson etc. to start)\n\nFeel free to post here or PM me. Thanks.",
