      "post_content": "I've owned a few T206 related domain names for quite some time and now I'm looking to sell them.  I had grand illusions of developing a T206 collector related portal site complete with email, image hosting, etc.  Unfortunately life got in the way and I never got around to it.  These are the domain names:\r\n\r\nT206BaseballCards.com\r\nT206BaseballCards.org\r\nT206BaseballCards.info\r\nT206BaseballCards.net   \r\n\r\nI would like to offer these names to the collector community to see if there is any interest.  Hopefully they could go to someone that would put them to good use.  I know they have some value but I have no idea what they're worth.  My preference is to sell them outright but I'm also open to any offers, trades or deals of any kind so please don't hesitate to contact me.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nDennis",
