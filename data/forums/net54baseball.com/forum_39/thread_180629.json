      "post_content": "Happy holidays - thanks going out to all members who have given me so much help on this t206 error card. I have been this great hobby for over 25 years. Yesterday 12/24/13 was the craziest day i have had so far in this hobby. Starting at 8am i was contacted by 4 auction houses about this card. The big three rev, bill goodwin and ken golden all of which i respect so much for their great work in this hobby. All wanted me to consign this rare card to their upcoming auction. They all made me great offers and why their company is the \"best\"choice for this rare t206. We all agree that this card is triple struck. But i'm getting emails that it may have been struck 4x. I have attached one new photo upside down.\r\n What do you think?\r\n\r\nI will decide this monday on the auction house that i will consign to for their upcoming auction in 2014. Estimate on this card is now $20,000 - $25,000 by two of the mentioned above.\r\n\r\nMembers, please look again at the new photo and let me know what you think. Triple strike or quadruple strike. Thanks",

I moved this one also. \r\n\r\nI am not very good at determining the number of overprints on these (my only one, I am still unsure if it has 4, 5 or some other number) but since we are here I don't think yours is more than a 10k card. I think 8-10k....but I have been wrong so maybe am this time too..... And if yours is a 20k card what does that make this one? (shown for the OP as he might not have seen it.) Whomever is telling you it's a 20k-25k card, have them buy it from you at that price :). ..I hope you get as much as you can for it and thanks again for posting. Glad the forum has been able to help a bit..regards\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/pt206ghostmultioverprint2.jpg[/IMG]",

As I said my educated guess 5-8.5k. But I guess anything can happen. \r\n\r\nAlso I won\u2019t be bidding and have no interest in the card short of trying to put you and Jim B together for his Wiliis run. So I\u2019m one guy out of the picture in terms of driving the price up\u2026.\r\n\r\nMike also I think it\u2019s time to just pick an auction house or what you want to do privately. I understand you\u2019re excited about the sale and that\u2019s really cool for you. :)\r\n\r\nHowever to me there\u2019s fine line of using the BST for sales or using the BST/Board for publicity. A hundred threads on how many strikes it has, the folks you have talked too, your market estimates etc. isn\u2019t going to make your card go for more. Not trying to sound mean but if everyone started multiple threads promoting their own items that may go to auction etc. it sort of defeats the purpose of the BST IMO. Perhaps Leon disagrees?\r\n\r\nAlso as I said I wish you the best with the sale.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJohn",
