      "post_content": "Back in 2009 I sold a Matty McIntyre (Portrait) on eBay. It was an SGC 40 I believe and was from the Lionel Carter Collection. I no longer have scans of it as my computer crashed a couple of years ago and I lost all of my old scans,etc. \r\n\r\nIt would mean alot to me if I could purchase it back. I will pay handsomely to do so. It has more sentimental value to me then anything else. Figured I would try here and see if it turns up anything!!\r\n\r\nPlease email me at [url]TwirlerReulbach@sbcglobal.net[/url] if you can help.",
