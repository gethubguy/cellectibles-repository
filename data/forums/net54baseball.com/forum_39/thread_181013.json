This T206 subject is in the group of 460-only series guys that I refer to as the \"Exclusive 12\".\r\nThese 12 guys had to be multi-printed with respect to the other subjects in the 460-only series, as they are more available with SOVEREIGN (and other tougher) backs.\r\n\r\nCheck-out my thread on this subject............[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=163949[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh622/tedzan77/crandevdufforgangeyRHx25_zps09099928.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n.[IMG]http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh622/tedzan77/HumMcGPfeSheTanWheRHx25a_zpse49b9174.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScott....wishing you and your Dad, Hank, a very Happy New Year,\r\n\r\n\r\nTED Z",
