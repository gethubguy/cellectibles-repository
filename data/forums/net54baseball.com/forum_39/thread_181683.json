      "post_content": "Given my budget restraints while collecting the set, I often bought cards with good fronts, bad backs because I could get a beautiful card at a bargain.  This sale is for collectors who share those values.\r\nMost of these 13 have no creases, with fronts that would grade VG-EX or better and backs that I don't dwell upon.\r\nGiven what they cost me, at $185 they're a bargain.\r\n\r\nIf you want an individual card/cards, let me know and I'll give you a price. First taker gets it. \r\n\r\nMost forms of payment okay. If paypal, pay as friend; thanks.\r\n\r\nI am always looking to upgrade [Good or better], so if you're interested in trading please send me a list of what you have. I prefer ungraded cards.\r\n\r\nNo pm's, please.

Also, the cards are in two protective plastics, a halved penny-sleeve--which creates the appearance of a vertical line on each card--and a pocket-page:",
