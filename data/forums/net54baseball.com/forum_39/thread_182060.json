While I usually don't like the \"make an offer\" posts too much, in this case it makes some sense. Please PM me if interested in buying any of these beforehand...or you can wait and go to auction....The BL460 will probably stay in my collection for now....This Drum in a 2 holder should probably be resubmitted. When it was graded there were no half grades.......\r\nAll sold\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/st2063x.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/st2063xb.jpg[/IMG]",
