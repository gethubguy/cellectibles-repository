Creasing and stains are generally ok... but prefer no trimming, writing, or scribbles. Front player, quality, grade, etc isn't important.\r\n\r\nI'd also prefer to purchase several from one person to save on shipping, time, etc. Thanks for looking... let me know.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the following, not looking for any rare variations:\r\n\r\nOld Mill (both Southern and Large Assortment)\r\nCycle\r\nAmerican Beauty\r\nEPDG\r\nTolstoi\r\nHindu",
