      "post_content": "Patience has never been my strong suit.  I've been working on the Mathewson Dark Cap back run for a little while, and quite frankly I have given up.  I have a few of them for sale if interested.  I also have a few that I am going to keep :)  I am going to try this route before giving them a run at auction.  If interested let me know as I would like to seek offers:\r\n\r\nPSA 2.5 American Beauty 350\r\nSGC 10 Carolina Brights - name at top and bottom\r\nSGC 40 Sovereign 460 - name at top and bottom\r\nPSA 2 Old Mill\r\n\r\nI have some others I will post later.  If the offer thing doesn't pan out I will try to put some prices together that are more concrete.  I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible to PMs.  I don't always get a chance to look at the board but the PMs I normally get notified about quickly.",
