      "post_content": "I bought this some time back from a relative of Rube Kroh. Without doing any research I thought it might be Rube autograph though with little work I realized it most assuredly isnt. Anyways its a receipt given to Rube in 1931. It might be the closest thing to an autograph you might find of Rube Kroh whom died in 1943. Comes with a decent T206 Piedmont with an interesting back stamp. Frame is only item not included. $35 shipped\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=130323&d=1390706030[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=130324&d=1390706043[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=130325&d=1390706053[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=130326&d=1390706066[/IMG]",

I would drop a very polite letter or email and pay top $$$ if they had one.  I have Eden one but I missed it.  Thanks for consideration.\r\nBest,\r\nKit",
