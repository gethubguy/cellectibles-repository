I would like to trade this one (picture below). Graded PSA 2 Good.\r\n\r\nI would like to trade it for a T206 Sov 350 Apple Green Lefty Leifield (Batting).  I would consider a lesser grade for your troubles. \r\n\r\nthanks for looking!!  email or PM if there is any interest.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nCliff\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=130383&d=1390765860[/IMG]",
