      "post_content": "This is a cool card that I know will be appreciated here.   I listed this card on the BST last year, but still own it.  New year, new collectors, new eyes, another Chance.\r\n\r\nBright orange background, clean Hindu reverse, PSA-5. Hopefully the scans speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nSimilar examples have sold for $4k-$5k over the last few years.  I have owned this specific card for approximately 15years, bought it raw.\r\n\r\nI am looking to sell this card but am having a hard time letting it go. No rush to sell, but I'm no longer a serious T206 collector and it seems like this card deserves to be in someone else's collection at this point.  Looking to get around $4k.  Please make me an offer I can't refuse, thanks.\r\n\r\nHappy Collecting,\r\nCraig",
