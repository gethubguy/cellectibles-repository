I'm pondering a Columbus Senators T206 set since I live in Columbus and am Ohio born and raised. I'm not looking for high grade, but cards will nice eye appeal. This is an opportunity for the many T206 collectors to turn me.\r\n\r\nHere are the players I'm looking for:\r\nJosh Clark\r\nBill Clymer\r\nBunk Congalton\r\nOtto Kruger\r\nOssee Schreck\r\n\r\nLimited budget since this is just a trial run. PM or email with any good deals.\r\n\r\nSteven",
