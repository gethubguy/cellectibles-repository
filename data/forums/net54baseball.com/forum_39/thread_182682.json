      "post_content": "Hi.\r\n\r\nI am interested in acquiring both a Ty Cobb \"bat off shoulder\" and Nap Lajoie \"with bat\", with an interesting back, like Tolstoi or American Beauty, for example. The grades are of no consequence, only a nice eye appeal. \r\n\r\nTo trade, I have a handful of some nice backs such as Uzit, Lenox etc. as well as some HOF players.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, please feel free to shoot me a PM and I would be happy to try and work something out.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
