      "post_content": "The track is closed for the day.\r\n\r\nFirst I am offering an ungraded version of George Browne, the Chicago variation, with a Piedmont 150 back.  Miraculously he survived an attempted decapitation with only a transverse crease which crosses the card at the level of his thyroid gland.  I would call this card GOOD without paper loss, marks or other falderol to detract from your appreciation of this card.  Browne is SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10927/browne-g-chi[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSecond I am offering an ungraded card of Fred Tenney in his NY uniform with a Sovereign 350 back.  The front of the card presents very well with reasonably sharp corners.  The astute observer will notice a flaw even with the bottom of Fred's right ear.  This appears to be an Indianmeal moth larvae, perhaps on the wall behind Fred.  The reverse does have some paper loss in the area of the word Subjects only.  Technically this card would be considered POOR/FAIR but it presents better for the lower grade collector.  Fred is SOLD:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10962/tenney-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnd finally I am offering a lower grade Heinie Berger card with the desirable Apple Sovereign 350 back. A corner crease in the upper left of the front is more apparent on the reverse.  A second less apparent crease runs transversely from his right belt line to the left border of the card.  A speck of paper loss that interrupts the back line border of the front image on the right side of the top of the grade probably kept this one from grading a step or two higher.  If you haven't got a Heinie, this one could be yours.  Heinie is SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/14712/berger-apple-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's almost post time for the third race, Browne is favored.  It is a claiming race and he is still available for $22",
