Don't really care who is on the front.\n\nPSA 5 would be ideal but I will happily take a 5.5, 6 or 6.5 (not really interested in 4s or 7s).  Will pay a respectable above-market premium.\n\nWill also consider SGC 5.5 or higher.\n\nPM or email to sarpc at qwestoffice dot net \n\nThanks.\n\nScot Reader\n\nEDITED TO ADD:  Forgot to mention that I have some very nice cards to trade--Old Judge to Topps and a lot in-between.",
