      "post_content": "Looking to deal this as a lot before listing on eBay so please no single card offers.  See scans for detail but this lot is in mostly Poor/Fair condition with maybe a good or two snuck in. Not totally beaters though.  Includes Chance, Duffy and Smith (SL).  Backs are Piedmont, Sweet Cap, and Polar Bear.\n\nAsking $275 shipped.\n\nI will be out running errands during the day so I may not be able to reply promptly to requests for addition information but will try to get to them tonight.  Please note that a firm commitment to buy will supersede interest and inquiries in priority.  Thanks for looking!",
