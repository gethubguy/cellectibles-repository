      "post_content": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking to pick up a couple of T206 Zack Wheat cards - graded would be preferred but raw considered as well.  Something in the 2-4 range would be best.\r\n\r\nI'll consider any backs, and would pay in line with VCP averages for the respective backs (assuming eye appeal is in line with the grade as well).  I can go overpay on eBay if I wanted to, but that's not my intent.\r\n\r\nShoot me a PM if you may have any you're looking to sell.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nScott",
