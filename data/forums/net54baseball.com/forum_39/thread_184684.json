I should note that I am a nut on centering so any cards in return would have to have great centering....Maybe this will go nowhere, but here are a few I might trade, I will send scans if you email (epic1934@aol.com).  Needless to say, all have great centering...\r\n\r\nWaddell portrait    PSA 3.5\r\nBender portrait  SGC 55\r\nWillis portrait (Pirates)  SGC 50\r\nE.
