Nevertheless I am willing to consider a trade for the following card,\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/10474/mcintyre-brooklyn-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPlease draw your attention to the hideous stain on the reverse of the card, which suggests overgrading.  Despite this oversight I am sure that you can crack it out and resubmit it for a lower grade if you choose.\r\n\r\nBecause of the factors hignlighted in the first sentence of this post, an even swap would seem unfair and you might have to kick in a little cash.  Let's talk.;)",
