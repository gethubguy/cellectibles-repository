      "post_content": "im changing directions on my card collecting and want to focus more on my 1951 Bowman set (also 1950). I have 8 lower condition Boston Americans t206 cards to trade, hopefully for a small lot of bowman cards from those sets. I dont mind and even prefer lower grade Bowmans in return. (Quantity over quality.)\r\n\r\nI have:\r\nFrank Arellanes\r\nBill Carrigan\r\nRed Kleinow (in a PSA hard candy shell)\r\nHarry Lord\r\nHarry Niles\r\nTubby Spenser\r\nJake Stahl (glove)\r\nHeinie Wagner (bat on left shoulder)\r\n\r\nPm me if interested. i'll try to post pics when i get home. thanks",
