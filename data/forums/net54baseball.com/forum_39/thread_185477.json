I actually became aware of it shortly after I had made this post because another board member sent me a PM with the information.\r\n\r\nThe last few that came up at auction were not as strong as some of the previous examples, but you never know how things will turn out.\r\n\r\nGood luck if you go after this card.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJerry",
