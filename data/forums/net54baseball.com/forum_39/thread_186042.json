The T206 cards are Clancy (SC 350), Jordan (SC 350), Criss (Piedmont 150), Powell (Piedmonts 150), and Williams (Piedmont 350).\r\n\r\nThe major 1975 Topps cards I need are:\r\n#4 Al Kaline\r\n#5 Nolan Ryan\r\n#7 Bosman/Busby/Ryan\r\n#50 Brooks Robinson\r\n#60 Ferguson Jenkins\r\n#70 Mike Schmidt\r\n#80 Carlton Fisk\r\n#130 Phil Niekro\r\n#150 Bob Gibson\r\n#180 Joe Morgan\r\n#195 MVP\r\n#199 MVP\r\n#200 MVP\r\n#223 Robin Yount\r\n#228 George Brett\r\n#230 Jim Catfish Hunter\r\n#260 Johnny Bench\r\n#280 Carl Yastrzemski\r\n#300 Reggie Jackson\r\n#311 Leaders\r\n#312 Leaders\r\n#320 Pete Rose\r\n#331 Frank Robinson\r\n#335 Jim Palmer\r\n#370 Tom Seaver\r\n#386 Checklist (unmarked)\r\n#500 Nolan Ryan\r\n#517 Checklist (unmarked)\r\n#531 Cincinnati Reds team card\r\n#540 Lou Brock\r\n#561 Oakland A's team card\r\n#580 Cleveland Indians team card\r\n#600 Rod Carew\r\n#615 Rookies\r\n#618 Rookies\r\n#620 Gary Carter\r\n#622 Fred Lynn\r\n#623 Keith Hernandez\r\n#625 Boog Powell\r\n#630 Greg Luzinski\r\n#640 Harmon Killebrew\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.
