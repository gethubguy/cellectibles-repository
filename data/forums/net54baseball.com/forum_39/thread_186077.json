      "post_content": "Hello fellow board members. \r\n\r\nI am interested in working on my T206 collection and would like to explore trade possibilities with anyone who may have interest. One thing net54 never fails to deliver on is action and conversation.\r\n\r\nAs far as condition is concerned, I am not too picky when all is said and done, though I most likely would not be interested in a \"beater\". If it is necessary for cash to be involved, that is fine as well.\r\n\r\nI am currently interested in adding the following subjects, with the following backs:\r\n\r\nWalter Johnson \"Portrait\" ... Brown Hindu\r\nCy Young \"Portrait\" ... Brown Hindu\r\nTy Cobb \"Bat Off\" ... El Principe or Tolstoi\r\nNap Lajoie \"With Bat\" ... El Principe or Tolstoi\r\n\r\nA few pieces which I have available in trade:\r\n\r\nTris Speaker ... Carolina Brights\r\nJohnny Evers \"Chicago\" ... Broad Leaf 350\r\nOrval Overall \"Hands at face, yellow sunset\" ... Uzit\r\nAl Bridwell \"Portrait, with cap\" ... Lenox\r\nChief Bender \"Portrait\" ... El Principe De Gales\r\nHal Chase \"Portrait, blue\" ... El Principe De Gales\r\nMatty McIntyre ... Cycle\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIf you have a potential match and are interested in possibly working a deal out, please feel free to send me a PM. I have scans available upon request.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek :eek:",
