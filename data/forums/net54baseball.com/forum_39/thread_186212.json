I decided that I'd rather have another HOFer for my HOF Collection than having 2 of the same guy.  So, if you have something up for grabs from any E or T cards in the $100 - $300 range, please let me know as I'd like to try and make a trade. I might also consider HOF RCs as well (Exhibits, Topps, Bowman, E and T, etc.) Thanks!\r\n\r\nJimi",
