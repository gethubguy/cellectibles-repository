      "post_content": "The 3rd card on the top row came from a collection of PD350 backs including a Lundgren. I used it as a filler so you can use your imagination like I did.  Cards 9 and 10 both have Ganley's name at the top and bottom of the card.  Card 16 contains a wet sheet transfer of a Sweet Cap back.  The only trimmed card is #15 on the first sheet.\r\n\r\nAs you know, this is a less common card.  Sold as lot only.\r\n\r\nShipping and insurance add $12 for a total of $662 for the lot(pending). Email questions and interest to [url]esharpwork@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nPaypal gift - [url]h8ful21@yahoo.com[/url]  *references available if needed\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nEric",
