I don't own one and would like to so not all that concerned with who the player is, would just like to own a Hindu at a decent price.  I would be willing to pay around $200 or a little more for it.  Shoot me an email [url]rocarroll@email.com[/url] and a pic of it and lets discuss. \r\n\r\nThanks!",
