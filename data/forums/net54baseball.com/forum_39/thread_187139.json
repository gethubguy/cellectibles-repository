I'm looking to trade these for portraits that I need.\r\n\r\nMost of these have good eye appeal but got low grades due to back damage. I'm looking for portraits in the same condition (good eye appeal on the front) or will consider trading multiples for something in better condition.\r\n\r\nYou can PM me here or email me at: [url]bayouzach@bellsouth.net[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p212/zguinness/cards/t206group1_zps958304bd.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p212/zguinness/cards/206raw_zps8701e265.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p212/zguinness/cards/206_zps418ee7e5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p212/zguinness/cards/kleinow_zps91614f05.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZach",
