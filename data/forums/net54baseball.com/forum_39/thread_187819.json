This card escapes all criteria for grading with more than a touch of paper loss, but as they say it's guaranteed authentic.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10930/chase-trophy[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTake one bear or the trio.\r\n\r\nPapa is SOLD\r\nMama for $32\r\nBaby Hal is SOLD\r\n\r\nAll prices include shipping.\r\n\r\nPapa's gone.  Baby's gone.  Give Jake a chance.\r\n\r\nBarely listed these bears will not last long.  Papa left in 34 minutes.;)  Now Baby Hal is gone.  One more chance remains.",
