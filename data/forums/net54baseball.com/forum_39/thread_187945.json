      "post_content": "Offered here are several copies of the more difficult Stovall (Portrait) and Turner BROWN SHIRT print variations that I acquired in order to study differences between the CHARCOAL GRAY SHIRT and BROWN SHIRT versions of these two 150/350 subjects.  The difference between the two versions can be easily seen, and is explained, at:\n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=184755[/url]\n\nThe CHARCOAL GRAY SHIRT version of these subjects, which is NOT offered here, is the more common one, and is represented on all copies of these subjects with 150 series backs (as far as I can tell), as well as more than half of the copies with Piedmont 350 and Sweet Cap 350.  The other (less than half) of the copies with Piedmont 350 and Sweet Cap 350, as well as all copies of these subjects with Sovereign 350, have the BROWN SHIRT (again, as far as I know).\n\nI don't think the BROWN SHIRT version is worthy of separate checklisting since it is probably the product of missing blue ink rather than an intentional design change.  It is an interesting print variation nonetheless.  Prices:\n\nStovall (Brown Shirt) PSA 2.5 Piedmont 350 -- ** SOLD **\nTurner (Brown Shirt) PSA 3 Sweet Cap 350/30-- ** SOLD **\nTurner (Brown Shirt) Raw G+ Sovereign 350 -- ** SOLD **\nStovall (Brown Shirt) Raw VG-EX (crease-free) Sweet Cap 350/30 -- $60\nStovall (Brown Shirt) Raw G+ Piedmont 350 -- $30\n\nFirst email to sarpc at qwestoffice dot net gets the card.  I will respond to PMs but emails have priority.  Prices include shipping and insurance.  Paypal gift or personal check, please. Thanks.",
