Paypal gift or money order is fine. Thanks for looking. I would also consider trades for mid tier Hall Of Famers in PSA 3,4 or 5. Examples, Baker, Chance both portraits, Evers Port and Cubs jersey, Tinker Bat on, Port and Hands on knees, Joss Port, Bender Port, Chesbro, Walsh etc etc. No lower tier Hallers ,wanted.",
