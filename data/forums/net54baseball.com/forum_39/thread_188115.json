      "post_content": "I had a few purchases in place two weeks ago that fell through while on vacation.\r\n\r\nI am looking for the following players graded A - 2.5 \r\n\r\n- Walter Johnson\r\n- Christy Mathewson\r\n- Ty Cobb\r\n- Cy Young\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously I am not looking to spend heavily since I am asking for a lower grade card.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you have and what you are looking for, price wise. I would like to buy at least 2 cards over the next three days, but again, it comes down to what dollar values are floating around.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am only looking to add this into my PC. I am not a seller, I do not trade. I simply look for cards that I can afford to place into my collections.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
