      "post_content": "Up for sale is a T206 Vic Willis in Poor condition.  But who cares?  It has the extremely tough Piedmont Factory 42 back!!!  And it's a HOFer!!  The card exhibits noticeable paper loss on front and some creasing.  There is some glue residue on the back that could probably be removed (but I have no experience doing so, so I won't try).\r\n\r\n$XXX (OBO) paypal gift (shipping is on me).  First to PM me or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] with an \"I'll take it\" will be the new owner.\r\n\r\nDon't be shy about making me an offer (if my price is too high).  I'll take the highest one.\r\n\r\nSee scans below for condition.\r\n\r\n[img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T206_Willis.jpg[/IMG][img]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/personal/websize/T206_Willis_back.jpg[/IMG]",
