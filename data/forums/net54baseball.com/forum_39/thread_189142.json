The same POS bottom feeder sent me a PM asking to buy a lot of seven VG3 PSA graded T206 cards for $125...16 hours after I edited the title of my listing to let everyone know a sale was pending for $200. \r\n\r\nWho is this snake and how did they wind up here?\r\n\r\nBest regards and happy collecting. \r\n\r\nEric Perry",
