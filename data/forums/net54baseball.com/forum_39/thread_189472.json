      "post_content": "Hello fellow net54 members.\r\n\r\nI am interested in adding a couple of new pieces to my T206 collection, and felt it could be fruitful to explore options on this forum, as it does attract a lot of die hards, and at the very least, it typically offers pleasant conversation with fellow collectors.\r\n\r\nWhat I covet are Brown Hindu portraits of Cy Young and Walter Johnson. While I realize that these are combinations which no one is likely to want to part with, I have assembled what I believe are interesting trade pieces, and I would love to discuss a potential deal with anyone who may be interested.\r\n\r\nA few of the pieces which can be used to construct a trade, all of which possess a pleasing eye appeal, in my humble opinion:\r\n\r\nLenox\r\n\r\nAl Bridwell \"Portrait- With Cap\" ... PSA 2\r\n\r\n\r\nCAROLINA BRIGHTS\r\n\r\nRoger Bresnahan (HOF) \"Holding Bat\" ... SGC 4.5 and PSA 2\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN HINDU\r\n\r\nRube Waddell (HOF) \"Portrait\" ... SGC 1.5 (formerly PSA 1)\r\nFred Merkle ... SGC 2\r\nFred Clarke (HOF) \"With Bat\" ... SGC A\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN BEAUTY \r\n\r\nHughie Jennings (HOF) \"Both Hands\" {AB 460}\r\nZack Wheat (HOF) {AB 460} ... PSA 3\r\nOrval Overall \"Hands At Face\" {AB 460} ... SGC 1.5\r\nSam Crawford (HOF) \"With Bat\" {AB 350 - No Frame} ... SGC 3\r\nMiller Huggins (HOF) \"Hands At Mouth\" {AB 350 - Framed} ... PSA 3\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PRINCIPE DE GALES\r\n\r\nFrank Bowerman *** F. Scott Fitzgerald Stamp ***\r\nChief Bender (HOF) \"Portrait\" ... SGC 3\r\nHal Chase \"Portrait - Blue\" ... PSA 4\r\nAddie Joss (HOF) \"Hands At Chest\" ... SGC 1\r\nJimmy Collins (HOF) ... SGC 1.5\r\nNap Rucker \"Portrait\" ... PSA 3\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLSTOI\r\n\r\nMiller Huggins (HOF) \"Hands At Mouth\" ... PSA 3\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLE 350\r\n\r\nMatty McIntyre ... SGC 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Common\" Backs\r\n\r\nTris Speaker (HOF) ... SGC 5.5\r\nWillie Keeler (HOF) \"Portrait\" ... SGC 3\r\nHal Chase \"Portrait - Pink\" ... SGC 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above are examples of pieces which can be included, and if some cash is required, this is fine as well. Scans are available upon request, though a select few will not be available for the next few days, as they are currently in transit.\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate your time.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nDerek",
