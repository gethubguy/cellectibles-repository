Perhaps the timing works for you for some trading or some denero.\r\n\r\nLike most of us I prefer to have a clean back, regardless of grade.\r\n\r\nMy \"pipe dream\" is to get a Rucker Throwing BL460 in case anyone knows where to source that one.\r\n\r\nI can offer a lot of rare backs, scrap and other fun cards to trade, so feel free to pm me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nMichael :cool:",
