Please see scans for condition and if you have any questions or need more detail, let me know.\n\nIf you're interested in multiple cards I can work something out with pricing on groups.\n\nRemaining cards:\nShipke Pied $18\nWagner Pied $20\nChance (yellow port) SC PSA1 $55\nMcLean PB PSA1 $28\nChase (blue port) SC PSA1 $22\nThomas SC PSA1(MK) $20\nKleinow Pied PSA1 $25\nKelley Pied SGC10 $50\n\n\nNo longer available: \nBush, Hallman, Cross, Jordan, Sweeney, McIntyre, Chase (pink port), Howard, Powell, Rudolph, Murray, Ritter, Stark, Zimmerman, Camnitz, and McGlynn \n\n\nZach\n[URL=\"bayouzach@bellsouth.net\"]bayouzach@bellsouth.net[/URL]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i61.tinypic.com/amwga8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i62.tinypic.com/j5cttw.jpg[/IMG]",
