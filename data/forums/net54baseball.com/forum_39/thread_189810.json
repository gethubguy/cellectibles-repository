      "post_content": "SOLD.\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI have a T206 portrait of Walter Johnson for sale. The front of the card is exceptional, with bright colors and perfect centering. The back would be perfect if not for a smidge of paper loss over the 'E' in Sweet. There is absolutely no creasing, and the edges look great. SGC deemed the card a SGC40 Very Good. \r\n\r\nSelling for $1,050. I accept check, money order or Paypal. Insurance and priorirty mail shipping are included in price. Open to offers or payment plans.\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/o2WPzy][img]https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2907/14461861494_d085b38095_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/o2WPzy][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3910/14276531267_4ed39c526c_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact me by email or PM.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPeter Baldes\r\n[url]pbaldes@gmail.com[/url]",
