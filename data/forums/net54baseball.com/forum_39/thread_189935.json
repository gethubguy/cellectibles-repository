      "post_content": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI'm toying with the idea of starting a Sovereign 150 subset project.  I want to see how many I can pick up without too much effort, and from there, see if I want to tackle the entire subset.  \r\n\r\nI have commons and HOFers to trade, and I could also purchase.  I'm not too picky on condition.  Most of my trade material is lower grade.\r\n\r\nPlease PM or email me if you have any you might be willing to deal (lukealyon@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
