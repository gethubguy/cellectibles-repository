      "post_content": "Walter Johnson, aka WaJo, aka Big Train, with his hands at chest is ready to be sold.  There is a crease that traverses the card above the ear and eye level.  A second smaller crease drops through the ear and between the nose and mouth exiting at a small notch in the right border.  The reverse is a Sweet Cap 350-460 Fact 42 NC.  Overall this is a very presentable low grade example of this HOFer  \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-raw/10780/johnson-hands[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe card has been sold.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and \"All aboard\"",
