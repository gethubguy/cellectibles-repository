      "post_content": "Hello Everyone, \n\nI have this nicely centered Chick Gandil for sale. No creases, or paper loss. Measures right, 2 5/8 X 1 1/2, but the top edge looks wavy to me and the card may have been trimmed.\n\nStill a very sharp looking card.\n\n$130.00 delivered.\n\nPrefer check or money order. Paypal is also okay.\n\nFirst email with a commitment to purchase gets the card.\n\nThanks for looking,\n\nJoe",
