      "post_content": "Hey guys most of you know \"The T206 Collection the players and their stories\".  Anyways, I finished basically reading the entire book and have to say absolute must read for any collector. Getting all the background history on these players makes you want to collect them so much more. \n\nAnyway, in the book there is a section called \"The Bad Boys of Baseball\". After reading the stories I figured what better way to start collecting the \"Monster\" than with none other than these \"Bad Boys\". I have the list below of all the cards need for this part of the set.  Now this is my third set I am currently working on so it's basically to keep my interest while I wait for some 34 & 38 Goudey's to show up at auctions and such.  \n\nFollowing requirements\n1.Graded by SGC only (what an I say I like uniforminty)\n2.Don't need any hard to get backs\n3.Grade can be no lower than 2. Preferably looking for decent looking cards.\n\nList below of what I need\n\nFrank Bowerman\n\"Sleepy\" Bill Burns\nHal Chase-Blue Background Portrait\nHal Chase-Pink Background Portrait \nHal Chase-Throwing Black Cap\nHal Chase-Throwing White Cap\nHal Chase-Holding Trophy\nEddie Cicotte\nMike Donlin-Fielding\nMike Donlin-Seated\nMike Donlin-With Bat\nJerry Downs\nJean Dubuc\nChick Gandil\nRube Kroh\nDan McGann\nLarry McLean\nGeorge McQuillan-Fielding\nGeorge McQuillan-Batting\nBugs Raymond\nBoss Schmidt-Portrait\nBoss Schmidt-Throwing\nDolly Stark\nHeinie Zimmerman",
