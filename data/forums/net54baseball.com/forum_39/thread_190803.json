      "post_content": "So I don't have any t206s at all and have never really collected them.  I'm looking for a good 50-200 card sized group of them.  Here's the thing though.  I'm an oddity/variation/printing goof sort of collector so I want there to be examples of those in any group I purchase.  Normal cards are fine too but the more ghosts, missing color passes, wrong backs, off-register examples, etc...etc... there are - the better.  Beaters and trimmed cards are fine, I'm just looking for the oddities and don't really care what shape the cards are in.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to getting some replies. Thanks all!\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]",
