First taker gets it. \r\n\r\nMost forms of payment okay. If paypal, pay as friend; thanks.\r\n\r\nI am always looking to upgrade [Good or better], so if you're interested in trading please send me a list of what you have. I prefer ungraded cards.\r\n\r\nNo pm's, please. Email [url]djdoremus@msn.com[/url], or post here. \r\n\r\n*Note on Scans: As the page is turned, the backs are in reverse order. Also, the cards are in two protective plastics, a halved penny-sleeve--which creates the appearance of a vertical line on each card--and a pocket-page:",
