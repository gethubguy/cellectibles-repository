We will not violate that policy so please be patient if we are busy.\r\n\r\nI will be bringing a selection of all Tobacco cards, probably 600+ baseball, all ungraded. I will be selling them at 20% off my prices, and if you buy enough even more off of that. Probably 300to 400 T206s.\r\n\r\nStop by at Booth 305P.\r\n\r\nSteve_NY",

I don't usually say anything if someone does it once ....and then maybe again later. When I looked at your threads started it seemed a bit overzealous to me. There is one section that is for ebay and other auctions.....that would be the only place to really post your national stuff. Had you asked I would have told you....nothing personal and good luck with everything....LL\n\nof course if you are only responding to a question from a member you can still do that....and btw, you should post on the main forum and join in the reindeer games there too....there is always a little more leniency on board matters given to frequent site posters.....if you help the site it can help you....",
