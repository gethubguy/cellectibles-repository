      "post_content": "So glad to have found the forums here. Lots of interesting information. I collected cards in the 80's then sold them all in the late 90's. I was recently at an antique store and found a T206 Stahl. I would like to collect the Boston Red Sox set of T206's. The final 3 I need are the most expensive, Speaker, Cicotte and Kleinow.  I really don't love using eBay and any time I find auctions with more reasonable prices have all ended by the time I discover them. Thanks in advance for any help finding these two. Looking for PSA 1-3.",
