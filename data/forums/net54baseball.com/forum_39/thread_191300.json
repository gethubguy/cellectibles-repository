      "post_content": "Hey, looking to sell these cards, ideally together. The Jack Bliss has outstanding eye appeal, and the corners are excellent, but a little paper loss at the top of its back knocked it to a PSA 2. Initially I bought the Titus because he's the only 'stache in the set, but that sentiment wore off for me...still think it's an excellent card. Both are Piedmont 350, factory 25\r\n\r\nLooking for $60 or best offer, pm if interested.",

I believe there are some unwritten rules when it comes to card collecting/selling...at least I believe there is.\r\n\r\nI know the seller obligated himself by listing this card for a certain price, but I think it was an opportunity to help him out and not take him to the shed on the sale.  I'd say he understands what happened here and won't make the same mistake again...hopefully.",

I've done that before on here for cards that were still for sale at least 4-5 times, but never for something that sold, because then you're interfering in a transaction. As someone pointed out, that's a main rule for the BST.\r\n\r\n Looks like the card was sold within five minutes of it being listed, and since it was listed at 2am EST, I'm not sure how many people you would expect to give him a heads up in under five minutes at a crazy hour?\r\n\r\n  As far as learning his lesson, he did, he still has the card and will get a fair price. That shouldn't change the fact that he's a new board member with no selling track record and shouldn't be allowed to sell after backing out on a deal. I think there should be a good time limit set on when you can START selling on the board, which would give people time to learn things like this and give others a chance to trust them.",
