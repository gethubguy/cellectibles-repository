      "post_content": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI've been having fun buying small groups of T206 and keeping some, selling some, getting some graded, etc.  \r\n\r\nI know a lot of people like to scan each card and sell individually for full retail.  However, if there is anybody out there who doesn't find that enjoyable and would prefer to sell as a group at a small discount without spending much time or energy, please contact me.  We can make it a painless process.  I don't need scans of everything, cell phone pics emailed to me would suffice.\r\n\r\nPM or email me at [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url] if you have anything you'd be willing to sell.  Thanks!",
