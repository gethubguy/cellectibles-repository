Thanks to Thromdog for 6 of the T206's-Zack Wheat is the big card of the lot and it does have a little writing on the bottom front but still pretty nice-I am selling these cards as a lot only-I have about 130.00 in them total and am looking for SOLD delivered-thanks for looking.\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154574&d=1406722346[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154575&d=1406722355[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154576&d=1406722362[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154577&d=1406722370[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154578&d=1406722379[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=154579&d=1406722386[/IMG]",
