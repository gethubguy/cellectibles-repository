Six of my relatives are also related to him and I'd like to get them a card each if possible. If you have a lower grade one you'd like to go to a relative of Dots, let me know your price. Thanks.",

No significant creases.\r\n\r\nIt does have some pencil markings on the back.  If you use your imagination it might say Dots Miller.  From what I can tell it is not an autograph.  I've  seen copies of his autograph and it appears that he signed his name J. D. Miller and with much better handwriting.\r\n\r\nI acquired the card in 1989 at a show in Cedar Rapids, IA.  I traded an '89 Fleer Bill Ripken obscenity card for (6) raw T206 cards.  Values aside, it was a great trade for me.  Vintage for an 80's card...I'll make that trade every day of the week.",

I tried finding it in some old newspapers, but couldn't find an origin. He had the name early in his Pirates career as evidence by this 1909 newspaper headline. I'm still looking for three more, so this is just an educational bump",
