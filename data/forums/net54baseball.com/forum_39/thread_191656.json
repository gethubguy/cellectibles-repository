Here are the portraits that I still need:\n\n\nAmes\nArmbruster\nBender\nBowerman\nBrashear\nBridwell (no cap)\nCarr\nCassidy\nChance (red)\nChesbro\nColes\nCollins, Eddie\nCollins, Jimmy\nCrandall (with cap)\nCriger\nDahlen (Boston)\nDessau\nDoolin\nDoyle\nDurham\nEgan\nElberfield (New York)\n\n\nCONDITION: grade doesn't matter too much to me as long as it's not missing chunks, no paper loss on the front (minimal paper loss on the back is fine).\n\nPrefer SGC graded but I'll take raw, PSA, or SGC.\n\nPlease provide scans/photos and price to: [URL=\"bayouzach@bellsouth.net\"]bayouzach@bellsouth.net[/URL]\n\nThanks,\nZach",
