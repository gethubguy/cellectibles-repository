      "post_content": "The Marquard (hands at thighs) is by far my favorite looking card in the t206 set, but for one reason or another I haven't been able to get my hands on one yet.\r\n\r\nI ran into a couple at the national this week, but I wasnt comfortable enough with any of the prices I saw, so I passed. I'm looking for a lower grade, (PSA 2-3) so let me know if any of you guys have one available. \r\n\r\nThanks!",
