Of the three, I would choose the Evers, and I'll tell you why. It has the least corner wear. It has very nice centering, no indication of trimming, and no really noticeable creases in the middle. That makes for the nicest display of the card's subject. Plus, it has a Polar Bear back, which I would consider an exotic back for somebody that's just started collecting the Monster. There are 39 different backs, and Polar Bear is 30th on the back scarcity list I use. That would make for a pretty nice pickup for your second card. But, of course, choose which one you like most, or pick from somewhere else if you don't like any of those. \r\n\r\nGood luck, and please let us know what you choose. \r\n\r\nBill",
