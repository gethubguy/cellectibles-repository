I've also decided that I want to start collecting the Chicago Cubs subset after the acquisition a Evers and Chance. \r\n\r\nPlease PM me if you have any raw or graded, prefer raw, t206 cards. Particularly Cubs, but I would like to see any that people have for sale. Looking for good to very good condition please :)",
