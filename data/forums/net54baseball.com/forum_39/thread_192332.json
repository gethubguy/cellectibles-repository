Amer\u2013Piedmont\r\nWarhop\u2013Piedmont\r\nWillis/batting\u2013Piedmont\r\n\r\nand a Cobb/green portrait/Piedmont that was in a GAI 30 holder about seven years ago. Would have come from a dealer in the New York area, who also attended shows in Canada. My guess is that card may have been freed from its GAI holder and now resides in something else.\r\n\r\nNot in a position to purchase/trade for any of these now, but just wanted to throw this on the board and see if I could track any of the missing 23.\r\n\r\nThanks to board members who have let me know they are the current owners of 10 others.\r\n\r\nThanks to all for help in my strange quest.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/T206ster/media/Group-shot-of-those-Ive-missed_zps91962d2c.gif.html][IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s81/T206ster/Group-shot-of-those-Ive-missed_zps91962d2c.gif[/IMG][/URL]",

Decided to sell the 200 or so t206s I had at the time to see how many I could find with this guys stamp on the back. \r\n\r\nFast forward to this week, I own 259 of them, plus the missing ones listed in this post. Have over time found he lived in a market/grocery owned by his father and uncle, was about 14 when the cards came out, was drafted in WWI, married, had a child, never left the Gainesville area and died in 1976. His daughter never married, had no children and died about 10 years later. He had moved from this address by 1925, so didn't collect after that point by all appearances. No idea how many cards he had at one time, how they were broken up, or when. But did find a couple pictures of him...\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=171365[/url]\r\n\r\nStill looking for all I can find and reunite.

For one reason, it's likely unique. There are a good deal of T206 collectors, but I'd be surprised if there were somebody else collecting them with this same stamp.\r\n\r\nI also like it because there doesn't seem to be any identifiable pattern to the stamps. It doesn't look like Howe was sticking to any one back or front combination. There are commons, Hall of Famers and Southern Leaguers. There's some variance in the card condition, and a good variety of backs. I love this collection. It's Ed's quest against the rest of the world to find stamps put on tobacco cards over 100 years ago. Just incredible.\r\n\r\nEd, have you ever found duplicates? Or thus far, has every single find been one more piece? Wouldn't it be incredible if this entire set existed with the stamp?",

I've seen photos of them from an individual who had two T206s with the stamp, but don't know what happened to any of those eight cards. I do know the person who had them back in 2009 no longer owns them, but he hasn't been able/doesn't want to share what happened, at least to the T206s I had been interested in.\r\n\r\nDave, thanks for the info. Through a different source than Ancestry.com, I have also found the grave marker for Howe and Thelma, he passing away in 76, and her five years later. I've not been able to find out anything else about Betty, as she doesn't show up on any census info that has been released yet, and there is a record of a death for a Betty McCormack (sp?) in '85 who was also born in 29. Guessing from that, she never married.\r\n\r\nStill lots of blanks in Howe's history. His sister appears to have married before 1930, but passed before 1940. No children listed for her, either. \r\n\r\nJust need to find that long lost, great great great nephew or niece who knows all the answers, and has a couple hundred more of Uncle Howe's cards that they are just willing to give away.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone on the board for their support and help in trying to reassemble the collection.\r\n\r\nEd",
