Lists will not be provided as inventory changes daily.  Many tougher backs available, again be specific in your request.\r\n\r\nThis is not a blow-out nor a clearance, just new inventory that hit at once.  Prices will be market based/fair as always.  If you're looking for a bargain, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEmail only - [url]ppgustafson@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks",
