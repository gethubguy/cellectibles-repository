I'm working on a mid-grade set of each in SGC holders, as well as a second, low-grade raw set of each.  So, if you have something to trade, chances are I need it.\r\n\r\nI can purchase, but I also have some stuff laying around that I can trade.  Photos attached are some trade bait.  I have other nicer cards I could trade, but those would be reserved for nice SGC graded cards I need for my mid-grade set.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have anything via PM.  Thanks for looking!",
