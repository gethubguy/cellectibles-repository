Just a few from my purchase that were a bit odd.\r\n\r\nGriffith Portrait...They really went overboard with the red on this one. The background has very little yellow. He also looks like he is wearing makeup. Red around the lips, cheeks, eyes and ears. Card is clipped but otherwise would be GD-VG. 3 very small light creases. Asking $150.\r\n\r\nDougherty Portrait...Background should be purple but this one is pretty much blue with only the slightest hint of purple specks. Card has no creases and is overall VG-EX. Asking $110\r\n\r\nShad Barry...No name. Or at least only a barely visible very top of a few letters. No creases but card is clipped and someone wrote \"Barry\" in pencil on border of card (which I find amusing as it was necessary because there is no name to be found at the bottom!). Asking $85\r\n\r\nNicholls....Not sure what is going on with this one. Color registration is off and it looks like he has war paint all over his face. Card has 1 inch crease at right and tiny scratch on border by throwing elbow. Overall GD+. Asking $130\r\n\r\nBergen...Double name top and bottom. No creases. Card is EX condition. Asking $100\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains007/OdditiesFront_zps33f60575.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains007/OdditiesBack_zps38185ec8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust for reference...here is what a proper Dougherty and Griffith should look like:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains008/dougherty_zpsf9c5692f.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains009/Griffith_zpsa43a6946.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTom C",
