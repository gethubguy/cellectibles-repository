      "post_content": "When I put together the 250-card T206 Polar Bear subset, this card was the 246th card I acquired, right here on the good old B/S/T in May 2013 for $25. In the ensuing 14 months, I have seen only two other PB Bridwells with cap come up for sale. Though some would call this \"research,\" I will merely submit that this front/back combo doesn't pop up all that often (at least it hasn't in the past three-plus years).\r\n\r\nVery rare for the grade (I've not seen another with a stamp on the front)! Has the corners of a 1.5 or a 2!\r\n\r\nPrice is $xx delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions[/URL].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/bridwell-pb-4-sale.jpg[/IMG]",
