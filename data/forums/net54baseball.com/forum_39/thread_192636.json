But I want to experiment with one or two just to see what sort of time commitment I'd be looking at for all of them. \r\n\r\nIf anyone happens to bust out an encased T206 and doesn't want to keep or have a need for the black gasket/liner/thingy, I'd be interested in getting it to use as a template for all I would have to cut out. Let me know compensation.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nEd",
