I won't say anything more about this guy. But I will post this, and let any prospective buyers decide for themselves. This is from EBay, and it shows how many times he's changed his EBay user ID in the last year and a half. \r\n\r\nThey say a picture is worth 1,000 words. I think this picture speaks volumes.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.com/a/img909/1300/vWwS7M.png[/IMG]",
