Anthony, you'll realize soon enough that there are very rarely any issues when trading or selling on here.  I've done hundreds of sales/trades here and never had anything other than a great transaction.  I think posts warning others about someone who didn't deal in good faith would be good to have here.  But there are dozens of deals done through the b/s/t every day.  We obviously wouldn't want to know that each went off without a hitch (I assume they all do).",

Not every transaction is going to have a thread. If somebody shoots you a message about a card you mentioned you were looking to buy or sell in another thread, for example, there might not be a public record of that transaction. When something like that happens to me, I just add that forum member's name to the list of those I have in my signature. Anybody who sees that will know I had a problem-free transaction, and they can ask for details if need be. \r\n\r\nYou have nothing to worry about. If you ever have a question about something like that, please feel free to send me a pm. I'm always happy to help if I can.",
