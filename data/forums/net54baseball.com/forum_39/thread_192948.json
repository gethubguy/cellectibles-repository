The previous buyer flaked because he was concerned that the card is not graded and might be a fake.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look fake to me; but I'm no expert.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ty-Cobb-T-206-Old-Mill-Tobacco-Card-1909-1911-red-back-portrait-white-border-/121410001408?ViewItem=&ssPageName=ADME%3AX%3ARTQ%3AUS%3A1123&item=121410001408&nma=true&si=f%252FeZWOfNJLD9wh9mgL3o%252FSL3%252BHQ%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!",

What gave me pause was, subsequent to my last email, I noticed that after the eBay selling fee, I would net only $470. Then, at the same time, I got a response from Earl at Sportscard Guaranty in reply to the pictures I sent him, and he said that from what he can see, it may very well be authentic, and since the Old Mill back is rare, if the card is real and it grades numerically, it could sell for $2,000. I'm going to send it to him. The winning bidder blew it. He could have had the card in hand by now.\"",
