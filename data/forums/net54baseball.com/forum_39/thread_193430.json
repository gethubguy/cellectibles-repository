Probably want to start off with SGC/PSA 2's so it doesn't eat up too much of his allowance money :)  --------- If anyone has any other nice condition 2's that aren't Tigers, feel free to offer them up.  I will probably just buy all I can and then distribute them to him as he earns them.\n\nAnd hey Mike Cave ............ I'm back :)",
