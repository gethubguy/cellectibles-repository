Take a look at the scans and decide for yourself.\n\nAsking $SOLD\n\nFirst to PM or e-mail me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] with an \"I'll take it!\" will be the new owner.  Paypal friend/family preferred.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1911%20Young%20T206%20Portrait.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1911%20Young%20T206%20Portrait%20_back_.jpg[/IMG]",
