Does anyone have the following for sale:\n\nNeed all three Jennings\nKilian (throwing)\nMullen (throwing)\nMullen (batting)\nSchafer (fielding)\nSchmidt (throwing)\nStranage\nSummers\nCrawford (throwing)\nCrawford (batting)\n\nMost of mine are raw with creases (cards with character). I do need all 4 Ty Cobb cards but I think I might have to win all 16 weeks of my football pool to get one of these :D  \n\nJim",
