      "post_content": "If you'll check the history of my B/S/T posts, you'll see that I try to price items so that they will sell and sell quickly. More often than not that's what happens.\r\nThough I enjoy watching Pawn Stars, I have no desire to live it. Collectors who rely on VCP and the like will notice that some of the cards below are priced above\r\nthe average and some below. The reason is because I think some of these are strong for the number on the flip and others are weak.\r\n\r\nI promise that I will not be bumping this thread every 36 to 48 hours to announce a 2 percent price reduction. Nor will I bump it to announce whenever a card sells.\r\n\r\nMost of these came from a set put together by a collector who had a pretty good eye. The lower-grade cards especially look nice. Please note that I've posted large\r\nscans that are pretty unforgiving. Just about every card below presents very well in hand.\r\n\r\nAll prices delivered within the United States.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment. Checks, money orders and cash are OK, too.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation.  :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions[/URL].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]\r\n\r\nPiedmonts\r\n\r\nRockenfeld, not slabbed: $95\r\n\r\nPersons, SGC 40/3: $105\r\n\r\nWestlake, PSA 3: $90\r\n\r\nOld Mills\r\n\r\nBastian, SGC 40/3: $105\r\n\r\nBernhard, PSA 4: $195\r\n\r\nCarey, SGC 80/6: $695\r\n\r\nElam, SGC 40/3: $149\r\n\r\nFoster, SGC 60/5: SOLD\r\n\r\nFritz, SGC 20/1.5: SOLD\r\n\r\nGreminger, SGC 60/5: SOLD\r\n\r\nBill Hart, SGC 40/3: $110\r\n\r\nHickman, SGC 60/5: SOLD\r\n\r\nHooker, SGC 30/2: SOLD\r\n\r\nLipe, SGC A: $55\r\n\r\nMcCauley, SGC A: SOLD\r\n\r\nPaige, SGC 40/3: SOLD\r\n\r\nRay Ryan, SGC A: $55\r\n\r\nSeitz, SGC 50/4: SOLD\r\n\r\nCarlos Smith, SGC 60/5: SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/pied-rockenfeld.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/piedmont-persons.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/piedmont-westlake.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-bastian.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-bernhard.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-carey.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-ellam.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-bill-hart.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-lipe.jpg[/IMG]",
