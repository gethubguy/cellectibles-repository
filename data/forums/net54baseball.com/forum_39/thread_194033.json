      "post_content": "This Titus is not going to win many beauty awards but the front is still clean and non like a recent sale is mustache his still intact.  The major impact to the front is in the loss of the upper right corner and a crease through the torso.  The back took the brunt of the damage and has more paper loss than paper still attached.  This paper loss makes the card very thin up near the missing corner and is see through when held up to the light.\r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k607/bn2cardz/bn2cardz/t206Titus001_zps963b4d08.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k607/bn2cardz/bn2cardz/t206Titus002_zps712d2ee4.jpg[/IMG]",
