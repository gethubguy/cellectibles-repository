($55-$60)\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nA higher price point, with more hits? ($65-$75)\r\n\r\nCurrently the lower price point has a hall of fame hit rate of 1:4.5 slots, the higher price point will be roughly the same, but would allow for a Demmitt ST Louis to become a hit among other higher grade (and rarer back) cards, such as a T205 Mathewson, HoF Cracker Jacks, M101 HoFers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration and help.\r\n\r\nSean",

I wanted to do it similar to the 1954 break at around 250 or 300 slots, but if I up the number of slots then I do not need to up the price to put more hits in.\r\n\r\nAny feedback will help, I would essentially pass the 'hit' cost on to the break - so if another $1000 card goes in and it is 250 slots, the slot price would go up by $4 each, but someone has the chance to hit a huge card.\r\n\r\nIt has been mixed so far.",

A PSA 4 Mathewson T205, CJ Walsh, etc. \n\nAny non-t206 cards would specifically be big hits. It was recommended to me by a few board members to try a couple other big hits from other iconic sets.\n\nNothing is set in stone yet.\n\nI actually can't find an O'hara, but do have the Demmitt, so to make up for some of the bigger cards from the set the other hits would be put in.\n\nFor instance I have 2 (or 3) potential copies of a Bat Off Cobb that can be put in, but am lacking green/red port.",
