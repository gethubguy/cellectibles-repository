So, I decided to bring it back.  \r\n\r\nEveryone who has T206 for trade can post in this thread.  Remember to look at the date of each post before contacting the poster to discuss a trade.  If the post is old, keep in mind that they may not have the card(s) anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm just going to post a bunch of pictures of stuff I have to trade.  I also have some graded HOFers that I don't have scans of at the moment.  The big picture at the bottom has a few cards in it that are not available, but most would be for the right item.\r\n\r\n***I have sold/traded almost all of the cards that were pictured in this post as of 11/26/14***",

But as that's unlikely, I'm also continually upgrading my collection, and I'd be interested in many different cards in Good or better condition, particularly hall-of-famers.\n\nI also have 70-80 variously graded [from 1-5] cards, so if you have anything I like I may be able to accommodate you beyond what I've posted.  I prefer ungraded cards and am also in the process of replacing my slabbed ones.\n\nLuke Lyons, if you still have that Merkle portrait, I'd like to trade for it.  In any event, let me know what you still have available.\n\nOf course, I hope to hear from you other traders out there as well.  Bump this thread, or email [url]djdoremus@msn.com[/url].  You can pm me, too, but I prefer email.\n\nI should add that the first to say he'll take a card [via trade or sale] gets it.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nDoug\n\nUpdate: Kelley, Willis, batting, Chase, Stone, both Mannings, and Wiltse have been traded. \nAtz, Groom, Phelps have been sold, as have Maddox, Bridwell, McGann, Jackson, Conroy, Tannehill, Nicholls, Lindaman, Pfeister, Chase (top middle), and Frill. \n\nList of remaining cards:\n\nPage 1:\n\nUnglaub,\nGanzel,\nEVERS,\nG.

Raw or graded are both fine.  Also looking for portraits from the 150/350 series with Sov150, EPDG, and Old Mill backs.
