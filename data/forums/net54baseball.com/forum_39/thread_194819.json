If you want graded cards nicer than 1's and 2's, this lot is not for you.\r\n\r\n(70) cards in total, all with various Sweet Caporal backs.  All cards guaranteed Authentic.  Also included is a great T206 themed set binder in like-new condition.  I will also throw in (25) additional fifteen pocket plastic sheets to fill up as you add to your set.\r\n\r\n$1,500 Dlvd.
