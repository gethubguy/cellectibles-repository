      "post_content": ":eek:\r\n\r\nThis card will be delivered dry without chemical fire retardants.\r\n\r\nYou can control this Wildfire yourself with your purchase of a very decent \"raw\" copy of Mr. Schulte (in the full monty front pose) with the Piedmont 150 back.\r\n.\r\nThere is a slight wrinkle left of the right ear, but no creasing.  The right lower corner displays a bit of fraying, but rounding of the corners is uniform. Centering is excellent.  The edges are fine.  A solid VG in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThis card will be shipped to your collection for $40 ($41 for regular paypal).\r\n\r\nAn offer might be considered in you favor.  You never know.:confused:",
