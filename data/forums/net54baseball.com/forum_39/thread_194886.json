      "post_content": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nLooking to move this WaJo to a new home.  Examples with a front this nice don't seem to come to market very often.  I have had this one for close to 5 years.  The front has a couple wrinkles that can only be seen when you tilt the card to the perfect angle in the right light.  So, not perfect, but pretty damn close.\r\n\r\n$600 obo\r\n\r\nShipping is on me.  Please let me know if you'd also like insurance (I will charge you the exact amount).\r\n\r\nIf you claim it for the full $600, it is yours. \r\n\r\nI will accept offers until tomorrow morning, and then take the best one tomorrow.  Thanks for looking!",
