Please note that I've posted extra-large\r\nscans that are pretty unforgiving. Just about every card below presents very well in hand -- they all look better in hand than in the huge scans.\r\n\r\nPiedmonts\r\n\r\nPersons, SGC 40/3: $94\r\n\r\nRockenfeld, SGC 35/2.5: SOLD\r\n\r\nWestlake, PSA 3: SOLD\r\n\r\nOld Mills\r\n\r\nBastian, SGC 40/3: SOLD\r\n\r\nBastian, PSA 4: SOLD\r\n\r\nBernhard, PSA 4: $189\r\n\r\nCarey, SGC 60/5: $349\r\n\r\nElam, SGC 40/3: $139\r\n\r\nBill Hart, SGC 40/3: $94\r\n\r\nLipe, SGC 20/1.5: $53\r\n\r\nRay Ryan, SGC A: $44\r\n\r\nAlso willing to trade for mid-grade Piedmont SLers I need.\r\n\r\nPlease add $4 shipping no matter how many cards you buy. Shipping within United States only.\r\n\r\nPayPal is fine. No need to \"gift\" your payment. Checks, money orders and cash are OK, too.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation.  :rolleyes:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions[/URL].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/piedmont-persons.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-bernhard.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/OM-carey-60.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-ellam.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-bill-hart.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-lipe20.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/om-ray-ryan.jpg[/IMG]",
