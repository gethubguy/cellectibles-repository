      "post_content": "[quote name=\"bnorth\" post=1330887]Sean wouldn't this be much better to have it's own section like the auctions you and Greg tried?\r\n\r\nThe net54 group break sold out in 14 hours and 3 weeks later is still getting bumped. In 14 hours you have sold less than 25 of 456 spots. I do not think this is fair to people trying to buy/sell/trade in this section for you to have this thread that could last for months.\r\n\r\nEDIT was to change the length of time to what it really was, my mistake. Sean PMed me saying he had contacted Leon and offered to pay for his own thread so I guess this is the proper place for it. Good luck to all participating in the break.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTo be clear Sean (hi Sean) is not paying for this thread. He offered to pay for one on the front page and I said I didn't want one there except for the one's Nick does. We agreed he would do one here but there is no Net54baseball cost to him for doing it. Sean has my support in doing it as it seems a lot of members like these.\r\n Just like everything we do we will re-evaluate what we have done after it's over. I do see an issue with the number of bumps to this particular thread relative to the other guys trying to sell or trade a card or two in other threads.",

I think you have missed on the items below:\r\n\r\n80% of the cards are below a \"2\" grade or lower.  I think a $65 price point is to high.\r\n\r\nAt this price, 456 slots is going to be tough to sell out.\r\n\r\nThe 54 Topps sold out in 14 hours mainly because most people felt like the odds vs the price point was good.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I applaud your effort and idea.  You just may want to re-think the cost.\r\n\r\nMark",

For instance accounting for shipping on 100 packages turns the approx profit into $100~ after supplies and negative after labor.\r\n\r\nWhat it boils down to is that I could put together 5 or 6 100 slot breaks and I tried to go too big too fast.
