      "post_content": "I am starting to pursue this collection a little more now. Like quite a few others here, I like the T206 cards, but don't necessarily want to tackle \"The Monster\". So I am going after this \"mini-monster\", an Indianapolis master team set. Collecting the Carolina Brights, Broad Leaf 350, and Drum 350 backs will be extremely difficult, if not next to impossible so I might not try for those, but you never know.\n\nI am wanting cards in the Poor - Good range. Mostly looking for raw, but wouldn't pass up graded cards (from SGC, PSA, or BVG only) either.\n\nBelow is the list of cards, sorted by player with their confirmed backs. The backs are then sorted by rarity (easiest to most difficult ... according to T206Resource.com). Cards I own have been crossed out.\n\nPlease email or PM the cards you have along with offer.\n\n\nBurke, Jimmy\n  *  [STRIKE]Piedmont 350[/STRIKE]\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25\n  *  [STRIKE]Sovereign 350 (Forest Green)[/STRIKE]\n  *  Polar Bear\n  *  [STRIKE]Old Mill[/STRIKE]\n  *  Cycle 350\n  *  [STRIKE]American Beauty 350 (with frame)[/STRIKE]\n  *  El Principe De Gales (EPDG)\n  *  Carolina Brights\n  *  Broad Leaf 350\n  *  Drum 350\n\n\n\nCarr, Charley\n  *  [STRIKE]Piedmont 350[/STRIKE]\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25\n  *  Sovereign 350 (Forest Green)\n  *  Polar Bear\n  *  Cycle 350\n  *  American Beauty 350 (with frame)\n  *  Carolina Brights\n  *  Drum 350\n\n\n\nCross, Monte\n  *  [STRIKE]Piedmont 350[/STRIKE]\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25\n  *  Tolstoi\n\n\n\nDavidson, Paul\n  *  [STRIKE]Piedmont 350[/STRIKE]\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25\n  *  [STRIKE]Polar Bear[/STRIKE]\n  *  Cycle 350\n  *  American Beauty 350 (with frame)\n  *  El Principe De Gales (EPDG)\n  *  Tolstoi\n  *  Carolina Brights\n  *  Broad Leaf 350\n  *  Drum 350\n\n\n\nHayden, Jack\n  *  [STRIKE]Piedmont 350[/STRIKE]\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 30\n  *  Sweet Caporal 350 Fact. 25\n  *  Polar Bear\n  *  Cycle 350\n  *  American Beauty 350 (with frame)\n  *  [STRIKE]Tolstoi[/STRIKE]\n  *  Broad Leaf 350\n\n\n\nThanks.",

The only thing i dislikeis I havent seen any that are colorful or cool backgrounds. mainly just plain color red or green. Alot of portraits too instead of action shots but still cool since its Indiana based.\r\n\r\nGood luck and I cant wait to see what you put together!",
