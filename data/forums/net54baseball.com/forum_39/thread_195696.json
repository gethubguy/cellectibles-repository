Any no fee method is fine.  \n\nThe reason the Cobb isn't graded is that I have had it for about 4 years, and never considered parting with it until recently.  I liked having it raw.  I have made a bunch of purchases lately, and need to sell some things and haven't had time to plan ahead about selling the Cobb.  \nFor full disclosure, I bought it here 4 years ago from a reputable seller with no mention of any qualifiers.  However, I think there is a small chance it has been trimmed.  I'd bet against it, but I never want to deceive anyone so I'm mentioning the possibility.  It has a diamond cut, so that may be what I'm seeing.  Take a look and judge for yourself.\n\nCobb (crease-free, diamond cut) $700 obo\nLajoie SGC 40 $300\nWalsh PSA 3mk $125\nDoc White Hindu SGC 10 $165",
