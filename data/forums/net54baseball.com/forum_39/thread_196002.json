      "post_content": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently came across a large lot of Old Mill Cigarettes T206-related ads.  These were all taken from the Savannah Morning News during the spring of 1910.\r\n\r\nI have 19 different scenes.  Each measure approximately 5 x 7.  Each shows a \"southern scene\" of one sort or another along with a box of Old Mill Cigarettes with 2 T206s and an Old Mill coupon coming out of the top.  Each also notes \"Baseball pictures and a valuable coupon in each package.\"\r\n\r\nOf the various scenes, some might be considered a bit racially charged.\r\n\r\nScans of each are shown below.  I am asking $30 each for these.  \r\n\r\nThank you.  Please PM me (and add an email address if you want a scan) or email me directly at [url]mackeyd@mailcity.com[/url]\r\n\r\nHappy Collecting,\r\nCraig",
