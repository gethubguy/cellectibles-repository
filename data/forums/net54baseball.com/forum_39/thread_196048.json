      "post_content": "I have these two cards for sale and both look much better than the grade. The Chance is knocked down because it has some paper loss and addition on the back, but doesn't affect the writing too much. The front is a beauty, something you would see on a much higher grade card. Cobb is also much nicer than your normal 2/30. I'm guessing the soft corners and spot next to his name knocked it down(I made the scan a little darker so you can see the spot, back isn't as bright red as scan looks, but wasn't as dull as the first picture I put up). See the scans, judge for yourself on the grades, they are nice cards. I brightened the back scan a little so you can see the paper loss next to \"BALL\". The red line going down the Cobb back is from the scanner.\r\n\r\nChance $125\r\nCobb $850\r\n\r\nPrices include shipping. Would do $900 for both",
