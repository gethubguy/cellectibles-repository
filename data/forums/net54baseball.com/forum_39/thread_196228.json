I offered him my Old Mill (shown below), but he prefers one with a Piedmont back. Figured I'd give it a shot to see whether anyone wants to trade a comparable Piedmont Bill Hart for mine. If yours is nicer, I'll kick in some cash to even things. If yours is a grade or two lower but presents nicely, that's fine. (The back of mine is problem free.)\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Email me[/URL] if you'd like to work out something.\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]",
