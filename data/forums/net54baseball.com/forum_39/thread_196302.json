      "post_content": "Greetings fellow net54 enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nI am currently very keen to acquire an example of the Walter Johnson \"Portrait\" with an El Principe De Gales advertising reverse.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in the technical grade so much as an example which is pleasing to the eye. The only thing which I would not have interest in discussing would be a \"beater\", and it is likely that a highly graded piece would be far too good for the likes of me.\r\n\r\nCash is a possibility, but I am also very interested in discussing trade, as I have an assortment of pieces available, including several Hall of Fame subject and advertising reverses including Lenox, Hindu, and American Beauty.\r\n\r\nIf you feel you may have a match and wish to discuss a possible deal, please feel free to PM me and I can present you with a trade list.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\nDerek",
