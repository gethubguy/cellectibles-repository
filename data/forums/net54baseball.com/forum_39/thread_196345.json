      "post_content": "Hey guys,\n\nI got home from setting up at a show for the weekend, and I'm still in the selling mood.  They are all individually priced.  I priced them all to have a little room for negotiation.  Some have only a tiny bit of room, while others have a little more.  Feel free to shoot me an offer.  PM is fine, email also works.  [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url]   I'm not looking to give them away, as they can just go into my ebay store if they don't sell.  But I would definitely prefer to move them.\n\nShipping is $3\n\nI've got a pretty busy morning, so it might take me awhile to get back to you.  I'll answer all emails and PMs in the order received, and obviously a commitment to buy takes precedence over any negotiation or pending offer.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nEdit:  Please let me know if you'd like to see a better scan of any of these.  They came out smaller than I had intended.\n\nStill Available:\nBastian P350\nRockenfeld\nMolesworth\nHoward\nCranston\nMiller\nPerdue\nOrth SGC 35\nMcCauley SGC A\n\nThese cards are sold:\nHelm\nPaige\nJordan\nRevelle \nColes\nLentz\nFritz\nRyan\nSmith\nLipe\nHart\nKing\nGreminger\nOtey\nMullaney\nKiernan\nMcCauley\nBastian OM",
