They are all individually priced. I priced them all to have a little room for negotiation. Some have only a tiny bit of room, while others have a little more. Feel free to shoot me an offer. PM is fine, email also works. [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url] I'm not looking to give them away, as they can just go into my ebay store if they don't sell. But I would definitely prefer to move them.  Please let me know if you'd like additional/better scans or pics of any of these cards.\n\nShipping is $3\n\nI'll answer all emails and PMs in the order received, and obviously a commitment to buy takes precedence over any negotiation or pending offer.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nThese cards have been sold:\nJoss\nTinker hands on knees\nJennings 2 hands showing PB $59\nOverall Tolstoi\nMerkle OM\nKrause epdg\nMaloney cycle\nCassidy AB\nRaymond AB\nKelley William Born 11/6",
