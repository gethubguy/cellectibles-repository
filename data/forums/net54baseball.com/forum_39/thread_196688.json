      "post_content": "I'm not totally sure how rare this print variation is, but it is the only one I have seen.  \r\n\r\nIt's also a bit of a print oddity with the registration on the left side and bottom making it look like there are two borders.  Also, a speck of blue to the right of his face in the background, and blue on top and the left due to the registration.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it is an SGC 55 makes it kind of stick out in my collection, so I'm thinking of trading it.  I'm mainly interested in 150 series cards.  Nice GD/VG or VG+ Sov150s, a beat up Hindu, or a few nice 150 series portraits could do it.  I'm sure there are other things I would be interested as well.  Just let me know if you have interest and we can go from there.",
