I can't locate your email address in my contacts list either, so I'm just replying here instead.\n\nDid I sell you that Rube a few years back? I seem to remember it, but I'm not positive.\n\nAnyway, I have a passing interest and I was wondering what you're looking to get for it. Please drop me a line at your convenience -- email link is in my signature.\n\nIf you happen to have the latest Standard Catalog, it should be listed in there as well. I'm curious what it lists at for VG.\n\nThank you,\n-Trae",
