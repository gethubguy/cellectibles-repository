      "post_content": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nThese Mattys are a little too rough for my condition requirements, so I'm looking to trade them for an equivalent value of cards that fit my collection a little better.  I also have a Sov150 Rucker available.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for:\r\n-crease-free (or almost crease-free) HOFers with common backs\r\n-HOFers with tougher backs (condition not as important)\r\n-mainly looking for the mid-tier HOFers like McGraw, Evers, Tinker, Brown, Baker, Crawford, Chance, Collins, Keeler.  But would also be interested in others potentially.  Also would love to trade both for a decent Cy Young if that possibility is out there.\r\n-Also looking for 150/350 series players with Old Mill backs\r\n-For Rucker, hoping to find an Old Mill or Sov150 back of a similarly tough player\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want to talk trade, or have any questions.  PM is fine, or email at [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url]",
