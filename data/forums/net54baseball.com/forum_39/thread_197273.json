      "post_content": "I am taking offers on my back run of Frank Arellanes cards. I have spent many years on this run and many of the cards are high grade when considering tougher backs. The run consists of 9 cards. American Beauty, Broadleaf, Carolina Brights, Cycle, Piedmont, Polar Bear, 2 Sweet Caps amd Tolstoi. It needs Drum and Blank back to be complete. Both are confirmed but have not come up for sale.\n \nThis is not a fire sale and I would like to see an advanced t206 collector complete it but realize that may not be possible. I will consider breaking it up later but wanted to try this first. Email is the best way for me to communicate. [url]stevenwsadler@aol.com[/url] \n                                         Steve",
