I am looking for something with decent eye appeal, slabbed in an SGC or PSA holder in the 1.5-3.5 range depending on price, appeal, etc.\r\n\r\nI have done a lot of searching on Ebay and will default to an auction if I need to - I just wanted to put something out there for the N54 crew if someone has one that they have upgraded and are looking to get rid of.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nKevin",
