Who looks at the back anyway?:rolleyes:\n\nFeast your eyes on the scan and then decide for yourself about this addition to your collection.  It was available today and is now SOLD.  If you don't say \"I'll take it\", your famine will continue.;)\n\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10291/pfeister-throwing[/IMG]",
