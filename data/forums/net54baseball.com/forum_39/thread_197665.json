Add $3 for regular PayPal.  \n\nMy last listing in this section lasted 11 minutes, so don't let this one get away.;)\n\nIf, for some reason, your keyboard is shorter than mine, do not despair for common ground may exist.  Feel free to let me know via PM how long your keyboard is.\n\nWhat are Frank Bucks? If you have purchased from me in the past on BST, you already have Frank Bucks. With every future purchase you will receive Frank Bucks at the rate of 2.5% (better than Ebay). They may be used to defray up to 10% of the cost of future purchases if you accept my asking price without haggling. If you want to know how many Frank Bucks you already have, just shoot me a PM. Frank Bucks expire when I do and have no cash value.",

Well I can assure you that there is no brown crap on the edge of the slab.:D\nIt is a reflection from my brown wood paneled ceiling which occurs when I scan with the lid up at night when the ceiling lights are on.  I bet you are all relieved.\n\nI will add another scan this morning without the brown crap this morning in the original post, but it will not be done with my CCD scanner so the card image with not be as good.  It's an imperfect world, but I don't sell brown crap.:eek:",
