      "post_content": "Here's a pair of \"Collector Grade\" T206's with really nice looking fronts and some problems with the backs.\r\n\r\n$OLD T206 Willie Keeler Portrait HOFer w/ EPDG back - SGC10 - back damage from being removed from an album, but also with a very interesting dark black stamp that I have been thus far been unable to identify. Front presents extremely well. A nice chance to pick up a hall of famer with an uncommon back at a cheap price!\r\n\r\n$OLD T206 Foley White - Houston - Southern Leaguer SGC 10 - really strong front with a nickle sized spot of back damage on the Piedmont 350 reverse. \r\n\r\nTwo great looking cards to add to your collection at a fraction of the cost without the back damage.\r\n\r\nShipping is included. Please PM if interested. \"I'll take it\" trumps any ongoing negotiations. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking,\r\n\r\nSteve",
