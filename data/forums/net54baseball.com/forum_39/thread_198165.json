I sent my \"I'll take it\" PM at the same time you updated your original post to \"red portrait\" (11:42), so I know I was the first to claim it.  I haven't received a reply yet though.\r\n\r\nSorry to bug you if you're just busy at work or something.  I was just really excited to get this one for my back run (already have the Hindu, so this and the EPDG are the next tough ones to find) and I'm starting to worry after two hours.\r\n\r\nLuke",
