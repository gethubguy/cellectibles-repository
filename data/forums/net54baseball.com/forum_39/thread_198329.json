Add a buck for reg PP.\r\n\r\nFrank Bucks will be applied to this purchase.\r\n\r\nWhat are Frank Bucks? If you have purchased from me in the past on BST, you already have Frank Bucks. With every future purchase you will receive Frank Bucks at the rate of 2.5% (better than Ebay). They may be used to defray up to 10% of the cost of future purchases if you accept my asking price without haggling. If you want to know how many Frank Bucks you already have, just shoot me a PM. Frank Bucks expire when I do and have no cash value.",
