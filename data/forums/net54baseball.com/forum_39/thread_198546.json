      "post_content": "Despite the qualifier, this card presents very nicely. Strong corners, beautiful color and registration, partial name at top.  Spotless and centered SCap 150 fact. 30 back. A straight PSA 8 recently sold for close to $200,000, and a PSA 7 sold for $75,000. Also, a PSA 5.5 just sold for $27,500 at Heritage, and a PSA 4 for $17,200 at Goldin last week.  There are no higher grades than a PSA 8 of this card (no 9's). This is a very strong card, great value compared to a straight PSA 7 or 8...Asking $40K, thanks for looking...I would consider a cash/trade deal...",
