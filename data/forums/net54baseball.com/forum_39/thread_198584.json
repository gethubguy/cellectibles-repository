      "post_content": "I've bought 4 via straight sales from members, and won 4 auctions in the last few months.  Also acquired 2 via trade.  So I think I am paying very fair prices.  \r\n\r\nI am mainly looking for lower grade, presentable examples, but would consider mid-grades.  I have 2 low grade Hindu HOFers to trade as well as many other HOFers.  And of course, I can purchase.  I may not be able to afford the top 3 on my list at the moment (depending on grade), but would still love to see what's out there.  \r\n\r\nHere is my want list:\r\n\r\nJohnson Portrait (R) (HOF)\r\nYoung Portrait (HOF)\r\nMathewson Portrait (HOF)\r\nLajoie Portrait (HOF)\r\nWalsh (HOF)\r\nTinker Portrait (HOF)\r\nBrown Portrait (HOF)\r\nJoss Portrait (HOF)\r\nEvers Portrait (HOF)\r\nMcGraw Portrait, No Cap (HOF)\r\nGriffith Portrait (HOF)\r\nBresnahan Portrait (HOF)\r\nLajoie Throwing (HOF)\r\nMathewson White Cap (HOF)\r\nTinker Hands on Knees (HOF)\r\nMarquard Hands at Side (R) (HOF)\r\nBrown Cubs (HOF)\r\nEvers Cubs (blue sky) (HOF)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
