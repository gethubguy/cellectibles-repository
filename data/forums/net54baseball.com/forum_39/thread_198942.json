      "post_content": "One of the toughest cards to find in high grade (Only 16- PSA 6's, 6- PSA 7's and 1- PSA 8 of all backs), and this is also an extremely tough back to boot. Only 3 Cycles of all grades according to PSA Pops, next highest is a PSA 4.  The last PSA 7 of this card with a common back sold for $1465. Spotless back, corners are razor sharp, don't know why this did not at least grade a 7.5, $3500 delivered with insurance...thanks **No longer available**",
