      "post_content": "This card looks like a 10, I can't find any flaws. Spotless Pied 150 back, perfect centering, razor sharp corners. According to PSA Pops., there are only 5 PSA 7's, and 4 PSA 8's off all backs, none higher...A PSA 8 with a Sovereign 150 back sold for $6,340 at Goodwin in 2010. Looking for offers, or would entertain T206 trade & cash proposals, thanks....",

Especially if you don't own them.  It is unethical and dishonest.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTo all members\r\nThere shouldn't be any discussing of past prices in the BST. If someone is doing something wrong, post a thread on the front page. If someone is committing fraud, as selling something they in fact don't own (to me that is fraud), then it can be mentioned here to protect others. But if you do that you really better have your ducks in a row. thanks",
