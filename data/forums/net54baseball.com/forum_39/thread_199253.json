      "post_content": "I still have the Birmingham SGC 20 and Abbott PSA 5 (mk) for sale.  Asking $25.00 for the Birmingham and $45 for Abbott plus $2 to ship.  The Abbott is a really nice card only has two small pencil marks on back to get the mk mark.  Might be worth breaking out and sending to SGC since they don't give those designations. Certain those would erase right off.\r\n\r\nPhotos attached, paypal f/f preferred.\r\n\r\nThanks!!",
