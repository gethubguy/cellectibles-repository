Just want to make it clear that I'm not simply trying to flip it (not that there's anything wrong with that) but rather have an opportunity to pick up a pretty nice Wagner but need to come up with the funds by the end of the month. \r\n\r\nI have quite a few cards up for sale at the moment in various B/S/T threads and have already sold a 1951 Bowman Mantle RC in an attempt to come up with the funds necessary. If anyone would like to make an offer on this card, or any of my currently listed cards, please feel free.",
