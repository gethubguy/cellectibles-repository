      "post_content": "In my opinion this card presents much nicer than the technical grade.  There is a corner wrinkle on the top right that is very hard to see without looking at a scan or holding the card up to the light.  The back looks flawless in person, but in the scan you can see a slight scratch or something above the 'I\" in Hindu.\r\n\r\nA copy of this card in a SGC 30 holder just went for $345 in Sterling.  It is also a nice card, but mine is pretty far superior in my opinion, as mine is crease-free and has better centering.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.sterlingsportsauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=28292&searchby=0&searchvalue=None&page=0&sortby=0&displayby=2&lotsperpage=50&category=9&seo=1909-1911-T206-Overall%2c-Portrait%2c-Hindu-Cigarettes-SGC-30[/url]\r\n\r\nI'm asking $545 obo\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
