      "post_content": "The \"Curveless Wonder\" Al Orth, a Southern Leagues card, is up for grabs.  He won 204 major league games though without a curve and without a fast ball.  His pitch was described as a \"glistening ball... but little speed, and scarce a curve at all.\" ;)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/23473/orth-sl[/IMG]\r\n\r\nand Fred Payne as well, never a star, never a regular, with one career home run to his credit.  Look at the size of that left thumb, reputed to be the largest thumb in the T206 set.  Fred is buried in Mexico.  I have no information about where the thumb is buried.:eek:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10288/payne[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLet's start with Orth at $69 and Payne at $38.  Shipping included or take them both for $107.  A small surcharge for regular Paypal.  Any no fee payment method accepted.",
