It's a nice looking card and is guaranteed original and unaltered (hasn't been trimmed, touched up etc).  My guess is it is a 2/2.5 (maybe a 3 with the right grader).  Asking SOLD but would consider offers and possibly trades for a similar condition Tolstoi, Cycle, EPDG common or maybe others.  Let's talk!",
