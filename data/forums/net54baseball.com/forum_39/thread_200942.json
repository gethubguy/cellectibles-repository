I appreciate all of the generous deals you, and so many of you on the Net54 have given me.  \r\nWhat started as a journey to collect one of each player in the set has, of course, turned into a quest to complete a set of 520.  I haven't decided on how to display my cards but I will be sure to share photos when I do.  Maybe I'll have to post a few scans of the worst of the worst.\r\nThanks again,\r\nJon",

Most just happen to be the worst!  \r\n\r\nIf you do have a card you'd like to upgrade to a little less horrible looking one, I will definitely take a look.",
