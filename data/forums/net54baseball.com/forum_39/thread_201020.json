      "post_content": "T206 Old Mill Willie Keeler PSA 1 (graded before half grades were issued).  Very tough front/back combo of a Yankee HOFer.  Looks much nicer than a 1.  Sharp colors on this one with some normal rounded corners and light to moderate crease (middle of card).  No longer for sale (sending out to be re-graded).\n\n[IMG]http://i61.tinypic.com/smu0pg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i61.tinypic.com/oqwq4m.jpg[/IMG]",
