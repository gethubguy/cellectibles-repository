Well it was only half of another card... not sure why someone would re-back a 150 with a 150...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not even going to try and take a shot at guessing what this might grade specifically (but likely low, per the back issues), but it presents well.\r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\nPay however you like.\r\nEmails have priority: [url]trae@t206.org[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
