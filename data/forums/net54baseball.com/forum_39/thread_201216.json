      "post_content": "I've had many posts in the last mouth, and tried never to be a \"BST hog\" keeping only two, maybe three, on first page.  Now that I've fallen off page 1, I figured I'd post the remaining 200+ cards I have.  They are all on ebay (sg713), which is convenient for viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/sch/sg713/m.html?item=141493342621&ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2562[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, they have \"ebay prices\" attached to them.\r\n\r\nIf interested, please contact me at [url]mybuddyinc@yaoo.com[/url] for \"net54 prices.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, now that I've gotten your attention (and please don't bad mouth* me for doing so).  For those who don't follow The Trading Post, any help on the following would be greatly appreciated (everything on ebay is available for trade):\r\n\r\nHere is my want list:\r\n\r\nHOF (f/g):\r\n\r\nNeed, for upgrade:\r\n\r\nCobb, bat off\r\nJohnson, portrait\r\nYoung, port.\r\n\r\nYoung, glove shows -- I have a Polar Bear example, but would love to trade it for an equally conditioned Piedmont or Sweet Caporal (scan attached)\r\n\r\nSL (g/vg):\r\n\r\nBreitenstein\r\nFoster\r\nShag\r\n\r\nI have 5 attached SL scans (Thornton is not available).  I would trade straight up any for Breitenstein or Foster.  \r\nHowever, I would trade any two for a single Shag in equal or better condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon, Piedmont or Sweet Caporal only (g/vg):\r\n\r\nDurham\r\n\r\n\r\n:eek::\r\n\r\nDemmitt, StL (p)\r\n\r\nAs always, O'Hara for trade.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=177823&d=1423075104[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=177824&d=1423075205[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=178173&d=1423324433[/IMG]",
