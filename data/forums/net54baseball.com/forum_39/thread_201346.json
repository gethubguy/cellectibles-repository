I argued and argued and argued.  They were adamant.\r\n\r\nSo it comes back with 'both ears' ?!?  How could that be valid, when both ears show on BOTH portraits?  They used the T205 descriptor.  Morons, but the best in the business :(",

As far as ink shifts go, most are aesthetically unappealing.  This one is weird and aesthetic.  But I completely understand your logic, and it makes complete sense.\r\n\r\nIt is probably only aesthetic to a non-scrap collector, and way too normal (looking) for scrap collectors.\r\n\r\nI need to add one more thing: :o I honestly never noticed the flip error until you guys mentioned it in this thread.  Is that weird, or what?  Every time I look at the card I get enraged remembering them refusing to put 'ghost image' on it, so I have never thought beyond that.   Now that you have pointed it out, I kinda like it :)",
