      "post_content": "Obviously not a part of my Polar Bear subset (not on it), but I'm on the lookout for a Merkle Portrait. Back doesn't matter, but I'd like something of an example to at least look at. There's a Hindu on eBay that's enticing, but I'm sure I can get better than an Authentic on a different back for less than $250.\r\n\r\nThanks. I guess the monster is alive. I've made multiple purchases off of Net54 this week :D",
