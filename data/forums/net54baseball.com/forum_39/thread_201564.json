      "post_content": "I picked this up last month, but would like to trade it for T206 in G/VG condition.  Looking for cards w/o heavy creases (minor wrinkles are ok), but rounded corners are ok.  Let me know what you have for trade.  \r\n\r\nThe card was graded a SGC 20 (1.5) due to the stamp, but otherwise looks Ex/Mt - no other hidden issues.  I cracked it out of the SGC holder so it is now RAW.  I will include the flip if we're able to work out a trade.",
