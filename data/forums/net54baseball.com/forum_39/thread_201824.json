I have not priced the Ganley or the Tenney, for I wish to upgrade them. \n\nDoyle (trimmed): sold\nMcQuillian (no name): sold\nBergen (Polar bear): sold\nSharpe: sold\nLake (possibly trimmed):sold\n\nI am always looking for possible trades. I collect Polar Bear backs that I don't have, hall of famers, and southern leaguers. \n\nThanks,\nWazoo",
