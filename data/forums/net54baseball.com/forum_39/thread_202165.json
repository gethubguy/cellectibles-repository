      "post_content": "I'm looking to round out my first series HOF collection with some Old Mills (also looking for Hindus, but didn't want to clutter this thread up too much).  I can purchase or trade.  Please let me know via PM or email (lukealyon@gmail.com) if you have any of these available.  I bet we can work something out.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nNote:  Most of these are not for sale, and there are a couple I don't really want to trade.  The Cy Young is only available if I am getting an Old Mill Cy Young (or maybe a Matty portrait) in return.\n\n\nLooking for these Old Mills:\n\nBender portrait\nBresnahan portrait\nBrown Cubs on shirt\nChesbro\nCrawford throwing\nClarke portrait\nClarke batting\nDavis\nEvers portrait\nFlick\nGriffith portrait\nJennings portrait\nJoss portrait\nKeeler portrait\nKeeler batting\nLajoie portrait\nLajoie throwing\nMarquard hands at sides\nMatty portrait\nMatty white cap\nMcGraw portrait no cap\nMcGraw finger in air\nTinker portrait\nTinker hands on knees\nWaddell throwing\nWallace\nWalsh\nWillis portrait\nYoung portrait\nYoung bare hand",
