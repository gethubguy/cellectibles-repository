Then click on the \"Auction Sites\" link and the page will list several different auction site options.  \r\n\r\nClick on \"Sterling Sports Auctions\" and you will be taken to their web site.  You will have to register (its free) before being able to bid on any of the items in the auction.  The auction is ran by a Net54 member (Lee). \r\n\r\nHope that this helps!",
