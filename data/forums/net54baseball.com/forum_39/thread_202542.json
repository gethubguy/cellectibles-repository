Graded SGC 55. There are only 2 cards that have been graded higher I think, 1 SGC 60 and 1 PSA 5.\r\n\r\nLooking to trade for HOFers I need but will consider cash offers. \r\n\r\nMy scanner stinks with SGC cards.....\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=181662&d=1425446217[/IMG]",
