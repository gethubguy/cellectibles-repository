      "post_content": "I'm just wondering if it is possible at all to find a Cobb Green (preferably) or Red Portrait GRADED under $500 anywhere ???? That isn't torn or has paper loss.\r\n\r\nPretty sure this is a shot in the dark but Cobb is my favorite all time player. I have a strip card of him but it is ungraded and torn. I bought it in Cooperstown a couple summers ago. I got it mainly to feed my desire to simply own a Cobb card.\r\n\r\nT206 is my primary collection base and my holy grail would be to own a Cobb card. I have a full time job but also have a kid and child support so as most of you know (the hard way) I don't have a lot of money to spend on a Cobb but still want one bad.",
