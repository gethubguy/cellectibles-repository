      "post_content": "I've been collecting t206 cards for the better part of 6 years now and I still feel like a novice. Can anyone help with this one? I picked up the red one a few months back thinking it was the only Bill Chappelle. According to what I could find that seemed correct. Then two weeks ago the Orange background one on the left showed up on eBay. Of course I couldn't resist and got it for a very reasonable price. Not sure if it matters but they are both Piedmont 350 backs. \r\n\r\nSo the question is, what am I looking at here? A color variation or simply a card that may have missed a color pass during the printing process? It's not sun faded, you can tell from the other colors on the card. Any help or info is appreciated.\r\n\r\nRich",
