      "post_content": "Up for sale is a T206 Lenox Tom Needham.  I will post pics later today when I get home.  Although I crack all of my cards out of thier cases, I beleive this was a 1.5.  Although there are numerous creases, it is a solid clean back.  The front is a little rough (but let's be honest... who is buying a Lenox for the front?? haha).  If you would like to see a scan ASAP, email me at:  bmullen0014@aol.com or reply to this thread leaving your email address.  I will send scans quickly.  The last 1.5 sold at Goodwin Auctions for over $1500.  I believe this is a steal at $900 OBO, free shipping.  Thanks for looking!",
