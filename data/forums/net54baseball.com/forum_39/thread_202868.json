You would get better responses on the opening thread (introductions).\r\n\r\nAnd two, I don't understand the question. Did PSA put the wrong name on the label? Do the put Billy on some and Fred on others?\r\n\r\nSorry, I just don't understand what you are asking.\r\n\r\nAnd Josh, you aren't really a newbie. You have a very nice T collection.",

Haha\n\nI've just notice that I've seen both:\na t206 Fred Payne\na t206 Billy Payne\n\nIs that just PSA being idiots and labeling his card incorrectly because as far as I know his name is in fact Fred not Billy.\n\nAlso was wondering how rare a double name card is. I don't have one but could have the opportunity to get one at a real good price.",
