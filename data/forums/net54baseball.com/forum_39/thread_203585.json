I didn't get any offers that I couldn't pass up so I will be keeping Mr Pelty and (hopefully) Mr. Fitzgerald's fingerprint.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is tough to know the market price for this card so I am going to ask for offers. F Scott Fitzgerald F Stamp with a fingerprint in the ink, also on a tougher Old Mill back. \r\n\r\nAn offer I like will trump all on-going negotiations. To be clear, this means that we might be engaged in a back-and-forth where my return message lets you know that I sold it to someone else.\r\n\r\nPlease EMAIL ME through Net54 (Click on \"Jobu\" then click \"send email to Jobu\" -- whatever you do, don't click on \"drink Jobu's rum\").",

The army started fingerprinting in 1905 from what I can find online, but I can't find any solid information about whether this was mandatory for all soldiers or not. Fitzgerald died at the ripe young age of 44. I wouldn't be surprised if a copy of his fingerprint exists, but I would be surprised if it wasn't buried in some file somewhere amongst tens of thousands of other fingerprint cards, unless the government is in the habit of digitizing fingerprints of dead people. Now that I write that, that does sound like something the government would spend money on...",
