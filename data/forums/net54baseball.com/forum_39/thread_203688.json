Sorry about the crappy scan.....best I can do with SGC cards.\r\n\r\nAsking $SOLD shipped. If that is too much, feel free to make an offer.  Also willing to trade for comparable EPDG I do not have (see image below Wright).  Also willing to trade for whatever you might have that I need.\r\n\r\nOpen to anything......just don't want this extra Wright hanging around when someone else can appreciate him.  ;)",
