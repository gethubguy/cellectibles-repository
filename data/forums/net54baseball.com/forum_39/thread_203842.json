About a month or a month and a half ago there was a listing on eBay with a Kaiser Wilhelm hands at chest. On the back it was stamped Meriden CT. \r\n\r\nI'm from CT and my dad was bidding on that card. I would like to see if any of you got the card and would be willing to sell or trade for it ? Again maybe this is a long shot maybe not. I was thinking of maybe giving it to him for a Birthday gift even though I already bought us tickets to go see Alice in Chains..........",
