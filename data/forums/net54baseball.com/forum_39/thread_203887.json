      "post_content": "Hi all - this is my first foray into the B/S/T board. I am building a low-grade set of T206 cards and finding it difficult to find larger lots for sale.\n\nHere's what I'm looking for - low-grade (but not utterly destroyed) T206 commons. These can have some paper loss, writing, etc., but I'm not looking for trimmed cards or cards with a ton of damage (no backs at all, cards cut in 1/2, taped together, etc).\n\nI am finding these piecemeal on eBay in the $8.00 - $10.00 range, but looking to acquire a bunch at one time. Preferably looking for a couple of lots of 50 or more, but will consider any lots of 10 or more. Willing to come up a little for cards in slightly better shape, but not looking for anything beyond $12.00 per card.\n\nLooking to make a deal off of eBay (via Paypal) to save the seller fees and encourage this low pricing/bulk discount.\n\nAs to which cards, I'm not looking to acquire any I already have. But given that I only have 77 cards, there are a lot that I am looking for. Please feel free to send me any PMs with a list if you happen to have a bunch within that price range.\n\nThanks in advance -",
