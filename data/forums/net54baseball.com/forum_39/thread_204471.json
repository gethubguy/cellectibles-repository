      "post_content": "Well, after just getting KILLED on my T206 \"Set 2\" consignment to H&S (I mean 25%+ loss), I was about to throw in the towel and selling everything I own that even resembled a baseball card.\r\n\r\nBut, I decided to jump back on the horse that just kicked my teeth out, and do some upgrading on my main set.  Nice to say, really not to many.  Below is a list of upgrades.  I collect raw, but am an attuned slab cracker.\r\n\r\nCommons (vg)\r\n\r\nBatch\r\nBirmingham\r\nCasey\r\nDavidson\r\nDougherty, portrait\r\nDurham\r\nFreeman\r\nKonetchy, up\r\nMagee, portrait\r\nMoran, Prov.\r\nShaw, StL\r\nStone\r\n[STRIKE]Stoval, bat[/STRIKE] :) Thanks Bill\r\nWhite, portrait\r\nWilliams\r\nWiltse, pitch\r\nZimmermann\r\n\r\nSouthern Lg.
