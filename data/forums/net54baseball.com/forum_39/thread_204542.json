Asking $SOLD. \n\nI'm also open to trades for other cards that are graded in that range. I'd almost prefer a trade rather to selling it. I really like this Davis but have since got a Soverign Davis so the Pied has to go to a new home. \n\n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/album.php?albumid=748&pictureid=17966[/url]",
