All cards present very well for their grade and I feel could have just as easily been a half grade higher.  Please add $3 for shipping.  If you want all 3 make me an offer and maybe we can make a deal\r\n\r\nSorry for the sideways photos, couldn't get them to rotate\r\n\r\nSchreck:  SOLD\r\nMilligan:   SOLD\r\nHerzog:   SOLD",
