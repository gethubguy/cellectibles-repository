      "post_content": "Got this Ed Killian Portrait graded PSA 4 with Piedmont Back.  No creases or paper loss, nice corners.  Would have been a 5+ but the off center got it.  I would really like to trade it for another Ed Killian Portrait in an SGC holder graded at least SGC 50 (4) or higher.  My collection is slabbed SGC so like to keep consistent.  I would trade it straight up PSA for SGC if you got one.  Would consider other Portraits graded SGC 50 or higher also.\r\n\r\nI would also sell it for $60, add $3 shipping.  Let me know what you have in regards to trade ins\r\n\r\nThanks!",
