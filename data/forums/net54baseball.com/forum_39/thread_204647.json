      "post_content": "I will consider cash offers, trade, cash + trade, and Hoblitzell + cash if what you have to trade is a bigger card that I like. \r\n\r\nHoblitzell has the rose layer but is missing the red. The rose layer can be seen thanks to a color shift. It is evident on Hoblitzell's left side on the zoomed image on the left - you can see the same rose on the jersey in the background of the image to give the bottom of the background a darker look. The zoomed card on the right, not mine, is another Hoblitzell with a misregistration that reveals the same rose layer in the background but this card clearly also has the red layer that is missing from the card that I am selling.  \r\n\r\nPlease send me an email through Net54 if you are interested. \r\n\r\nThanks.",
