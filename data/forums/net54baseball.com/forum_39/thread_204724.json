      "post_content": "OK Dave, below is a list of pre-war cards for players born 3/12.  Unfortunately, I am unable to automate the process so you can dig out the post-war cards yourself if you are so inclined.\r\n\r\nBill James was a bit of a challenge as there were 2 players by that name playing at the same time (and both included in the Zeenuts series).  I weeded out the imposter and I believe the cards I list are all for William Lawrence James (\"Seattle Bill\").  The Beckett Baseball Card Alphabetical Checklist was of no help as it co-mingles the two players under one name.  Fortunately, I have a good Zeenut resource.\r\n\r\nGeorge Maisel\r\n1917 Zeenuts\r\n1919 Zeenuts\r\n1920 Zeenuts\r\n1921 Exhibits\r\n\r\nWilliam Lawrence James\r\n1915 Cracker Jack\r\n1916 BF2 Felt Pennants\r\n1916 Sporting News M101-5\r\n1917 Collins-McCarthy E135\r\n1917 Sporting News M101-4\r\n1917 Standard Biscuit\r\n1924 Zeenuts\r\n1925 Zeenuts\r\n\r\nAlexander Gaston\r\n1921 E121 Series of 120\r\n1921 E121 Series of 80\r\n1921 Koester's Bread World Series Issue D383\r\n1922 W501\r\n1922 W575\r\n\r\nBud Tinning (Lyle)\r\n1932 Cubs Team Issue\r\n1932 Orbit Gum Pins \"Numbered\"\r\n1932 Orbit Gum Pins \"Unumbered\"\r\n1933 Tatoo Orbit R305\r\n1934 Diamond Match Co.
