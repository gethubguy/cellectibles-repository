Sadly, it had met up with small hole puncher some years ago. \r\n\r\nImage is amazing, back is nice, corners touched but not too bad. \r\n\r\nTake a look at it. It's got plenty to recommend it, as well as a serious flaw. \r\n\r\nAsking $300. Would consider offers or trades. \r\n\r\n[URL=http://s235.photobucket.com/user/bbcard1/media/IMG_4231_zps0evetpqf.jpg.html][IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/IMG_4231_zps0evetpqf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s235.photobucket.com/user/bbcard1/media/IMG_4232_zpshbsmmomq.jpg.html][IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/IMG_4232_zpshbsmmomq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
