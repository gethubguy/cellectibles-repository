What you said here about enjoying the set vs just running through it, couldn't be more true.  It seems when you start the set, you get discouraged in a sense because you know it's a long haul until you finish it, but the end isn't what you should be looking forward to, it's the middle part...\r\n\r\nGood luck on your journey, Josh and remember to enjoy every step of the way!",
