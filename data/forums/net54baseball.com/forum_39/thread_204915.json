      "post_content": "I'm going to try this as a lot first, then if it doesn't sell after a few days, I'll put individual prices on them, but I'd rather move them as a lot and priced it that way. If you really want one card, make an offer.\n\n  The Helm card has blue background in the corner, where it should be all green. There is some blue border showing on the right side up top, hard to see in the scan. It's in rough shape(taped), but it's an interesting missing color.\n\n  The Butler card has double eyebrows on the front and double factory on the back, plus some extra ink\n\n  The Griffith is probably missing color due to the back damage, light red on the jersey/color and the background is all orange.\n\n  The Barry has extra blue all over the front borders\n\n  The Hoffman is a huge card\n\n  The Beaumont is miscut top to bottom on the back\n\n  MOVED TO AUCTION CATEGORY",
