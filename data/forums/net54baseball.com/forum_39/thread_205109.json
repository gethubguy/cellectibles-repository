SGC grade 30 (2)  \r\n\r\nJust looking for a nice 3 PSA or SGC \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nwould like to trade.  Primarily looking for a Green Cobb or Cobb Bat off.  Low grade PSA or SGC with nice eye appeal.  I will consider other Hall of Famers (doesnt neccessarily have to be T206) but these are my first priority.  Obviously will add cash when neccessary.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you have\r\n\r\nThanks",
