I thought you meant other cards like them of course..as they were listed as SOLD for Months..or thought you were just yanking my chain........i did have an additional 2 Green cobbs (plus i do come across them)  but they had sold in a group but obviously the price of what you would of paid for the ones on net54 would  be relevant to see if were in the same ballpark so i asked...\n\n\nYou going to ask to buy the 1955 PSA 7.5 Banks?  How about the Jackie Robinson PSA 5 that sold a year ago...   I thought it was silly to offer 4k for a green cobb that goes for 8k..i guess those were the historical prices you were looking at...\n\nplus MANY MANY  posts about that the green cobbs had sold.....i think people complained that i kept mentioning about those cards sold too many times...............  maybe you should spend more time looking at the listings to see if a card has sold or not then lowballing and you wont waste peoples time....\n\n\nI thought your offer of 4k was really really lowballing for that type of card that goes for 7-8k... i was polite in my response....but yeah i guess i should of said i wont ever think to contact you if come across one... i did give you some fluff in that last response but i thought it was nicer than saying 'why are you lowballing'...\n\nfunny you are the one that offered 4k that is thousands below what the card is worth and you attacking me...  great use of historical pricing..\n\n\nI honestly didnt think you were serious about any of the exact green cobbs cards on net54 i had listed  as everyone and their mother knew they were sold ...months before your email.....but figured since i had other 4s i could see if you were serious...which you werent..  sorry for the misundestanding",

I NEVER SAID THEY WERE STILL FOR SALE. ....i asked how much for either of the cards that were listed.......i didnt say how much for either card that is for sale... you can assume whatever you want...but i never said they were for still for sale\n\n\nI do think everyone on net54 knew those cards were sold....heck on this thread i mentioned them being sold yet again....and you piped in with your comments...  if someone asks me about whether those cards are for sale now, yeah im going to say how much do you want to offer for them  because only an idiot would still think they are available but if they are serious i would let them know immediately thereafter that if i came across a card like that to see if its worth my time to obtain....\n\nyou certainly harbor some ill will to bring something up from 9 months ago where my last comment was very polite to you...........funny you said ZERO until now... you didnt have any problems until now.",
