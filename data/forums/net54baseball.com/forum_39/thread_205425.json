      "post_content": "I am working through a T206 set and a little more than halfway to my goal of a 518-card set.\r\n\r\nI'm in need of lower grade commons, paying between $8-$12 for ones I need. Before I was looking for only lots, but I will take singles now, too. These can be significantly damaged, just not looking for utterly destroyed cards (i.e. cards missing significant chunks, cards taped together, a lot of writing, etc). Cards with creasing, stains, some paper loss, etc. are all fine.\r\n\r\nBecause I still need over 200 cards, I'd rather not write out my entire 'Need' list. But if you have any you are looking to sell, please message me and I'll check it against my list.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
