      "post_content": "I have five T206 cards here. The Batch has a miscut front, where you can see the blue from another card(likely a Batch) on the bottom. The Huslwitt has a big miss on the brown layer, so you can see a ghosting to the side of his head and his body and the bat are in the border. The Owen card has a double name, double factory on the back. The other two cards are commons. Murray looks real nice, but it is trimmed. Bowerman was bought because the B is light and it has no back damage.\r\n\r\nHulswitt $55\r\nBatch $55\r\nOwen $70\r\nMurray and Bowerman $40(total, not each, being sold as a pair)\r\n\r\nOr $180 for all of them. Paypal please. Insured delivery is included in prices.",
