The only real defect is the pencil mark on the back.\r\n\r\nYou send me $20 (PP FF) and I'll ship Jimmy to you. He'll be between cardboard, in a bubble envelope and he'll have a tracking number.\r\n\r\nClaim on here and shoot me a PM for PP address.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s326.photobucket.com/user/xplainer2010/media/2015-05-17%20a%20001_zpswuw1qtum.jpg.html][IMG]http://i326.photobucket.com/albums/k407/xplainer2010/2015-05-17%20a%20001_zpswuw1qtum.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n[URL=http://s326.photobucket.com/user/xplainer2010/media/2015-05-17%20a%20002_zps2roqnkir.jpg.html][IMG]http://i326.photobucket.com/albums/k407/xplainer2010/2015-05-17%20a%20002_zps2roqnkir.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
