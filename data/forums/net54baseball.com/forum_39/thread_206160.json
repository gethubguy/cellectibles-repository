      "post_content": "Probably 5 years ago I decided to pick up my first t206 because of it's iconic stature. I mean you're not really a baseball card collector without owning a single t206 are you? I didn't know what card to get. Cobb, Matty, WaJo, or Young would all have been great choices but I ran across a guy who shares my same last name: Wilhelm. At that point I thought the selection was simple. Get a Wilhelm t206 and call it a day. The guy is a common and I don't have deep pockets so it would be a perfect fit. I knew nothing about The Monster at that point. I bought a Wilhelm batting pose and thought it was over. How wrong I was!!!!!! I soon discovered there was another Wilhelm pose and later discovered there were 27 combined different backs of this guy. Several years later I'm still searching for 5 cards to complete a quest I never even knew existed when I started with a single card. Can anyone help? \n\n\nHere is what I need:\n\nBatting\nAmerican Beauty 460\nDrum 350\nPiedmont 460 factory 42\nUzit\n\nHands at Chest\nHindu\n\nThank you,\nBrandt",
