      "post_content": "Both came out of PSA 1 holders. Both have decent eye appeal. The Cobb Red has wrinkles and paper loss on the back. However, it's still a decent looking low grade card. The Bat On has great eye appeal. The reason for the low grade is a pin hole in the card. Otherwise, a nice looking front and a clean back.  $600 for the Bat On, $xxx for Red.  Purchase the Bat On and you can have the Cobb Red for $xxx.  You're not going to find any cheaper than that!  Ill be happy to email or text any additional pictures. Purchase with complete confidence as I've recently sold some nice T206's as I'm starting to upgrade.  ***Red Cobb Sold***\r\n\r\nBrendan.",
