If you have one that's aesthetically better and want to downgrade and pick up some cash, let me know to see whether we can work a trade. All of the cards below are graded; I can let anyone who's interested know the number on the flip. I'm interested in only trading the same cards; I'll have to pass on a PSA 5 Piedmont 350 portrait for the lower-grade Uzit batting pose.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that on the Sweet Caporals, factory numbers matter.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com [/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/bat-ab460.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/bat-uzit.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/throw-sc-150-fact-25.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/port-hindu.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/port-oldmill_1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/port-pied-350.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/port-sov-350.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/t206/port-sc350-fact-25.jpg[/IMG]",
