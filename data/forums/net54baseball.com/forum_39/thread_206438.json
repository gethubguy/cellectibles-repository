      "post_content": "I'm looking for low-to-mid-grade examples of the four Cubs T206 HOFers -- Tinker, Evers, Chance, and Brown -- that are reasonably affordable and have decent eye appeal. Spots of paper loss on the back of an otherwise presentable card, for example, or a crease or two that are not too obtrusive. Preferably raw, but that's not absolutely necessary. I have the two Evers non-portraits (Cubs on uniform and Chicago on uniform), but not any of the others. If you have anything that might be of interest, either PM me or e-mail me at [url]djk1@ix.netcom.com[/url].",
