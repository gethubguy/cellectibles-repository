      "post_content": "For sale are 22 Different T-206 cards including 16 missing color, 3 Tweener Scraps, 1 EPDG Jones, 1 Marquard comma and 1 Donnie Bush Orange variation.\r\n\r\nMost of the missing color cards came from one seller and a lot of talk was about whether the soaking or glue caused the color variances. Your call on that interpretation. \r\n\r\nI am looking for offers at this point on any and all. I have an idea of value but would rather hear offers over the weekend before I shoot them off to some type of auction.\r\n\r\nSGC 10 Tom Jones EPDG \r\nSGC 20 Donie Bush Orange Background****SOLD****\r\nSGC A Eddie Collins Tweener Scrap\r\nSGC A Clyde Milan Tweener Scrap\r\nSGC A Doc White Pitching Tweener Scrap\r\nPSA 1 Marquard Portrait With Comma\r\n\r\nPSA 1.5MC Dave Brain\r\nPSA 1 Viva Lindaman\r\nPSA A Ed Konetchy Glove above head\r\nPSA A Roger Bresnahan Portrait\r\nPSA A Frank Arrellanes\r\nPSA A Johnny Bates ****SOLD***\r\nPSA 1.5 Ginger Beaumont****SOLD***\r\nPSA 1.5 Frank Bowerman***SOLD****\r\nPSA 1 Heinie Wagner Bat on Left Shoulder\r\nPSA A Claude Ritchey****SOLD****\r\nPSA A Tubby Spencer (labeled missing red ink)\r\nPSA 3 Fred Beck (labeled missing red ink)\r\nPSA A Mike Mitchell\r\nPSA A Bob Spade\r\nPSA 1 Harry Gasper\r\nPSA 1 Mike Mowrey",
