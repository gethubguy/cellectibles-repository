Zack Wheat SGC 20 Piedmont - This is a really nice card actually it really looks like a 4 or 5, no creases sharp corners, clean back.  SGC is really hard on paper loss and the right upper corner has paper chipping thus the low grade.  You will not find a better 1.5 than this one  Could probably get a nice upgrade with PSA SOLD\r\n\r\n4. Wid Conroy PSA 3.5  Piedmont.  Really nice card, vibrant colors.  SOLD\r\n\r\n5. Joe Birmingham SGC 20 - Has its issues, creases, rounded corners and some spots/stains not undergraded.  SOLD",
