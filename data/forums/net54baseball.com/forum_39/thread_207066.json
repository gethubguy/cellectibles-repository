      "post_content": "Keeler BVG 3 (Sweet Corporal 350 back) is an extremely sharp looking card and only has very mild touches to the corners and light toning on the reverse keeping it from being graded higher.  No wrinkling! ...  asking $185\r\n\r\nHuggins BVG 2 (Piedmont 350 back) has a wrinkle across the middle but no other significant wear exists on the card and the back is perfectly clean and damage free...  Asking $65\r\n\r\n*** Just noticed the spot in the upper right hand corner on the Keeler.  That is not wear or anything on the card...that's actually glare from the camara!\r\n\r\nPrices include shipping for both.  Thanks in advance!\r\nBrian\r\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=193636&d=1433723310[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=193637&d=1433723321[/IMG]",

One thing I should mention is that while the card is in a VG holder, there are tiny black flecks on the card which I'm assuming is of the dirt/debris variety. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=194454&d=1434420905[/IMG]",
