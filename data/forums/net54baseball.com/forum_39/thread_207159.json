This SGC 35 copy presents very well and is worthy of your consideration.  No fee payments are okay in any form.  \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/22265/pastorius[/IMG]\r\n\r\nand if you don't like that one, try this PSA 4 copy of Jim Pastorius on for size.  SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/10488/pastorius[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperation Pastorius will be rolled out in phases.  Due to the exceptional eye appeal of these cards relative to their grade, the initial Phase 1 is Exhibition, where collectors simply marvel at the beauty of these cards.  No sticker will be affixed to these cards as it is clear that they stand on their own merit.  Phase 1 will last no longer than 48 hours.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 will begin on Thursday evening or earlier, interested parties are invited to ask questions related to a potential purchase of one of these cards for their own collection.  Offers to buy will be accepted and responded to in the order received.  \r\n\r\nOnce the new owner(s) of these cards is determined, payment will be made and the cards will be prepared for travel to their new home.  Phase 3 should proceed rather quickly.\r\n\r\nPhase 4 will mark the end of the busy work involved in the transactions and the cards will be mailed directly to the new owner(s) in a timely manner with tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nPhase 5 will be marked by the arrival of the Pastorius fleet wherever it might land.  The shock and awe of the new owner will then commence on opening his parcel.",
