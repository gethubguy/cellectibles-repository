      "post_content": "Card is perfectly centered (not common with this card) and has razor sharp corners. Don't settle for a 2 or 3 with extremely rounded corners, and bad centering. This card has some very tiny paper loss, (Scans below, thanks for posting Trae) This is a fantastic opportunity to get a sharp green Cobb for a fraction of the price. $2950 delivered. Reduced!, card is offered now at $2275! an absolute ton of card for the money.....If you ever believe in buying the card and not the holder, here you go. As of 9/26 I will sell for $1995 this weekend only, an SGC 40 with rounded corners and crease just went for $3k.....**SOLD**",
