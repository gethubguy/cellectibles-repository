      "post_content": "I'm continuing on my quest to get a large amount of unique EPDG's. I think I'm around 115.  I have 3 of the 4 Chase cards which are available with that back and need the dark cap to complete the group. Anyone have a dark cap Chase with an EPDG back? Condition is not important....but not looking for a high end copy either.\r\n\r\nAlso, I need 2 more commons, in any back. They are Donovan throwing and Sheckard no glove. Any back is fine, preferred to be in the 1.5 to 3.5 range graded, but raw is good too.\r\n\r\nI can pay cash and also have t206s for trade, including a few low grade HOFers and some EPDGs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks",
