      "post_content": "are cited by name in the Crazy '08, which chronicles two of the best pennant races in both leagues in a single year 1908, the year before the ATC tobacco card craze began.\r\n\r\nCrazy 08 by Cait Murphy is a delightful read that any prewar card collector should enjoy.  I did.  Keeping the book, read only by me, on a shelf or in a box seems unfair, so I am more than willing to send it to a new owner.  There is a small check mark by the T206ers in the index. Otherwise the book is unmarked and in near new condition.  This is the paperback edition.  Asking $10 and Media Mail shipping is on me.\r\n\r\nI will also stick one of the two ungraded cards (Tom Jones or Demmitt NY), that I have listed in this section of the forum, in the book and pass the savings on to you if you chose.  Let's make it $32 for the book and Jones and $28 for the book and Demmitt.",
