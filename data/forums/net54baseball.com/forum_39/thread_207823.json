Is it really that tough - hence the high price?",

The prices from recent auction houses is way high and I would suspect it was the whole \"2 guys really wanted it\"  more than it being rare.  \r\n\r\nBetween SGC and PSA, there are about 20 graded Keeler batting with EPDG backs.  That's pretty high for EPDG but of course HOFers are graded more often than commons.\r\n\r\nLive Auctioneers showed an SGC 60 sold at the January Saco auction for 650.\r\n\r\nLets see some scans!",
