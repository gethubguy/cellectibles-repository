      "post_content": "Heading for Chicago this year, but thought I'd start shopping for a few things early, maybe I can narrow my list before I get there.\n\nI'm focused mostly on eye appeal over technical grade, but figure most of what would fall in my budget would be PSA 3 to PSA 6 on most of these.\n\nI like to display these amongst my autograph items, so they need to look good!\n\nI also prefer the portraits, but would consider any.\n\nHere's what I'm currently in the market for in T206s:\nTy Cobb\nChristy Mathewson\nTris Speaker\nNap Lajoie\nWalter Johnson\nCy Young\nEddie Collins\nWillie Keeler\nRoger Bresnahan\nFred Clarke\nJimmy Collins\nHugh Duffy\nHughie Jennings\n\nPlease PM me with anything you've got - thanks!",
