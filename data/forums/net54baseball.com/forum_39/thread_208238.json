While it has reasonable low grade appeal, it was returned (many years ago by the previous owner) by SGC as legitimate, but altered to too great of an extent to receive an A...as you can see the lower right hand corner has apparently come off and been repasted. Some other company might holder it, but honestly I don't use ho\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have upgraded.  I would also consider trades for players of comparable stature. \r\n\r\n[URL=http://s235.photobucket.com/user/bbcard1/media/IMG_4366_zps5mbvv4er.jpg.html][IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/IMG_4366_zps5mbvv4er.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s235.photobucket.com/user/bbcard1/media/IMG_4367_zpsucq0ptgq.jpg.html][IMG]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee291/bbcard1/IMG_4367_zpsucq0ptgq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nAny questions just pm me.",
