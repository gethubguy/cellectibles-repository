      "post_content": "----------------------\r\nHey folks.....Continuing to get rid of dupes.  \r\n\r\nMost of the cards are on ebay with higher prices.  Better scans on photobucket [URL=\"http://s856.photobucket.com/user/thromdog/library/PSA?sort=3&page=1\"]available here[/URL].  As you can tell, there are a lot of these cards that look better than the grade.....a lot of the 1's look surprisingly nice as do some of the 2's.\r\n\r\nAs for price, depends on how many and who, so PM me with what you want and I'll let you know....you'll definitely get a good cut off ebay price.\r\n\r\nCards ship first class with tracking.  Paypal FF or mail me a check/MO.\r\n\r\nGRADED\r\n\r\n\r\n****ALL SOLD****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$SOLD George McQuillan batting PSA 1\r\n$SOLD George Stone PSA 1 (mk)\r\n$SOLD George Gibson PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Lee Quillen PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Hobe Ferris PSA 2.5\r\n$SOLD Moose Grimshaw PSA 2 \r\n$SOLD Frank Smith F Smith PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Bill Maloney PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Cy Seymour Portrait PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Doc Crandall no cap PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Buck Herzog Boston PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Dick Hoblitzell PSA 1 \r\n$SOLD Red Ames hands chest PSA 3 \r\n$SOLD Hooks Wiltse no cap portrait PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Germany Schaefer Detroit PSA 2 (mc)\r\n$SOLD Harry McIntyre Brooklyn and Chicago PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Lou Criger PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Bob Rhoades hands chest PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Jack Knight Portrait PSA 1\r\n$SOLD Jimmy Lavender SGC35 - P350\r\n$SOLD Kaiser Wilhelm hands chest PSA 2 (mk)\r\n$SOLD Newt Randall PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Jerry Downs PSA 3 - SC350/25\r\n$SOLD Lee Tannehill (L.
