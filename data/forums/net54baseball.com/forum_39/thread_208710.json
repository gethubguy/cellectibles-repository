      "post_content": "T206 card with the tougher TOLSTOI back of VIC WILLIS (HOF) of the St. Louis Cardinals in a throwing pose.  Graded SGC 55 (VG/EX+ 4.5).  This nicely centered card has a light wet sheet transfer (I think this is what this is called) on the front.  The PSA & SGC pop reports each show 7 of these cards - only 3 graded higher in the combined reports.  Price is $299 delivered for payment via check or money order ($308 via PayPal).  I prefer email to PM.  CARD IS SOLD!\r\nVal Kehl\r\n[url]ekehl333@aol.com[/url]",
