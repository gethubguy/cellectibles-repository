      "post_content": "Hi Everyone......I have been scuffling with what to do to feed the cardboard monkey. I have settled on sliding into slabs for the Monster. I have a nice collection but it is mainly raw. I am looking to get slabbed versions of all. I am really looking for 40/45 (50 if the price is right). PSA is OK as well. I am looking for 20 or 25 in total to start......... Let me know what you have and I am sure we can get something working.......Thanks for reading this post.....Mike\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 15, 2015... Down to 20 S/L & 9 Commons guys..... Anybody have ANY of theses remaining cards?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 21, 2015... The Finish Line is close. I only need 15 Southern Leaguers and 6 Commons.   \r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 25, 2015... 15 S/L and 3\"Commons\" to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n HELP!!!! PLEASE!!!\r\n***** ADDED: 23 SL-ers (DOWN TO 15 NOW!) that I need in a slab.....PSA 2/SGC 30 (though I have seen some SGC 20 that would work)*****\r\n\r\n22. Jack Bastian\r\n175. Charlie Fritz\r\n206. Gordon Hickman\r\n213. Bock Hooker\r\n244. J. F. Kiernan\r\n332. Carlton Molesworth\r\n377. Arch Persons\r\n473. Woodie Thornton\r\n495. Foley White\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...and I still need:\r\n1. Ed Abbaticchio (Blue Sleeves)\r\n479. Terry Turner\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nUPDATE: AUGUST 19, 2015... Thanks to all of the folks that have responded so far, I have reach the 100 common slab plateau.  I had 54 when I started this slab in/raw out exercise. I have picked up 46 since the original date of this thread, July 26,2015. Hot Damn! The out-going raw cards are lagging just a little. They can be seen/purchased in my  $23 or Less thread [URL=\"http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=211250\"]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=211250[/URL], presently a few threads down from this here on the BST. Despite the slower sales than purchases.... I am still looking to add more slabs!!!! Anybody that can help a fella out?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: AUGUST 25, 2015... Well, it has been a slow week. I HAVE picked up 4 more, three from here on the BST and one from the 'Bay. I am still looking to grab a few more. If you have any or get any in the future please reach out to me. I am sure we can work a deal.\r\nHere is a ridiculously long list (though not as long as it was a few weeks ago:):D) of what I NEED:\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 1,  2015...  A steady week brings me a slightly fat dozen slabs closer.....I am STILL looking for more.....The list grows shorter still.........  Down to 248 left. Can ya help a fella out?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 4,  2015... Things have slowed to a crawl.......Is there anybody out there????????:D:)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 9,  2015...  STILL LOOKING FELLAS!!! Help me chop this list some more............\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 14, 2015... Things have been chugging along but I have been remiss in sending out a big group \"thank you\" to all the guys here and on the Bay that have helped me move this project along. The list is still crazy big but it is shrinking steadily. As I type this, it sits at a mere 214 :D\r\nNeedless to say, I am STILL LOOKING. I may not reach the finish line but I am going to give it one Helluva try.........\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 22, 2015... Steady progress over the last week or so has the magic number down to 166. Yes I am still looking for more. PM me and we can get it done!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: September 29, 2015...       143 to go..... Anyone?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: October 6, 2015...  Inside of 100 now, coming down the home stretch...........Now 93 to go. Does anybody have any of these?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: October 19, 2015... Down to 77. Admittedly, I am getting down to mostly Commons with a Premium. I am STILL looking for more though.......... \r\n\r\nUPDATE: October 26, 2015... Hey Guys...I am down to 72 commons left to get....Anyone have any of these?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 2, 2015...  The End is in sight my friends. Down to 55.  Any have any of the guys left on my list? (It is much more easy to read these 3 months later)\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 6, 2015... Down to the Final 45 Can anyone help?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 6, 2015...  ONLY 18 MORE I Know that I am getting down to the tougher \"commons\", but can anybody out there help me put this project to bed?",
