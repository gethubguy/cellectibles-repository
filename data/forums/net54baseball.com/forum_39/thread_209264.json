Scott Fitzgerald during his younger years, I personally have never been able to find anything whatsoever that can be considered proof of the provenance.\r\n\r\nI am looking for HOF in lower condition, just no beaters please. \r\n\r\nI already have: Flick, E. Collins, Johnson - portrait, Crawford - batting, McGraw - portrait; no cap\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
