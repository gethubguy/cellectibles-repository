      "post_content": "I have the topps huge coffee table book from 1990 with nearly 700 autographs in it.  I have contacted REA to possibly put it in an auction, but what I really want is to further my very small t206 collection.  I have been getting autographs in the book since 1990 and have 51 HOF's in it including DiMaggio, Mantle, Aaron, Mays etc.  it also have 62 deceased signatures.  I can email pictures if you are really interested.  The book comes with a binder full of game or event ticket stubs, show flyers and write ups of how and when each signature was attained.  High level provenance if that is what you call it.  I would estimate the book in the $2000-$5000 range. I am not looking for high quality HOF's as some of you could trade one card for my book, what I am looking for is 300-350ish low grade commons and HOF's to get a huge jump on the set.  Anyways, thanks for reading and hopefully someone will be interested in a trade.  I will also entertain monetary offers, to cut out the middle man, but really, I want to trade this book for a good portion of a low grade t206 set.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul",
