      "post_content": "Pardon the interruption, I have my Magie up for auction in the Huggins & Scott auction ending tonight, lot #14.  Take a look!\r\n\r\nA little history, I've had the card some 15 or so years, it was always just a place holder and it was time to send it back into the Hobby world.  It was slabbed by GAI as a 1 and had a very early serial #.  PSA would not cross it over as I guess their recent history with this card is not the greatest (people who follow PSA and Magie will understand that comment, nuff said).  I finally decided to send it to SGC and they slabbed it Auth.\r\n\r\nI'm the first to say this one is rough, especially the back, but hey it is the real deal and these only come around so often, so take a look and if you have any questions, let me know by PM.\r\n\r\nHave a great day and don't let it get away, \r\n\r\ntake care, Joe (obcjoe)",
