Portrait's are my main focus.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for cards in PSA 3-5 range (would consider SGC and BVG as well but I prefer PSA).\r\n\r\nI do NOT want creases but rounded corners generally don't bother me.\r\nI do not want any with paper loss, I'm not picky about the backs.\r\nI'd like pretty good centering as well, but overall looking for cards that display nicely as I'm going to display these.\r\n\r\nPM is best way to reach me, but you can post in the thread as well if you'd like.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'm looking for:\r\nTy Cobb red\r\nTy Cobb green\r\nWalter Johnson\r\nChristy Mathewson\r\nTris Speaker\r\nJohn McGraw\r\nEddie Collins\r\nWillie Keeler\r\nRoger Bresnahan\r\nFred Clarke\r\nJimmy Collins\r\nHugh Duffy\r\nHughie Jennings\r\nFrank Chance yellow or red\r\nJack Chesbro\r\nJohnny Evers\r\nClark Griffith\r\nJoe Mcginnity\r\nJoe Tinker\r\nRube Waddell\r\nEd Walsh\r\nMordecai Brown\r\nChief Bender\r\nBobby Wallace\r\nFrank Baker\r\n\r\n\r\nI have these that I might consider trading for the right deal:\r\nCy Young portrait Piedmont SGC 60 (I would consider \"trading down\" to a slightly lower grade Young, otherwise this is not available)\r\nNap Lajoie throwing Piedmont PSA 4\r\nNap Lajoie batting Old Mill SGC 50\r\nNap Lajoie portrait Piedmont SGC 55",
