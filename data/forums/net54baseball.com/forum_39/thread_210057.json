Got the authentic grade from SGC due to having been hand cut from a sheet. \n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains109/duffy_zpszwbkummx.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains113/duffy_zpsnm19spbz.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAsking $650 for the Duffy\n\nElmer Flick Piedmont\n\nHuge card side to side, measures 1 11/16\" at the middle. This card has also been hand cut from a sheet, with an unmistakable bow cut on the larger size border. Again graded as authentic by SGC due to having been hand cut. Front and back are super clean.\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains108/5d67950c-3f41-4b2d-b6d8-b103f3fa784c_zps712gqbsw.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains113/acf33a81-0640-4bbb-acb8-0e32a1b2f8c0_zpspzqepip9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAsking $350 for the Flick\n\nTom C",

The Duffy is the far more dramatic cut and is in better condition overall, so I would expect to get a fair amount more for that one.\r\n\r\nAs with anything, they are worth what someone is willing to pay. If the offers that come in are lower than I think is justified I will hold them for a bit or perhaps look to an auction house.\r\n\r\nTom C",
