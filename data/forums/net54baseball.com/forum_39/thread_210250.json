      "post_content": "Greetings Fellas.\r\n\r\nThere are a few combos I am interested in acquiring for my rare back collection, and the following three can be used in trade: Tinker- Lenox, Evers - Broad Leaf, Bender - Carolina Brights.\r\n\r\nI am interested in the following: Young and Johnson Brown Hindu's, a HOF Broad Leaf 460 (lol), and a Lajoie batting (I am a bit more open for the back on this one, although the very, very scarce American Beauty 460 or Cycle 460 would be pretty amazing).\r\n\r\nOn a side note: is there anyone who has a spare Eddie Plank lying around that they would trade for my rare back HOF run? :D\r\n\r\nIf you want to chat trade give me a jingle. Thank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\nDerek",
