      "post_content": "Selling this as a group only. My guess is you won't have many opportunities to buy a southern league group this size that has such a high percentage of Hindus, simply because most sellers would choose to move the Hindus by themselves. This is an excellent start to the complete 48-card SL subset or just the 34-card Hindu subset, or you could break it up and sell individually, something I just don't want to do right now.\r\n\r\nBreakdown of backs:\r\n\r\nHindu (9)\r\nOld Mill (6)\r\nPiedmont (4).\r\n\r\nBreakdown of grades (PSA and SGC combined):\r\n\r\n5 (2)\r\n4 (1)\r\n3 (2)\r\n2.5 (3)\r\n2 (4)\r\n1 (6)\r\nA (1)\r\n\r\nHighlights include a Hindu Greminger and Revelle, an SGC 3 Hindu Howard and two SGC 5 Old Mills (Carey, Orth).\r\n\r\nI have no interest in breaking up the group. If it doesn't sell, I'll probably just put together another SL subset. You can never have too many, right? Because of the number of cards, I tried to keep the scans to a manageable size. If you need larger ones of particular cards, just let me know.\r\n\r\nA list of the group:\r\n\r\nBernhard, Old Mill, PSA 4\r\nCarey, Old Mill, SGC 5\r\nFoster, Piedmont, SGC 1\r\nFritz, Hindu, SGC 2\r\nGreminger, Hindu, SGC 1\r\nHooker, Old Mill, SGC 2.5\r\nHoward, Hindu, SGC 3\r\nJordan, Piedmont, SGC 2\r\nMiller, Old Mill, PSA 3\r\nMolesworth, Hindu, SGC 1\r\nOrth, Old Mill, SGC 5\r\nOtey, Hindu, SGC 1\r\nPersons, Hindu, SGC 2.5\r\nReagan, Hindu, PSA A\r\nRevelle, Hindu, SGC 2\r\nRockenfeld, Old Mill, SGC 1\r\nThebo, Piedmont, SGC 2\r\nViolat, Hindu, SGC 1\r\nWestlake, Piedmont, SGC 2.5\r\n\r\nPrice is $xx,xxx delivered within the United States only. For those who like to negotiate, I don't want to dampen your enthusiasm, but I put together an SL master set during the past 4-5 years, so I'm aware of the market. I've priced this to sell, because these are extras I've picked up while buying larger lots that included cards I needed. I would do better selling these individually, but I have no desire to pack and ship 19 cards. I also have no desire to simply \"move\" this at any cost.\r\n\r\nAt this price, I do not want to take the 3 percent hit on PayPal, so payment by check or money order might be the way to go. If we've done business before with no issues, I will ship once you commit to purchase.\r\n\r\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes:\r\n\r\nFeel free to [URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]email any questions[/URL].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob D.\r\n\r\nVP Sports Cards\r\n\r\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol dot com[/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ineedanap/otherphotos/southern-6.jpg[/IMG]",
