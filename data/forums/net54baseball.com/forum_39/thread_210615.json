I am willing to pay a decent amount for any that you have!\r\n\r\nI can't afford extremely rare backs, but I am willing to buy Old Mills, EPDG's and backs of similar scarcity.\r\n\r\nBuying Raw or PSA graded, using PayPal.\r\n\r\nI also have a Spike Shannon T206 PSA 1 for trade! In return I am looking for either a Raw Dineen, or a PSA 1/Authentic Dineen!\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n~Owen\r\n\r\nNOTE: Will send scan of Shannon if requested. :D",
