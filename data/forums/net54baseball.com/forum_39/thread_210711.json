The Piedmont 350 reverse version of Christy is offered for $SOLD.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10270/mathewson-white-cap[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSecond is a \"prince\" of a card or perhaps just a card of Prince Hal.  Fortunately his injury could have been worse.  Because he was turning to throw, his GSW merely grazed his right elbow.  Despite the injury the card does have the \"Apple\" green Sovereign 350 reverse.  If your back run does not require a full back, this is the card for you.  It is not graded for obvious reasons.  Asking $42 shipped for Chase with the dark cap.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/23250/chase-dark-cap-app-sov[/IMG]",
