      "post_content": "I am offering for sale my T206 Bill Lattimore SGC10 with the \"F\" stamp on the reverse which legend has it was placed there by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  The price is $250 plus postage and insurance. It is \"For Sale\" only, no trades.  Email me at [url]rgncubs@att.net[/url] if you want the card.  The upside is the card is already gradaed and thus verifiable as one of the original \"F\" stamped cards.  \r\n\r\nAlso, check out my N302 Mayo Cut Plug Frank Hinkey on the Everything else board.",
