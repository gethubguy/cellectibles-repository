      "post_content": "Looking for low-grade/very low-grade Southern Leaguers for my set. I have a few but need most. The only ones I currently have are: Bill Bernhard, Cad Coles, Jimmy Hart, James Lafitte, Perry Lipe, Pat McCauley, Molly Miller, Carlton Molesworth, Ike Rockenfeld, Carlos Smith, Tony Thebo, and James Westlake. Need everyone else.\r\n\r\nLooking mostly in the $30-$35 range per card. Perhaps slightly less for an absolute beater or slightly more for something not quite as bad. $40 per card is my absolute max right now.\r\n\r\nNot looking for cards ripped completely in half, etc., but very poor condition is fine, including writing, paper loss, clipped corners, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks",
