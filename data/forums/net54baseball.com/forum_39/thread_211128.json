Take the pair for $110 or $60 ea.\r\n\r\nAbbaticchio was one of my first T206s - purchased in about 1992.  Looks like it may be trimmed, but looks really nice, none-the-less.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x51/frohme/9349_zpsual4uuff.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLeach has been with me for 15 years or so.  Gorgeous card - also likely trimmed.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x51/frohme/10009_zpscdbftfsi.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike",
