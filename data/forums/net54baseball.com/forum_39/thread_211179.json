I don't see a speck of gold on that T205 border.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThe story of getting that card slabbed is mind-numbing.  I attempted to get it done in person at the 2013 Chicago show.  I handed the card to SGC and they said that they would certainly mention the ghosting, but the next day when I went to pick it up, it wasn't done and they said they would NOT say anything about the ghost.  I argued with them repeatedly about it each time I went to pick it up, but in the end all they could do was fvck up the label.\r\n\r\nI was so focused on the fact that the label didn't mention the ghost, that I never noticed it said T205.  I didn't realize it until someone here pointed it out earlier this year.\r\n\r\nStill, when I 'need' cards slabbed, I go to SGC.  They are like Jesus Montero, Mike Zunino and several other Mariners that can't quite get it done - loads of potential for way too many years.  It time for them to either start performing or be put on waivers.",
