I got a few replies to post number 44 that were cards I already have, and one inquiry from a non-responsive collector. Maybe adding this HOFer will pique more interest. \r\n\r\nI can add cash or cards for a graded 5 or a tougher SLer like Foster or Shag. I will also consider a HOFer I need.",

I value them more than a normal card, so I probably wouldn't want to sell.  Looking for something unique, or middle tier tough backs.",
