I purchased it within a few years ago from a great board member...I hate to move on from it, but I must!\n\n\n\nThe pics say it all, but a few details that will help along the way:\n\n\n\n*There is a small spot of paper loss on the back, right beside the \"S\" in \"Subjects\"...it's a thin spot of paper loss and it's in a great spot, so it's tough to see and doesn't distract from the overall appeal.\n\n\n\n*Zero creases and beautiful front\n\n\n\nAsking $135 SALE PENDING\n\n\n\nEvery payment accepted, please contact me via PM or email (cavelyon@aol.com) with any questions...thanks for looking!",
