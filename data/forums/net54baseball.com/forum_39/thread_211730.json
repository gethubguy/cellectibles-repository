      "post_content": "Tough front/back combo. This is the only Tolstoi Baker to be issued a grade of SGC 60, so this card is one of one, with only one graded higher (SGC 80). For comparison purposes, there is also one PSA 5 and one PSA 6 version, but none higher than that. Asking $700 delivered; PayPal preferred. This is not a reverse auction, so snag it before it goes to eBay.",
