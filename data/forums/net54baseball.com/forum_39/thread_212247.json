When in fact they list him as a Left Fielder playing for Detroit. \r\n\r\nThe card itself is a picture of Matty McIntyre and PSA slabs it as Harry........... Anyone have the scoop on this?\r\n\r\nAnd no this isn't my card (I wish it was though).",

I'm still wondering why every checklist I've looked at lists the card as Harry lol.\n\n\nBTW I know this is in the wrong section so sorry everyone.\n\n\nOops missed the part of UER thanks again Dennis !",
