      "post_content": "Here is a trimmed T206 Ginger Beaumont from the 150 series. There's not a single example of this card on eBay under $100, so it must be relatively scarce. I'll take $50 for this one, and that includes shipping. PayPal, checks and money orders are okay. See the scans for condition, and please let me know if you have any questions ...\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, Chris\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my eBay listings at: [url]www.ebay.com/usr/ccmcnutt[/url]\r\n\r\nMy collection: [url]www.imageevent.com/ccmcnutt[/url]",
