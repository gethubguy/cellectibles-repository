      "post_content": "+++ 10/24 ADDED CRAVATH AND MCALEESE IN POST BELOW.+++\r\n\r\nCurrently have 146 unique EPDG's but have a few dupes I'd like to trade if possible.  I have Seven EPDG dupes.  Both are available for trade.  \r\n\r\nLooking to trade for ones I don't have. But once one is traded, the other goes back in the box.\r\n\r\nYou decide.\r\n\r\nBetter scans are here:\r\n[URL=\"http://s856.photobucket.com/user/thromdog/library/Available?sort=3&page=1\"]http://s856.photobucket.com/user/thromdog/library/Available?sort=3&page=1[/URL]\r\n\r\nAlso will entertain $$ offers.\r\n\r\nFew things I want to note on the cards themselves\r\n1. Dubuc is one of the most difficult EPDG's to find so I will want a premium\r\n2. Joss SGC 10 has a pinhole in his hat\r\n3. Jones SGC 10 has an pressed seal (into the card) around his head.  It's actually pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=207663&d=1444506132[/IMG]\r\n[URL=http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=207664&d=]Attachment 207664[/URL]\r\n[URL=http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=207665&d=]Attachment 207665[/URL]",
