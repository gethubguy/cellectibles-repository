They will answer the phone and take the time to address your needs.  Note that whenever you submit around known shows, you can expect that your order will take a few days longer.  I believe that the Philly Show and Chantilly may have affected your order... but again, I would call to ask about it.",

While I fully get that they will sometimes have time constraints, I can't imagine it should take all that long to grade a card that is clearly a 10.\r\n\r\nWhile I am under no serious deadline to have the card back, I certainly paid a bit extra just so they weren't sitting on it forever. Apparently, that didn't help. \r\n\r\nCan't say I'm all that thrilled considering this is my first-ever experience.",
