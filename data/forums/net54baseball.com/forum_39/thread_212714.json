I will discuss straight sales, though trading for other rare backs would be my preference.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you feel you may have a match please write to me and I will be happy to chit chat.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n\r\nPS\r\n\r\nI can include cash in a deal if necessary and I do have a few other nice cards which are not pictured, should things get really frisky ...",
