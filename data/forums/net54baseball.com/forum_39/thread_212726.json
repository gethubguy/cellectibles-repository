      "post_content": "I would like to hang in my office some T206s in my office in a frame that holds cards with holders.  I need about 20 or so cards.  Dont need any particular player but centering is key.   Looking to spend $30-$150 a card.  Some of the in action poses are cool and portraits too.  Maybe cool names work too.   Can buy raw too but costs of grading factor into the price.  Basically looking at cards like i used to look for my women, cheap and pretty\r\n\r\nJust looking for a conversation piece..\r\n\r\nlooking for uniformity now...just green background   or  blue sky/green bottom...2 color backgrounds\r\n\r\nno creases but back damage is fine if raw or lower than psa 3",
