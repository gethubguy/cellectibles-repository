I'm also looking for oddities, such as stamped-backs, and to diversify my back collection; so, if you're interested in trading, let me know what you have. I prefer ungraded cards. \r\n\r\n*Note on Scans: As the page is turned, the backs are in reverse order. \r\nAlso, the cards are in two protective plastics, a halved penny-sleeve--which creates the appearance of a vertical line on each card--and a pocket-page:",
