      "post_content": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm looking to add one of the bigger cards to my 150-350 subset.  Figured I would try dangling this one as trade bait.\n\nLooking for these cards in GD or better.  Some of these are worth more than the Matty.  I have cash and a ton of other stuff to trade if you have one of those cards that you could part with:\n\nA lot (but not all) of my other trade stuff can be found here:\n[url]http://stores.ebay.com/lukesvintagecards[/url]\n\nBender portrait Old Mill (maybe EPDG)\nCrawford throwing Old Mill\nElberfeld NY Hindu\nElberfeld Wash\nJohnson port Sov150 or EPDG (+cash obviously)\nKeeler with bat EPDG or Old Mill (maybe Sov150)\nLajoie portrait Sov150 or Old Mill (or Hindu +cash from me)\nMatty portrait Sov150 or Old Mill (+ cash from me)\nMatty white cap Sov150 or Old Mill (+cash from me)\nMcGraw portrait no cap Hindu or Old Mill\nPelty Hindu\nTinker portrait Hindu, EPDG, or Old Mill\nTinker hands on knees Hindu or Old Mill\nYoung bare hand Sov150 or Old Mill\n\nI'd also be interested in a stack of crease-free commons that I need with EPDG or Sov150 backs (or maybe a Hindu or 2 depending on which players)",
