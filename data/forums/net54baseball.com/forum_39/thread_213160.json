The discussion can be found on this thread [url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=210363[/url].  I don't know if they are a part of the puzzle of an uncut sheet, but they don't fit in my collection.  None the less, they are good looking cards with no creases.  I'm looking to get what I paid for them.  $45 each - paypal gift or add 3%.",
