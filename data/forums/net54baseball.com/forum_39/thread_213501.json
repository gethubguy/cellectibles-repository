And the Pirate may be impossible. \r\n\r\nBut you have some amazing cards already. A yellow/brown scrap? And a T213 Factory 8 overprint? And some great T206s. I wish I could help. Good luck.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a Gabby Street back-run. I'm still missing the Red Hindu, Lenox, and Piedmont 42. Also the Red Cross. Maybe in a few years we can scan our cards together, Walter and his catcher.   :)",

So I'm not worrying myself with finding those.  :)\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nSteve",
