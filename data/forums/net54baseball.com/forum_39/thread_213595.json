      "post_content": "Both of these have just a sliver of the name above, but are still pretty cool cards.  The Griffith is hard to price.  The Old Mill back is really tough to find.  Mine is the only one I've seen come up for sale in the last 3 years.  The SGC and PSA pop reports combine for 8 known graded copies.\r\n\r\nShoot me any questions via PM or email ( [url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url] )\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nGriffith - Chase Old Mill $250\r\n\r\nChase-Jacklitsch P350 $125",
