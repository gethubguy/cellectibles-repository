Yes, I just picked this up from a poor listing (IMHO) off eBay for cheap.  Yes, I am looking to make a little profit to put towards a monster I am angling for.  If this quick sale is distasteful to you, please don't buy it.  I am still listing it for a good deal below what VCP was before I bought it.\r\n\r\nI have made a few deals on here, some for good size, have 600+ positive feedbacks on eBay with no negatives.\r\n\r\nFirst to post gets it.  Please also message me just to be safe.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\n-PP",
