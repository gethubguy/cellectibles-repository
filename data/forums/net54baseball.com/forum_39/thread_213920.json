      "post_content": "Don't know why it received the A. SGC didn't provide a reason for the grade when they returned it to me. Probably for being trimmed, maybe across the top edge, but it does measure okay 1 7/16 by 2 5/8. Its a well-centered card so would display very well in a raw collection.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nJoe",
