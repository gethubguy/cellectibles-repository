This card has almost every flaw imaginable, BUT if you need a Demmitt STL to fill a spot in your collection, this one is priced right.\r\n\r\n$500 NET to me via paypal includes shipping in the US.   Price is firm.  No trades.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img222_zps0293803e.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img223_zpse133fa8d.jpg[/IMG]",
