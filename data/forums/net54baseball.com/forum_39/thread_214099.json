I have upgraded my Sweet Caporal 350/460 Factory 25, so this Vic Willis card is available. \r\n\r\nThe SC 350/460 Fac 25 is ranked 19 (out of 38) and is more scarce than Cycle 350, Tolstoi or EPDG backs.\r\n\r\nIt was a SGC 20 before I set it free.\r\n\r\n$35 includes shipping between cardboard, in bubble envelope with tracking.\r\nPP FF.\r\n\r\nPM any questions or comments. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-Jimmy\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s326.photobucket.com/user/xplainer2010/media/2015-11-14%201a%20001_zpsk7zyjssv.jpg.html][IMG]http://i326.photobucket.com/albums/k407/xplainer2010/2015-11-14%201a%20001_zpsk7zyjssv.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s326.photobucket.com/user/xplainer2010/media/2015-11-14%201a%20002_zpsaxv97bvv.jpg.html][IMG]http://i326.photobucket.com/albums/k407/xplainer2010/2015-11-14%201a%20002_zpsaxv97bvv.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
