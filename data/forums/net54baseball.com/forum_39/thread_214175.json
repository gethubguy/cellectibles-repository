I'd consider both of these to be Poor condition but are in reasonable shape.\r\n\r\nI tried attaching images several times, but keep receiving an error message.

When I took them with my camera, it was set to the default/highest image quality, so they're like several 7-8 MB each. Even compressed that only took it down to about half. \r\n\r\nTo all - I'm away from my scanner right now, but a few people have requested scans. Should they still be available by later today, I will scan them in here.",
