      "post_content": "Conner is still working on his Pirates T206 set.  This year he has asked for Vic Willis.  He has Clarke, Camnitz, arms folded and hand over head, and pitching Deacon Phillipe, Maddox, and Abstein.  \r\n\r\nHe has targeted Willis for Christmas this year, but if anyone has any of the remaining Pirates in the 2-3.5 range, I will look at those.  I probably won't get him more than a couple, but I am always eager to help with his pre-war bug.\r\n\r\nThanks",
