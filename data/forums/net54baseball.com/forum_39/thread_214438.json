Of course if the difference in cards requires some cash, then we can talk.  \r\n\r\nThis front back/combo seems to be lower in population - PSA 6 & SGC 4\r\n\r\nGreat looking card - thought it would grade for higher but there is a little mark on Joe's knuckle.  It looks like a divot - also some slight wrinkle marks in the shoulder area.",
