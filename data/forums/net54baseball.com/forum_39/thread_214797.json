      "post_content": "These have been sold pending payment.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of (61) T206s for sale here  - no duplicates are included. These are all pretty low-grade - some worse than others. Some are beaters and others are more reasonable. Flaws can include creasing, stains, pinholes, paper loss, tears, trimmed, etc. Some are presentable but make no mistake, these are lower-end type cards.\r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted a nice head start on a T206 set, this is it.\r\n\r\nI am NOT selling these individually right now and I'm just looking to unload them all at once. If they do not sell as a group, I would break them up but for now, these are being sold as one lot.\r\n\r\nHighlights include:\r\nMarquard throwing (Sweet Cap overstrike Factory 42)\r\nBender Polar Bear throwing no trees (Polar Bear) - card is in decent shape with no major creasing or major paper loss but has pinhole\r\nWalsh (trimmed)\r\nRockenfeld Southern Leaguer\r\nWestlake Southern Leaguer\r\nBirmingham Horizontal\r\nPattee Horizontal\r\n\r\nAlso included are:\r\nAbbott (SOVEREIGN)\r\nAmes hands up\r\nAnderson\r\nArmbruster\r\nArndt\r\nAtz\r\nBarry\r\nBell throwing\r\nBerger (POLAR BEAR)\r\nBlackburne\r\nBradley\r\nBrashear\r\nBridwell no cap\r\nBurchell\r\nBurke\r\nButler\r\nChappelle\r\nConroy bat (POLAR BEAR)\r\nConroy glove\r\nDonlin bat (POLAR BEAR)\r\nDorner\r\nEgan\r\nElberfeld fielding (POLAR BEAR)\r\nFromme (SOVEREIGN)\r\nGraham throwing\r\nHerzog\r\nHoffman\r\nDavy Jones\r\nFielder Jones\r\nLumley\r\nManning bat\r\nMcGann\r\nMcGinley\r\nMcQuillan\r\nMerkle portrait\r\nMoriarty glove (SOVEREIGN)\r\nNicholls\r\nOldring\r\nPelty vertical\r\nPhelan\r\nPickering\r\nRaymond\r\nRhoades\r\nRitchey\r\nScott\r\nSharpe\r\nSlagle\r\nStovall (SOVEREIGN)\r\nStreet glove (POLAR BEAR)\r\nTenney\r\nWilhelm ball\r\nWilhelm bat\r\nWillett bat\r\nIrv Young\r\n\r\nSome of the commons are a little harder to find. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the Bescher card shown is NOT part of this lot. In addition, only 59 cards (other than Bescher are sold). The other two didn't fit in the scans (Wilhelm ball and Willett bat) but are included. Both are Piedmonts, Wilhelm is trimmed and Willett is missing a corner. Both have clean backs.\r\n\r\nMost backs are fairly common ones, but about 1/5 are tougher backs. In all, there are four Sovereign, six Polar Bear, one Sweet Caporal overprint.\r\n\r\nNOW ASKING $$OLD PENDING PAYMENT (net to me via Paypal) for these - that includes shipping, tracking, and insurance. This is a good way to bang out more than 1/10 of the set all at once and again, there are no duplicates here. Please feel free to PM any questions.\r\n\r\nI have scanned these in but please feel free to inquire about individual cards.\r\n\r\nThanks -",
