      "post_content": "Hello - I am new to the board.  This card was purchased by me from Pete Gustafson (he can verify) last October.  Believe Pete is a member here.  I just reached out to him a few days ago to see if he knew of anyone interested since this was a unique item.  Unfortunately due to a death in the family I am trying to unload a few items to help my mother in law which is the only reason I am selling.  Asking $1400 but will consider all offers.  Also have this listed on ebay and have great feedback on there if you prefer the safety of the bay.  Thanks for looking.",
