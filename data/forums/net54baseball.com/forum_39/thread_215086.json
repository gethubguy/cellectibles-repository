      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nI need to sell a decent amount of stuff to pay for some recent purchases.  I won't need to sell anywhere near all of this stuff, but I'm willing to move these cards if we can make a deal.  \r\n\r\nI know nobody like the \"make an offer\" BST posts.  I have a few cards here that are probably better suited to an auction setting, but I am throwing them up for offers just in case someone wants them enough to make a strong offer.  The scrap market can be all over the place, so I will listen to all offers.  If I get a few offers, I'll probably take a few days to decide what to do.  I will likely consult some knowledgeable friends about the offers, but I will not use your offer to try and get someone else to go higher.  I am motivated to sell, but this is certainly not a fire sale.\r\n\r\nI can accept most payment types.  PP f/f is easiest for me, regular PP +3% is fine.  Checks and MO also fine.\r\n\r\nRoughly in order of value:\r\n\r\nShaw Piedmont 350 PSA 5.5 $2,800 obo Probably the highest graded copy, but no way to be sure.  Also the most beautiful T206 I've ever owned.  Almost flawless.  (forgot to scan this one at first, so it is the first scan on the second page)\r\n\r\nHunter scrap $1050 obo  Hand-cut and missing color pass(es)\r\n\r\nKrause scrap $900 obo  Hand-cut and missing color pass(es)\r\n\r\nLeifield scrap $700 obo  Hand-cut but colors look normal\r\n\r\nChance yellow portrait Cycle 460 SGC 35 taking offers  Hard to figure out a price on this one.  A very nice SGC 40 went for $3,286 at auction last year.  I don't expect anywhere near that, but it makes it hard to put a value on mine.
