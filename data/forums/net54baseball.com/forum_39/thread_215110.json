Any form of payment accepted.  \r\n\r\nAlthough PMs will be read and responded to, I very much prefer email at: [url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nYou can also email me for better scans, questions, comments, suggestions, etc.\r\n\r\nA few things, so I can keep this as organized as possible:\r\n\r\n1 -- I will address all correspondences in the order of date/time delivery into my email box (including PMs).\r\n2 -- Please Note:  I work evenings/nights, and keep somewhat odd hours. Therefore response time may vary depending when I am on the computer. However, all correspondences will be addressed.\r\n3 -- \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d will take precedent over ongoing correspondences.\r\n4 \u2013  Satisfaction guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWay to many to list on a thread.  Easiest thing to do is an ebay link (sg713):\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/sch/sg713/m.html?item=141848123790&ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&_mPrRngCbx=1&_sop=15&_trksid=p2046732.m1684.l5985[/url]\r\n\r\nAny card listed at $20.90 or less may be had for $17 / card.\r\n\r\nWhich is pretty nice, imo :rolleyes:, and really can't do better.\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott",
