It's a Sheckard with a Brown portrait wst on the back; got the name, team, and the red ink from the background of the Brown portrait.  That's actually part of the Brown portrait still stuck to the upper right corner (I peeled an edge up and peeked at the color underneath).  So if you've got a Mordecai Brown portrait card that's missing a chunk of its upper left corner, I have the rest of your card!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://imgur.com/uGq50H5.jpg[/IMG]",
