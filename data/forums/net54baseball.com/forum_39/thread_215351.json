The next day when I couldn't remember where I stuck my Johnson the night before I was so scared.  I can't tell you the relief I felt when I learned I had at least put it in a protective sleeve and put it in the same nice and cozy space it had been so many times before.  That could have been a very costly mistake.  Years later me and my Johnson are still together but I'm very careful where I put him now.  Let this be a lesson to you all.",
