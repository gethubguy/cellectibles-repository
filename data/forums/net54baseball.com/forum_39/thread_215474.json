      "post_content": "Greetings, all -\r\n\r\nSix T206s here for sale as I'm looking for a little extra cash and these are just sitting around.\r\n\r\nThebo (Southern Leaguer)\r\nBescher\r\nSchaefer (Polar Bear)\r\nAbstein\r\nLake No Ball/Follow Through\r\nSchlei Batting\r\n\r\nThese are pretty low-grade condition. The Bescher, however, is in nice shape and is crease-free. It does have some very minor chipping in two small areas as well as a light print line of sorts, but is in very nice condition. The Lake is considerably better than the others with only one significant crease.\r\n\r\nThese mostly have significant creasing, but do not appear trimmed and the only ink is some faint letters on the back of the Thebo.\r\n\r\nThe Abstein is a slightly difficult common from what I've seen. I paid about $85.00 + shipping for these and will ask $OLD delivered for them just because I want to move them quickly. At this time, only selling these as a group.\r\n\r\nScans may not be the greatest so if you have any other condition questions, please ask.",
