The image is nice though giving the appearance of a higher grade from the front.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10035/brown-m-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSimilarly Joe resides in a BVG 1 slab with some of the same maladies.  Like Mordecai though the image is compatible with a much higher grade.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/18733/tinker-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThese cards would display very nicely in Cub wall display.  If you are a front collector looking for aesthetically pleasing HOF portraits, this listing is for you.\r\n\r\nI am asking $66 each for these cards including shipping, or $130 for the pair.\r\n\r\nAll payments are net to me by any means available to you, but I will not return the pigeon if that is your choice.  If you want them cracked out of the slabs, I will offer that service at no additional charge.",
