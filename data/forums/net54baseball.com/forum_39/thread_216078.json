I saw it listed and didn't say anything at first because I didn't want to interfere with a sale. Then he asked \"Is my price in line?\" and then that's when I gave my opinion, although I never quoted a price. If he asked, I'd say his price now is more in line with what they are worth. While cool, it technically is a damaged card, not factory made that way. Brian/Jobu sold one for $40 and that was listed for awhile before he sold it. You can see the link above.",
