      "post_content": "I've been holding this one for a while; graded 55 which is very nice with a partial double name.  But the big \"deal\" on this card is the (very faint) cylinder impression of Quillen (reversed) on the back of the card.  I've attached scans of front and back, and then a second scan with some manipulation to make the image stand out more.\n\nEvery few days I will knock the price down roughly 10% by updating my last post and title.  I will only bump this once a week.  We may get to a point where I'm not willing to go any lower and the auction will end.  PM me with inquiries.\n\n[STRIKE]Offering on 1/4 at a price of $350.[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Offering on 1/6 at a price of $320.[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Offering on 1/9 at a price of $290.[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Offering on 1/12 at a price of $260.[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]Offering on 1/14 at a price of $235.[/STRIKE]\nOffering on 1/17 at a price of $200.",
