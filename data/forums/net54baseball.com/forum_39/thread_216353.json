      "post_content": "Up for grabs is a Hindu Persons, Southern League graded SGC 20.  Nice card for the grade, presents well no paper loss.  Creases and rounding corners are the defects.  Asking $180 SOLD\n\nAlso:\n Eddie Collins Piedmont back.  Very nice looking card, great colors.  I have some 3's that don't look this good.  My best guess is that will grade out at 2.5. Asking $90  SOLD\n\nVic Willis Throwing Polar Bear Back.  This one is a solid 2 grade.  Good condition one light crease in the bottom left corner and one heavier in the right corner (looks better in person that in scan) along with rounding corners.  Still has good color especially the back.  Asking $45 SOLD\n\nJoe Birmingham Sweet Cap.  Low end SGC 20.  Creasing, rounded corners dirt on it.  Asking $18 SOLD Considering it cost $10 to grade not a bad deal \n\n\nPlease include $2 to ship.  Paypal F/F only.  Will probably ship to ebay if they don't sell today.",
