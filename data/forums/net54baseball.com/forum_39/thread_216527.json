In other words, get these off my desk !!!!\r\n\r\nAll cards have some sort of issue and/or affliction, but have nice images.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the randomness in scanning order.  These are a conglomeration :rolleyes: of cards from many lots, and a pain to put together.  Front and back scans do align.\r\n\r\n**** See Below Post ***\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott\r\n\r\nAside:  Tony and Doug, some sweet cards at great prices.  Surprised all aren't sold by now :confused:.   \r\nIf I weren't a \"bit\" low in card funds (and a \"tad\" concerned with stock market :( ) I'd be all over them.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=217686&d=1452640708[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=217687&d=1452640951[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=217688&d=1452640989[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=217691&d=1452641024[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=217692&d=1452641056[/IMG]",
