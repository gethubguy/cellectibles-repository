      "post_content": "Forgot I still have this card.  Price reduced 3 years later...\n\nPrice is $250 or best offer.  How can you put a price on such a rare and unique card?  This is your chance to be the care taker of the infamous \"sh*tty Nodgrass\", a card that was once owned by some kid with a pencil as well as once resided in the back pocket of some guy.  Don't let this chance slip by.  Price includes a brown paper bag to put over your head in case you feel the need to look at the card while sober. :)\n\n[IMG]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x16/sylbry/Mobile%20Uploads/20160113_184303-1_zpszwqhlhg6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x16/sylbry/Mobile%20Uploads/20160113_184314-1_zps4ryflf6m.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x16/sylbry/Mobile%20Uploads/20160113_184248-1_zpsxqqaai8j.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x16/sylbry/Mobile%20Uploads/Screenshot_2016-01-13-18-49-27_zpsnlwaryil.png[/IMG]",
