Six cards are offered at a variety of odd prices which include shipping.\r\nAll prices are net to me, but use any form of payment you can handle.  I don't make change.\r\n\r\n#1 - Whitey Alperman with a Sovereign 150 reverse in good condition and an SGC 30 holder for $OLD.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10605/alperman-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#2 - Steve Evans with a Polar Bear reverse in excellent but ungraded condition for $OLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/28928/evans-pb[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#3 - Hal Chase Dark Cap (the William Tell variation) with an arrow piercing his Apple Sovereign 350 reverse in ungraded condition (but it's not EX) for $45.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/23250/chase-dark-cap-app-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#4 - Harry Krause Pitching with a Piedmont 350 reverse in VG+ condition in an SGC 45 holder for $43.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10265/krause-pitching[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#5 - Dots Miller with a Sweet Caporal 350 reverse in VG condition in a PSA 3 holder for $41.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10479/miller-d[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#6 - Jim Pastorius with a Piedmont 150 reverse in Good+ condition in an SGC 35 holder for $OLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/22265/pastorius[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIf the odd pricing bothers you, buy two and I'll guarantee you an even price.;)\r\n\r\nGranted, admitting you want one of these cards could be harmful to your reputation, so just shoot me a PM.
