No Sweet Caporal, Piedmont, Polar Bear. I may have to throw in a couple bucks as most likely I'd be looking for the following backs:\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty, Sovereign, Old Mill, Tolstoi, EPDG, maybe Cycle\r\n\r\nThe T215 and T206 are not for sale, please send scans of possible trades of Cobbs to [url]madolfi1968@yahoo.com[/url]",
