      "post_content": "Here's the new deal. \n\nI did not pay more for any these nine cards than I am asking.  \n\nTo get this thread moving, if you are interested in any three of the nine cards,  send me a PM with the three names via PM.  I will then give you a price for the three cards equal to what I paid for them plus $5 to cover the shipping.  At that point you have no obligation to buy them, but I will also not entertain counter offers.  Just give me a yes or no on the price.  \n\nIf I receive a second inquiry including a card with a pending offer, you will have to wait until the first triple play is turned down, before I will send you the price for your triple play.\n\nIf an inquiry is received containing three cards not in play, I will give you a price immediately (I do sleep on occasion though).\n\nOn thread I will update the first post to indicate if an offer is pending and when a sale has been completed.\n\nSo in summary,\n\nYou must buy three cards.\n\nI, the seller, will make the low-ball offer to you the buyer.\n\nYou give me a yeah or nay, with no obligation to buy whatsoever.\n\nTry out the system even if you don't want the cards.\n\nThat's it.",
