      "post_content": "3/2 - Majority of the pricing has been reduced further\n\nOne more shot at selling these fantastic, colorful cards.  Mount them in a scrapbook using photo mounts and no one will ever know of their clipped corner.\n\nDiscount for larger purchases:\n\n$75 to $199     -10%\n$200 or more   -15%\n\nBuy 3 or more cards - free shipping\n\nA great looking group of T206 cards, all with the obvious clipped bottom left corner.  These cards all came from a near complete set auctioned off a few years ago that all had this similar cut corner.  The majority are crease free and extremely colorful with crisp borders. \n\nFlaws beside corner issues will be noted, just in case not obvious in scans.  Shipping will be $3.00 for either 1 or 2 cards, and free for purchases of three cards or more.  See above chart for discounts for larger purchases.  A commitment to purchase locks in these cards.\n\nBrian\n\n\nFirst group of scans:\n\nAbbott  $16 (paper chip)\nArmbruster  $19\nAtz  $18 \nBarry  $18 (corner crease) - SOLD\nBrashear  $19\nBurke  $15 (creases)\nCarr  $13 (multiple wrinkles)\nCasey  $13 (paper chipping, back staining)\nCongalton  $18\nDelehanty  $19 - SOLD\nDorner  $19\nDowns  $14 (paper chips, corner crease) - SOLD\nDygert  $13 (creases)\n\nSecond group of scans:\n\nFlanagan  $14 (creases)\nHall  $19 (creases)\nHinchman  $18\nHoffman  $16 (crease)\nHowell  $19\nJones-Detroit  $13 (creases) - SOLD\nKillian  $19\nKruger  $19\nMalarkey  $19\nMattern  $19\nMcGinley  $21 - SOLD\nMcGlynn  $17 (wrinkles) - SOLD\nMcIntyre  $21\n\nThird group of scans:\n\nMilligan  $17 (crease, mark on back)\nMoeller  $19\nMoran  $19 - SOLD\nPerring  $19\nPhelan  $21 - SOLD\nRandall  $13 (creases)\nRhodes  $21\nRudolph  $19\nSchmidt  $19 (wrinkle)\nSharpe  $16 (wrinkle)\nStreet  $18 (crease)\nWeimer  $21\nWright  $19\n\nFourth group of scans shown in post #3 (newly added 2/9):\n\nBurns  $21\nCarrigan  $21\nMoran  $21 - SOLD\nMurphy  - SOLD (to myself...one of my best customers)\nO'Hara  $21\nRucker  $21\nAbstein  $19\nBerger  $19\nDoolan  $19\nBliss  $19\nEngle  $19 - SOLD\nGaspar  $19\nGraham  $19\nKroh  $19\nQuinn  $19\nThomas  $19\n\nFifth group of scans shown in post #3 (newly added 2/9):\n\nWhite  $19\nCree  $18\nEasterly  $18 - SOLD\nGray  $18\nHoblitzell  $18\nKnabe  $18 - SOLD\nLennox  $18\nMcElveen  $18\nPurtell  $18 (slight creasing top border)\nRhoades  $18 - SOLD\nSnodgrass  $18 - SOLD\nCampbell  $17\nEgan  $17 (corner crease)\nHofman  $17\nHunter  $17 (wrinkle)\nLivingstone  $17 (corner crease) - SOLD\n\nSixth group of scans shown in post #3 (newly added 2/9):\n\nOakes  $17 (minor crease)\nWarhop  $17 (corner crease)\n\nunless noted, all of below have a certain amount of more moderate creasing - pricing reflects severity:\n\nFerguson  $15\nHulswitt  $15 - SOLD\nMcCormick  $15\nPfeister  $15\nUnglaub  $15\nByrne  $13\nFletcher  $13\nScott  $13\nStahl  $13 (no creasing, missing small pieces upper right corner) - SOLD\nStarr  $12\nSweeney  $12",
