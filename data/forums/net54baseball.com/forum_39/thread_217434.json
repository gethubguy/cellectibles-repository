Take a look below and decide which option you prefer.  These prices are within the U.S. only.\n\n$3 - regular secure shipping in a bubble mailer with tracking\n\n$1 - secure shipping with cardboard in regular envelope.  This method does not include tracking.  I will give you my word once I have put it in the mailbox, but I can't track it after that.  This shipping option is at your own risk.  If you trust me and the PO, this method might be best for you.\n\n$15 each:\nBerger  SOLD\nHerzog  SOLD\nBescher  SOLD\nRitchey SC 150/25\nDunn Sov350\nWiltse  SOLD\nOwen SC150/25\nLattimore\nCasey Sov350\nSchreck\n\n$20 each:\nNeedham  SOLD\nChappelle SC\nParent\nQuillen Old Mill\nSheckard double factory SC 649\nChappelle P350\nMcIntyre Sov350\nDooin Sov350  SOLD\nI.
