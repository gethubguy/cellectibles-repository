      "post_content": "EDIT:  Turns out I am also missing the Sweet Caporal 150 Factory 25 back and Soverign 150 backs as well! Argh!\n\nSo looking for Dode Criss with OM, SC 150 (25) and SOV 150 backs.  Please let me know if you come across any or have one you are willing to part with.  Thanks!\n\n\nBased on suggestions/information from members here, I started my T206 collection by going after a Dode Criss back run.  Why Dode Criss?  Well he and I share a birthday (and thankfully not a birth year). Hey, gotta start somewhere, right?\n\nSeriously though, after reading about him I really got on board with collecting a back run.  Although a pitcher by trade, he is credited with being the first regularly used pinch hitter and in 1908, narrowly missed winning the batting title (then commissioner Bob Johnson awarded the title to Ty Cobb).\n\nAnywho, I've enjoyed hunting down the more common backs and I am now down to 1 (confirmed) back - Old Mill.\n\nSo if you have one you'd be willing to part with, or see one in your travels, I sure would love to hear about it.\n\nThanks!
