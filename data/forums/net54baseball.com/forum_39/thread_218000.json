      "post_content": "Card looks like an 8 other than what appears to be a tiny bit of paper loss on the E of the word cigarette. The bottom left of the back of the card is fine, that white spot was apparently a bit of lint on the card holder when I took the pic (you can actually see the shadow of it on the card). I have looked at the card under a magnifying glass, and I don't see positively paper loss on the letter E, it is just too small to say. Evidently PSA felt it was, thus the grade. This is an extremely strong card with razor sharp corners. $450 delivered, thanks...",
