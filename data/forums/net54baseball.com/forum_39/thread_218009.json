If you don't like the price, make me an offer!\r\n\r\nContinuing to upgrade the set and get rid of dupes.\r\n\r\nPrices listed include shipping.  I'm always willing to listen to offers, but anyone saying \"I'll take it\" gets preference.  Payment via PP F&F is preferred.\r\n\r\nMy scanner doesn't do well with graded, especially SGC cards. I can take a picture and email it to you if you prefer.\r\n\r\nTrade offers welcomed!  If you have something, it may be an upgrade for me, so I'm all ears.  If you have any EPDG's or oversized cards, those work for me too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$SOLD Bill Graham PSA 1.5\r\n$SOLD Bill Lattimore SGC 30\r\n$SOLD Glenn Liebhardt SGC 30\r\n$SOLD Fred Burchell SGC A but nice \r\n$SOLD Gabby Street Portrait PSA 2(MK) \r\n$SOLD Dode Paskert PSA 2\r\n$SOLD Paddy Livingston SGC 55 \r\n$SOLD Fred Jacklitsch PSA 2.5\r\n$SOLD Steamer Flanagan PSA 3\r\n$SOLD Frank Isbell PSA 3 \r\n$SOLD Admiral Schlei SGC 40\r\n$SOLD Otto Kruger SGC 40\r\n$SOLD Fred Payne SGC 40 \r\n$SOLD Paddy Livingstone SGC 40\r\n$SOLD Bob Rhoades hands at chest SGC 40\r\n$SOLD Tom Guiheen PSA 2 Old Mill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=221572&d=1455678061[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=221573&d=1455678069[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=221915&d=1455984350[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=221916&d=1455984356[/IMG]",
