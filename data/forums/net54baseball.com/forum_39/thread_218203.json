Note that asking for a lower price of larger scans will not reserve the card for you. First \"I'll take it\" will take it. Check or money order only. NO PAYPAL. Visit my updated website below. Many prices lowered. Thank you for looking.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.monkberry.com/~edhans/t206you.jpg[/IMG]",
