      "post_content": "Price well below it's purchase price of 5 years ago......$1500 will now buy this terrific card!!!\n\n1909-11 Hindu (Brown) T206 Cy Young Portrait SGC Auth, terrific card with the rarer Brown Hindu back, graded accurately for rear surface wear. Front presents vg-ex with no creases or wrinkles, strong color and perfect focus. Back shows small peel removing the 'I' and 'N' from Hindu, most likely from removal from a scrap book. Interestingly, this card also has a stamp to the back, seemingly placed there by an early owner......I'm unable to be confident in the script but would make a good who dunnit for the next owner! \nSorry about the lack of focus from my scanner, card has crisp registration focus.\n\nThis card last sold in 2011 Goodwins Auctions for $1655\n$1500 price includes fully insured delivery. Payment by paypal preferred\n\n[IMG]http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad12/flinchfree/sports%20cards%20and%20memorabilia/1909-11%20T206%20Hindu%20Cy%20Young%20Portrait%20SGC%20Auth_zpshhumkmgi.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad12/flinchfree/sports%20cards%20and%20memorabilia/1909-11%20T206%20Hindu%20Cy%20Young%20Portrait%20back%20SGC%20Auth_zps6nfmbgle.jpg[/IMG]",

Here is the link:  [url]http://www.goodwinandco.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=17214[/url]\r\n\r\nIt resided in a PSA 1 (MK) holder, which I crossed over to SGC. All my prewar are in SGC holders. SGC felt the rear paper pull too significant to give anything other than an Auth, which I agree with, however should you wish to cross it back to PSA I believe you would be successful.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad12/flinchfree/sports%20cards%20and%20memorabilia/T206%20Hindu%20Cy%20Young%20PSA1%20MK_zpskvrwatig.jpeg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad12/flinchfree/sports%20cards%20and%20memorabilia/T206%20Hindu%20Cy%20Young%20PSA1%20MK%20back_zpswwusrxwe.jpeg[/IMG]",
