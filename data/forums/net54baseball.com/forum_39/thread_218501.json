Post #66:\n\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=118253&highlight=oddities[/url]\n\nThere is a pink Chase with a crop mark on the back, but I don't think there is a blue Chase with one. Outside of the scrap Chris mentioned (I think there are two of those, Chris can correct me there), the only oddities I have seen are back stamps like the triple-stamped card I have:\n\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/132359235@N05/18353256094/in/album-72157654788552062/[/url]\n\nAnother possibility is to look for varying shades of blue, some are darker/lighter than others. This will be tough bc you will have to trust scans.\n\nGood luck in your hunt, please post anything you find, I would love to see them.",
