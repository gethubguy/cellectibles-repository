      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T206 cards for sale or trade. These are mostly low to mid-grade cards as the scans will show. Even the lower grade cards in the group, for the most part, have nice eye appeal for the technical grade. Only a few beaters in this lot! \n\nPlease add $2 shipping for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Payment via any method you prefer. Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\n\nCARDS PICTURED (removing **SOLD** cards for easier viewing):\n\nStahl (arms at side, card on right) - $16",
