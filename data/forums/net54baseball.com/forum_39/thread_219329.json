I don't really know what the market is for a card like this, but if I can add a tough-ish back or two to my collection, I would trade it.\r\n\r\nLooking for all the Old Mill backs that I need, as well as American Beauty, Cycle, Hindu, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and if you have any info about past sales or trades of Burdick's T206s that you'd like to share, please shoot me a PM.\r\n\r\nLuke",
