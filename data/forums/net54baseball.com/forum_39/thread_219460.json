OC to bottom, some weird surface or ink imperfection on his face, clean bold back.\r\n\r\nBresnahan has a couple of creases that don't show well in the scan.  One diagonally at top left corner, the other horizontal starting left edge near smoke stack ending 1/2 way thru arm.  OC to right, wear to corners, light soiling on back.\r\n\r\nRob\r\n:)",
