However, there are multiple creases - about 5 main ones.  One diagonally at upper right, a second starting at right edge going horizontally towards his mouth, another that extends from the right edge thru his shoulder and tot he left edge, a 4th smaller one just below that, and a 5th that is faint but starts on the right edge just above his hand and runs down to the lower left edge.  Piedmont 350/25 back has glue paperloss on all four corners.  Paper is slightly wrinkly in the \"350 Subjects\" area.  A nice low grade example with good eye appeal.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRob\r\n:)",
