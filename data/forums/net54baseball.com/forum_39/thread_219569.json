Graded is preferred, but open to a raw card as long as it is guaranteed to receive a full grade e.g. not just authentic.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=587&pictureid=18970[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPM or email, [url]shernan30@gmail.com[/url], if you have any interest in trading.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, \r\n\r\nSteven",
