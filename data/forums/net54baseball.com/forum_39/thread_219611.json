Sorry, it went fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow Forum Participants:\r\n\r\nI have a young lady starting college in the fall, so I am forced to liquidate some of my collection to help with tuition costs.\r\n\r\nI am listing a T206 Carl Lundgren (Rare Chicago variation) graded a PSA VG-EX 4 (MC) - Piedmont 150 Factory 25 card.  The card is beautiful as you can see by the scans.  The corners are beautiful in comparison to most other T206 cards.  There looks like there are three to four very tiny ink specks on the top right border near the corner.  I do not detect any creases or surface wrinkles.  There appears to be an ever so light color discoloration on the reverse of the card at the \"The Cigarette of Quality\" location - looks a tan color slightly darker than the card stock.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s7.photobucket.com/user/Clark7781/media/Lundgren%20CUBS%20FRONT.jpg.html][IMG]http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y283/Clark7781/Lundgren%20CUBS%20FRONT.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s7.photobucket.com/user/Clark7781/media/Lundgren%20CUBS%20Back.jpg.html][IMG]http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y283/Clark7781/Lundgren%20CUBS%20Back.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nI'm looking for $400.00 for the card via Paypal Gift.  Shipping with insurance is $12.00 sent in a priority USPS box with insurance.  Please give me a three day handling time from the time funds are cleared from my account.  Please feel free to ask any questions; I will respond as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaul",
