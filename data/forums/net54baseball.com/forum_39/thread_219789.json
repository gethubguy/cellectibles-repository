I am looking to buy just the following Detroit Tigers, lower or even altered condition being not only fine, but in fact optimal:\r\n\r\nO'Leary port\r\nWilletts pitching\r\nMullin/Mullen port\r\nCobb green (yeah right, I know)\r\n\r\nBacks unimportant, though I can appreciate a rare back as much as the next guy.  Please let me know if you can help,\r\n\r\nRichard",
