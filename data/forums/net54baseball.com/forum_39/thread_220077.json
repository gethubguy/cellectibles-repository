Card is cross listed on eBay too.\r\n\r\nAs for trades, will definitely listen.  Love me some EPDG's, especially ones I don't have.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=225460&d=1458925516[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=225461&d=1458925524[/IMG]",
