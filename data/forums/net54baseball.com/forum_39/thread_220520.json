Not sure what SGC was looking at, I can't find any issues front or back. A PSA 5 just sold for around $5K a couple of weeks ago. I'm looking for a fair price applicable to the card , if not I am going to submit it to PSA....Thanks, **SOLD**",

I'm sure SGC saw something thus the grade. Having said that, I have collected cards for 25 years and I don't see anything. This is a card where to some degree, you buy the card and not the holder.  If it doesn't bring a fair price in my eyes, I will submit it to PSA. Not really sure these are topics for the BST though anyway....",

Other boards are different and if someone doesn't list a price on a card, they get their head ripped off by the mob.  On this board, you can list whichever method you choose.  Great to share an opinion, but may want to get a little more experience in before doing that\n\nAdded: Great looking card Kevin.  Good luck with the sale",
