      "post_content": "Looking to celebrate some.  Almost 3 years after starting, I've got my 520, so now I want to focus on diversification.....haha.  \r\n\r\nWanting to acquire Dahlen Brooklyn with a Sovereign, Old Mill, And SweetCap fact 25 back.  Not worried about condition too much.\r\n\r\nAlso looking for a Dahlen Boston EPDG and of course the Piedmont 350.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, looking for any EPDGs I don't have.  Not looking for high grade.  You can reference my collage below to see what I have. Easier than typing......\r\n\r\nI have some Dahlen Brooklyns available for trade as well as an Elberfeld.  I also have a bunch of Dahlen Bostons available for trade....mostly low grade but do have a PSA 4 that looks nice.\r\n\r\nAlso have a really tough Thielmann American Beauty that's an SGC 20.  I think there are 2 total on both pops, so gonna be tough to find another.\r\n\r\nWould entertain offers on anything too, but would like to trade. Will also cash out any differences of course.\r\n\r\nThe Elberfeld has paper addition on the back. I typically don't soak cards, but this one might be worth it.......\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=226531&d=1459698213[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=226532&d=1459698228[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=226534&d=1459699018[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=226539&d=1459699588[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/t206/total2.jpg[/IMG]",
