Because u know people will see the glue and ask about it anyway or that u know people view glue on the reverse as a lesser flaw than a crease on the front.   I think it's deceptive to reveal one flaw and not the other when u r trying to get more than the usual value for a graded card.   Either simply offer the card as a 2 or give full descriptive disclosure.  Id be pissed if I paid a premium for this card then received it with an additional flaw than expected.",
