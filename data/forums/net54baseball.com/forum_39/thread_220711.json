      "post_content": "Fairly affordable card of the 'Stashe.  It is miscut a little to the top (and has extra space at the bottom) but sizes properly. As you can see, the card has a great image and no creases. There is considerable back damage from being pasted in an album, but for a low grade card it is very presentable. The part of the scrapbook that is still adhered may soak off, but I never worried about it. $75 shipped via paypal f&F. Check would also be fine.",
