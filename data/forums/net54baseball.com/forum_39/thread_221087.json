Jones (Portrait)\r\nKnight Bat\r\nMalarkey\r\nMcGlynn\r\nMcIntyre (hands up)\r\nNeedham\r\nSchaefer (hands on knees)\r\nSchulte Back\r\nShaw\r\nSullivan\r\nHeinie Wagner (both)\r\n\r\nNot looking for anything graded, just presentable Fair or Good condition in the $15-$20 range. Will pay a little more for non-common backs like PB or Sovereign if decent shape.\r\n\r\nAlso still looking for beaters/low-grade commons in the $10-$12 range for my second set. Only have about 60 of those so need almost everyone.",
