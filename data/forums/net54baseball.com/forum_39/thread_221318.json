Awesome little piece of art of a very popular card, with a nice back too. I am working on another deal to purchase this card in similar format, so I am no longer in need of this one.\nCard is in poor condition but looks great in person - looks like it would grade out as \"Authentic\" or maybe a 1. It has some creases, retains some round corners, has a few marks above his head (looks possibly like dirt or old ink.) $45 delivered (add 2.54 for s+h) , PP f+f, takes this home today in a nice bubble mailer. \nI can provide additional scans if needed.\n\nCard will ship safely in a nice case and in a bubble mailer, will send via First Class mail.\nIf you have any questions please ask!",

Hoping that one goes through, but if not there are plenty of fish in the sea. I'm sure I'll have many more opportunities to pick one up :)\r\n-NJ",
