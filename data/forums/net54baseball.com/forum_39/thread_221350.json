      "post_content": "Here are 4 very nice PSA 2 with great color and clean fronts. All are crease-free and are marked down by glue residue or staining or tape residue. As you can see they display much nicer than the given grade. That's my thing collecting cards that look nicer than the given grade. I have decided however, that I will focus only on portraits, hall of fame and other rare cards in the set so I am going to let these and several others go.\r\n\r\n33.00 delivered through paypal for each.\r\n\r\nHunter \r\nDoolan Fielding \r\nHoffman\r\nDonohue",
