Obviously condition will be low, but I would like the card to be intact on the front- back paper loss is totally fine.\n\nIf this doesnt work, no worries, but please no bashing me for my prices. If you would like to sell some at this price, awesome! If not, that is totally understandable!\n\nThanks!\n\nEd",
