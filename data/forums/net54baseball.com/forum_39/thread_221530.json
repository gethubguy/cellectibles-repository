      "post_content": "I have a few listed on ebay. All have the \"Best Offer\" options. Include that you are a member here with your offer. I will sell WELL below listed price for Net54 Members. I'm sure we can work out a deal, if you need them. Use the ebay 'zoom\" feature to check them out closely.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All deals will go through Ebay. Not open to off site offers. If you are in Canada, let me know and I'll disable the Global Shipping option. I understand that is very expensive for the buyer.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n-Jimmy\r\n\r\nHere is the Titus link.
