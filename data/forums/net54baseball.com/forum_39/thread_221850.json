      "post_content": "Selling this t206 Fred Clarke Portrait. PSA 2. Great edges, and would probably have been graded much higher if it werent for the paper loss on back. \r\n\r\nHaven't been on here in awhile, so I am a little rusty on the market value, but from what I remember, $115 is a fair price. Willing to negotiate though.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[IMG][URL=http://s1277.photobucket.com/user/Drazz5/media/DA87C799-9E21-44D8-B7D8-525097538EF3_zpstfidbeud.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y500/Drazz5/DA87C799-9E21-44D8-B7D8-525097538EF3_zpstfidbeud.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\r\n[IMG][URL=http://s1277.photobucket.com/user/Drazz5/media/image2_zpscqg88wjj.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y500/Drazz5/image2_zpscqg88wjj.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]",
