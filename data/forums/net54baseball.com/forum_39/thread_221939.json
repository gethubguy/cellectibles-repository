      "post_content": "Hello. I am interested in trading for a copy of the Cy Young glove shows with a Piedmont factory 42 back.\r\n\r\nFor trade, I have an attractive Ty Cobb red portrait with the Piedmont 42 back. Despite the low technical grade, it is my opinion that the card presents very nicely, with a strong image and a gorgeous advertising reverse. Unfortunately, there is some light paper loss around parts of the white border, which do not effect the image. Where the paper loss is most relevant is on the \"C\" and the second \"B\" in \"Cobb\", but otherwise the card is very strong.\r\n\r\nI you have a match and have any interest in discussing a potential trade please free to shoot me a PM.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\nDerek",
