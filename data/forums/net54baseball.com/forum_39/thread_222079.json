      "post_content": "Offered for sale is a very special PSA AUT T206 scrap card with 6-7 different print runs on the back. The front has Bernhard, Nashville with the back having Piedmont, El Principe(2 strikes, one upside down), a BROWN Old Mill, Germany Schaeffer Fielding, a yellow ink pass which appears to be the correct overlay for Schaeffer and perhaps part of another yellow print run. This is a sheetmate to the card sold in Heritage's 2015 Leon Luckey Auction. As far is known these are the only two cards found with this multi-strike, and anecdotal evidence obtained from both provenance's indicate they were in fact in the possession of the same individual about 25-30 years ago. This one, just now coming into the hobby again. \n\n\nMAY 14, 2019. The person that purchased this card has decided to sell it. I am offering it here on NET54 first before going anywhere else. I do have the card in hand. NO LONGER AVAILABLE\n\nA chance to obtain an extremely rare print anomaly.\n\n\nScott\n\nEdited to add a link to the Heritage card for comparison\n\n[url]http://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball/-the-1909-11-t206-mullaney-southern-league-overprint-back-with-cy-young-and-old-mill-brown-/a/7116-79004.s?ic4=GalleryView-Thumbnail-071515[/url]",
