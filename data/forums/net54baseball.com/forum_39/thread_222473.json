My seller account is the same handle.....thromdog.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for below, looking to sell these or trade them for upgrades or EPDGs. Let me know what you got.  As always, I will entertain offers, especially if buying a couple.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any EPDG's that I don't have please let me know. My collage of current EPDG's I own is below, so if you don't see it in there.....I need it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it\" takes precedence over negotiations.
