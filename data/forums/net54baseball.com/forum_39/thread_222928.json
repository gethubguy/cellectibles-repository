      "post_content": "Just got these back from PSA.  Brand new cases, no scratches.  I sent them in expecting 3s and up, and in most cases 3.5s and up.  These are the ones that graded lower, but still have the eye appeal of a higher graded card.\n\nThese scans came out smaller than I had intended.  Please let me know if you'd like a larger scan of any of the cards.  I can add it to the thread or send it to you via email.\n\nShipping for 1 or 2 cards is $3.00\nPlease add $1 for each additional card after the first two.\n\nPaypal goods only please\n\nCF=Crease-free\n\nPSA 2:\nBransfield $35 sold (has some really faint blue markings on back which I didn't notice until now)\nMcLean $34 sold\nO'Hara CF $34 sold\nPerring $32\n\nPSA 2.5:\nGrimshaw CF $38\nSheckard CF $38  sold\n\nPSA 3:\nAbbaticchio $42\nAbbott CF $46 \nBurchell CF $44\nCross CF $44  sold\nDoolan $46\nDorner CF $44  sold\nGaspar CF $44\nJacklitsch $42  sold\nLake CF $49\nLaporte CF $42\nMerritt CF $49 (extremely strong card, sharp corners)\nSchirm CF $42  sold\nSpencer SC 150/25 $55 sold\nThomas CF $46 (partial name at top)",
