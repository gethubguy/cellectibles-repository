      "post_content": "Hey everyone! I am hoping to pick up some portraits from here on Net54. Lower condition/ungraded/SGC graded preferred but will look at PSA, BVG as well. Any back is fine :) I will bump this each time I have cash available for 3-5 cards at a time. There are quite a few here, and as a young man saving for college, I don't have the kind of money to buy them all in one stroke :D However, that doesn't mean I won't be interested if you piece together a small lot for me. Main interests are in the following order: SLers, HOFers, Commons...but I would be happy to look at any of the cards listed. Please let me know if you have a few!\nEmail: [url]njdunkin1@gmail.com[/url]\nCurrent budget: +/- 95.00\nREFERENCE:\n(x): identifies that I already possess said card.\n(ix): card is incoming and has been recently purchased\n(!): high on the want list\n(!!!): highest on the want list :)\n\nHere we go!\n\n  Abbott, Fred  \n  Abstein, Bill  \n(!)
