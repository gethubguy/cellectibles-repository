      "post_content": "Awesome, unique card.  Has a bit of paper loss on the reverse that luckily doesn't obscure much text.\r\n\r\n$3,200 shipped and insured via USPS Registered Mail.\r\n\r\nI've done a ton of transactions here, but never one this big.  If you'd like to buy but are wary of the doing such a large transaction, I'm sure we can find a suitable escrow.\r\n\r\nHigh res scans available to anyone with serious interest in buying.   Just shoot me a PM with your email address.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
