      "post_content": "For sale is a Dave Brain with a multi-strike back and multi-print front. It is labeled only as a Multi Strike as that was all SGC would do at the time. This may be a step below the Bernhard just sold but with the multi-print front it is quite unique. At this time I am fielding offers but no trades. \r\n\r\nFeel free to send me a PM or Email for more information.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam",
