      "post_content": "Listening to offers on this T206 Old Mill Gandil. An almost impossible card to find, Gandil was apart of the \"Exclusive 12\" and for whatever reason, his card, along with the other 11 subjects, are very rarely found with the Old Mill Back. I have included some links to previous posts regarding the difficulty of the Old Mill Gandil and the Exclusive 12. This is only the second confirmed example graded by SGC, and Gandil's toughest back to find in the T206 set. Listening to offers. PM or email me at [url]eppersmatt@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions or offers. \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?p=1433365[/url]\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=194236&highlight=exclusive+12[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=233232&d=1464726182[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=233233&d=1464726190[/IMG]",
