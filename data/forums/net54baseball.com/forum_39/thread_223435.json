      "post_content": "I've always posted a price with everything I've sold on the boards before but this is a first. I don't have a value on this one.\nI have an unusual Titus with a color shift/ghost image.\nIt appears that the color is off from the black lines giving him way off shoulder collar and hat outlines and a nice double mustache! Nice abnormality of a popular card.\nOpen to offers. \nI would be open to trade offers, too. Looking for E90-1, and pose collector of Shean fielding, Larry Doyle throwing and (not holding breath) Dots Miller fielding.\nThanks!\n[IMG]http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160602/5efa655d35d45417146108adb6052363.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160602/8268e9428bf89f1825a9b666db102470.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160602/f9a2247b194b5201cdb595cef0b92b81.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N910A using Tapatalk",
