      "post_content": "Hello, Card Fans.  That title sounds like I am selling a card that I do not have, but au contraire.  I have had the card for several years and although it is not in hand at this moment (I am typing), it could be.  I am listing the Herzog BOS SGC 40 card now for $55 shipped.  If the card is purchased, in the next 5 hours, it will be shipped today, but I will be traveling until Thursday this week, so I am prepared to offer a special \"delayed shipping\" discounted price after 5 hours of $49 and the card will be shipped on Thursday.  That is over 10% off.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/16279/herzog-bos[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe Herzog BOS card is more desirable in my opinion than the Herzog NY card and carries a slight premium.  This example features excellent color and registration and is nearly centered for you middle of the roaders.\r\n\r\nNail it down now and ask for the Delayed Shipping Special.  Why wait 5 hours?:D",
