      "post_content": "Wood coated with a oil mixture that brings out the deep grain found in Ash. Corners are dovetailed for strength, box holds 80 slabs at a 30 degree so the label is viable. \n\n Has a russo lid support that holds the lid open. \n\nThis was a custom box made for a member on another forum, but I took too long so he backed out and I don't blame him at all.. I'm slow at this Have a full time job as well. The inner rails are removable. I have 3 of these boxes stacked in my safe.  Asking 180.00 Shipped OBO , but really want to trade for T-206 George Brown Chicago, Tom Needham Ed Reulbuch w/glove , Jimmy Sheckard no glove. Heine Zimmerman. Cards need to be PSA 4-5. Thanks Darrell\n\n[URL=http://s535.photobucket.com/user/deltaarnet/media/105_0100_zpsez2qziai.jpg.html][IMG]http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee358/deltaarnet/105_0100_zpsez2qziai.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s535.photobucket.com/user/deltaarnet/media/105_0101_zpsv6eldq1w.jpg.html][IMG]http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee358/deltaarnet/105_0101_zpsv6eldq1w.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s535.photobucket.com/user/deltaarnet/media/105_0102_zpsf1j7s2uf.jpg.html][IMG]http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee358/deltaarnet/105_0102_zpsf1j7s2uf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s535.photobucket.com/user/deltaarnet/media/105_0103_zpsyfp7a15l.jpg.html][IMG]http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee358/deltaarnet/105_0103_zpsyfp7a15l.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://s535.photobucket.com/user/deltaarnet/media/105_0105_zpsnou1od0o.jpg.html][IMG]http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee358/deltaarnet/105_0105_zpsnou1od0o.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",

I know the dimensions are slightly different vs PSA but it looks like there may a little bit of extra width. Not sure about height and how the depth may alter the angle you have allowed for. Love how the angled display allows the labels to be seen. Nice work!",
