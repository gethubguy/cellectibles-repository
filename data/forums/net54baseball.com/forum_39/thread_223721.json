Why it did not receive a numerical grade is a complete mystery to me and others who have seen it.  I was expecting a decent grade and re-submission of this card I feel is a viable option.  Or if you are an ungraded collector this card this would be a handsome HOFer for your collection.  it is a beautifully centered card with great color.\r\n\r\nAnd it's gone.",
