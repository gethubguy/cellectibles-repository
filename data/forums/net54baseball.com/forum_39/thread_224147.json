      "post_content": "Long time lurker, and finally getting an itch to buy some vintage baseball. Im looking for any Ed Abbaticchio cards (Even as far back as 1902) I can get on here. Looking for any graded SGC or PSA cards only. Unfortunately I do not pay paypal gift, so please take that into consideration when setting a price. Im as legit as they come, easy to deal with, and hope to find some good peeps on here as I expect to be active from now on. This is long overdue, but im very excited to get going on a nice vintage collection! [url]salsgoods@live.ca[/url] is my email, so shoot me an email, or send me a message on here. (Whatever you prefer). I prefer to pay less than ebay, and I prefer to have all cards shipped to my COMC US address to save us both on time and money. Thanks alot!\r\n\r\n\r\nSal",
