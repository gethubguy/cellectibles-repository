But if someone says I'll take it, that gets precedence.  Sorry on rough scans for the SGC cards.\r\n\r\nPPF&F only please.  Buyer pays $2 shipping for 1 or 2 cards. 3 or more and shipping on me.\r\n\r\n$19 Doolan Fielding SGC 20\r\n$34 Dorner SGC 40\r\n$38 Paskert PSA 3\r\n$12 Casey\r\n$26 Merkle Throwing \r\n$55 Campbell EPDG.
