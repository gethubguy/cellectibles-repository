      "post_content": "Have decided I need to refocus my collecting and have a few extras to bargain with.\n\nI would sell (so i will list a price) but probably prefer to trade if possible.  I'm especially interested in \"trading down\", so this might be a great opportunity for someone to \"upgrade\" from a few cards to one or two.\n\nI can send additional pictures if interested, for space I'm only going to show fronts for now and list the back type.\n\nOne more thing, I do think I'm going to be in AC for the National Wednesday-Friday, so if someone was interested in settling up there that could probably be arranged.  Just let me know.\n\nE90-1 Cy Young PSA 3 - $1,800\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5243.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Cy Young SGC 55 Polar Bear - $1,750\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5241.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Christy Mathewson PSA 6 White Cap Piedmont 350 - $4,250\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5247.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Walter Johnson PSA 4 Piedmont 350 (this one is PWCC High End Certified) - $1,850\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5249.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Walter Johnson PSA 3 Sweet Cap 150 - $1,300\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5252.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Nap Lajoie SGC 55 Piedmont 150 - $750\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5254.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Roger Bresnahan PSA 5.5 Piedmont 350 - $600 (would really like to trade down to a 4 on this one)\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5256.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 John McGraw PSA 4 Piedmont 350-460 - $275\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5258.jpg[/IMG]\n\nT206 Bobby Wallace PSA 4 Piedmont 150 - $225\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k602/davidratliff4/0%20-%20BST/IMG_5260.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPM or email to [url]david@davidratliff.com[/url]\n\nThanks for looking",

      "post_content": "If trading, these are the only ones I would consider for now.\r\n\r\nThey need to be well centered and mostly crease free.  I don't mind rounded corners though, which is why PSA 3s or better could work.  And while I prefer PSA, I would consider equivalent SGC.  I'm not particular about backs, rare or otherwise.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'm looking for:\r\nTy Cobb green portrait\r\nTy Cobb bat off\r\nTy Cobb bat on\r\nWalter Johnson portrait - PSA 4 or better\r\nChristy Mathewson portrait\r\nTris Speaker\r\nJohn McGraw portrait\r\nEddie Collins portrait\r\nWillie Keeler portrait\r\nFred Clarke portrait\r\nJimmy Collins portrait\r\nHugh Duffy\r\nHughie Jennings portrait\r\nFrank Chance portrait (red or yellow)\r\nJack Chesbro portrait\r\nJohnny Evers portrait\r\nClark Griffith portrait\r\nJoe Mcginnity  portrait\r\nJoe Tinker portrait\r\nRube Waddell portrait\r\nEd Walsh portrait",
