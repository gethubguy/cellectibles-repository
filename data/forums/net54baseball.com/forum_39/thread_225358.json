      "post_content": "I took a liking to the Ed Abbaticchio blue sleeves T-206 card for a while and even though I'd like to keep these, I could use the extra funds to help buy some other T205s and T207s I need for my sets.\r\n\r\nPlease note the backs are in reverse order as the fronts shown above them. Included are some nicer backs including two Polar Bears and two Sweet Caporal Factory 42 Overprints. Other backs include five Piedmont 350-460 Factory 25s and one unknown Sweet Caporal.\r\n\r\nThese are at the lower end of the scale with some creasing and various flaws but other than the one with the Sweet Caporal back with paper loss, not completely abused. I would mostly grade these Poor to Good. One of the overprints is in very nice condition without creasing. It just has a light 'line' imprint and a smidgen of paper loss on the back on one of the 'E's in 'Sweet'.\r\n\r\nAsking SOLD via PPFF for the lot. These do pretty well on eBay with common-back graded 2s usually selling in the $35-$40 range per card. Feel free to ask any other condition questions as the scans may not be great.",
