      "post_content": "*** SOLD ***\r\n\r\nUp for sale here are some T206 triples I've had for a while. As you can see, these are lower-grade - some very low grade.\r\n\r\nMost are common backs but there are two Polar Bears here. The Snodgrass is even a pretty nice low grade card IMO with only some creasing.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson looks to be in great shape. However, I was told when I bought it that it was believed to be trimmed. It measures up well with the rest of these but as such, please keep that in mind. It is not an obvious trim as I have seen before but I am selling under that assumption since the previous owner believed it to be trimmed. Very high eye appeal on that one.\r\n\r\nIncluded are:\r\n\r\nBarbeau - Sweet Cap 350\r\nBell Follow Through - Piedmont 350-460\r\nBrain - POLAR BEAR\r\nDavidson - Piedmont 350\r\nGasper - Piedmont 350\r\nJackson - Sweet Cap 350\r\nMcGlynn - Sweet Cap 350\r\nOldring - Piedmont\r\nRhoades Arms at Chest - Piedmont\r\nSchlei Batting - Piedmont 350-460\r\nSnodgrass Catching NY - POLAR BEAR\r\nWiltse Throwing - Sweet Cap 350\r\n\r\nPrice is SOLD delivered for the lot, which comes out to a little more than xx per card with free shipping. At this time, I'm not interested in selling individually. If you have any specific questions about condition, feel free to shoot me a message.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
