I just replaced these with rarer backs so they were in my original set which I had already been upgrading. All have some creasing although the Gasper is more like some 'wrinkling' at the bottom. Oldring also has a pin hole and O'Leary measures short.\r\n\r\nNo writing, significant paper loss, etc. McIntyre is NOT trimmed - diamond cut.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email with any questions regarding specific condition to any one of the cards.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
