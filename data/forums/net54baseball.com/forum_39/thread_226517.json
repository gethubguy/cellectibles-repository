      "post_content": "Hello, all you fellow T206 traders !!!!!!!\r\n\r\nLooking to do some possible deals with SLs.\r\n\r\nOf my 48, I have 38 OMSL and 1 Hindu.  That leaves me with 9 Pied. 350s.\r\n\r\nI would like to trade my Pied. 350s for OMSLs (possibly Hindu).\r\n\r\nKind of have a wide variety of conditions :rolleyes:.  Therefore, some I could go down a bit, or some go up a bit.  Corresponding added cash as necessary :).  Raw is what I do, but graded is fine, although I can't see going over a 3.\r\n\r\nHere's my list:\r\n\r\nBastian \u2013 g/vg\r\nBay \u2013 f\r\nCranston \u2013 ex (probable trim)\r\nHart, Little Rock \u2013 f/g\r\nHickman \u2013 vg+ (fleck paper loss on back)\r\nMullaney \u2013 g\r\nPersons \u2013 g\r\nShaughnessy \u2013 f/g (cool \u201credemption\u201d stamp on back, may be good enough for me)\r\nViolat \u2013 g\r\n\r\nIf you have any OMSLs, let me know.  I can get scans off to you, and go from there.\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott\r\n\r\n(Would consider straight out purchase, but seeing what lower end SLs are going for, would keep it under $75)",

SC649, my Pied. 350 is available.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=242426&d=1471895730[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIt's a good image with obvious condition issues, and would be an easy sell.  But what fun would that be ????  I'd rather trade it for some of the above needed SLs.  Some cash could be added one way or the other.\r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nSpeaking of SC649s, sitting now at 30/34, only need:\r\n\r\nBates -- vg+ (with ink on back)\r\nGilbert -- vg+ (solid card)\r\nMcIntyre/Brk. -- g/vg\r\nSchlei/catch -- vg/ex (beautiful extra dark coloring)\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.  Of course, love to trade for them, condition indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFun, Fun, Scott :rolleyes:",
