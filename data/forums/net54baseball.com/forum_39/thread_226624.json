      "post_content": "SOLD.  is a T206 OLD MILL Ty Cobb Red Portrait SGC 60. Currently the highest graded in the SGC pop, but there are higher ones in the PSA pop (FYI). \n\nPro's: Incredibly bold red color, great focus on Cobb, white borders, clean back and corners that look better (IMO) than a traditional SGC 60. \n\nCon's: A little off center right to left and the faintest hint of wet transfer on the right side. My scanner runs hot, so attaching phone pics as well. \n\nSOLD $4200 Delivered. Currently not seeking lower offers. Prefer check or money order (not PP as I don't plan on buying anything soon.) \n\nThanks for looking. PM or email [url]samuelswartz@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nPositive transactions with: jantz, kell75, MR RAREBACK, griffon512",
