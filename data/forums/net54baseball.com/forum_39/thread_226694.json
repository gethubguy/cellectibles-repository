      "post_content": "Yes that's right.  I have 5 of them and I'm selling them as a lot for $35 delivered.  They are beaters that's for sure. All of them have significant flaws including paper loss (on back) hole/extremely heavy crease and/or even a piece of the card missing ... But each card is at least 75% complete (most are a bit better).  Hey what do you expect for $7 ?!\r\n\r\nPlease don't ask me for scans ... However, if you're genuinely unhappy I will accept returns for your money back.  \r\n\r\nEmail [url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
