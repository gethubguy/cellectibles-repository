      "post_content": "Hi guys, I'm looking to sell some of my tough to semi-tough backs. I have researched the population reports so you don't have to. The populations listed are for TOTAL population by PSA and SGC for that particular front/back combo.  They are displayed in parenthesis, the first one is PSA, the second is SGC (PSA)(SGC). Some of these are really tough, as the pop. report will show. I accept  PayPal, checks, and Money Order.  Prices are net to me, so please add 3%  for regular PayPal.  Please add $2.50 for shipping, free shipping on  orders of $150 or more, to include insurance.
