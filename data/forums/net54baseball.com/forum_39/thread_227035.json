One of the nicest raw sets that you will find.\r\n\r\nThis set is very consistently vg/ex - ex and is probably 10% ex/mt or better including a small handful of NM cards.  No bad cards...except for Young Portrait (tape stain).\r\n\r\nSerious inquiries only please....\r\n\r\nemail to [url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
