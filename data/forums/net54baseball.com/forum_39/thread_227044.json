In full disclosure, I don't believe that the description was accurate as more extensive restoration was done than was indicated in the auction.  I'm attaching a link to the very extensive discussion about this card ... and T206 Plank cards in general... so that any buyer has full info\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.network54.com/Forum/153652/thread/1206459400/1/T206+PSA+PLANK+Just+listed+for+sale[/url]!\r\n\r\nNonetheless it's an authentic T206 plank and some prefer that to buying a '1' that looks it was shot, killed and lovingly placed in a holder.\r\n\r\n[url]http://may09.hugginsandscott.com/cgi-bin/showitem.pl?itemid=12192[/url]",
