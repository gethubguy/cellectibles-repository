Have done many, many great deals and trades with many members that fit my needs:\r\n\r\nCollect raw, but graded is fine.  Looking for fair to good, with nice images and clean backs.  Basic lower grade flaws, creasing, worn corners, etc. are acceptable.  Really nothing above a PSA3 range.  \r\n\r\nHave some stuff to trade.\r\n\r\nSee other post for OMSL needs, please.\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott (.... and I can still quit anytime I want :rolleyes:)",
