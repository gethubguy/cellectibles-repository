I used to own nice looking Matty and Young portraits but have since parted with them like a putz. I am fine with pretty much anything so long as it is not a real \"beater\".\r\n\r\nI have the below cards and money as needed to make deals. If you have a match please feel free to pm me or write me at [url]info@t206society.com[/url] and I will send you scans of whatever interests you.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n\r\nEddie Collins ...
