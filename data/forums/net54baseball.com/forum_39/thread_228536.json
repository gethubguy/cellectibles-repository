Therefore, it's not a PSA 4 but a vg with tiny pinhole!        $315 delivered\n\nMathewson , white cap.....piedmont 150 Now this could REALLY be a 4 except half the name on the bottom is missing due to miscut.  otherwise really nice card....$ 315.00 deliveredSOLD\n\nMATTY WHITE IS SOLD--DEL HOWARD POLAR BEAR (vg ) IS AVAILABLE , HOWEVER\n\nbill latzko",
