      "post_content": "I have these two cards available for sale or trade. The Joss with a Polar Bear is not rare but still has only half the examples of a card with a Sweet Caporal or Piedmont back. The McGinnity with a Polar Bear is a bit tougher with only 21 cards on the PSA pop report and none over a 4. There are 12 times more McGinnity's with Piedmont backs. On the Joss 240.00 . McGinnity 150.00 . I am also open to trades on other hall of famers of similar value.",
