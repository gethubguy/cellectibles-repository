      "post_content": "Offered for sale is a double name version of George Davis HOF with Piedmont 350 reverse.  Admittedly the name at the top is partial but is undeniably Just \"George\" as well.  The eye appeal of this \"Fair\" card exceeds the technical grade in my opinion.    This is the same card that is listed on T206Insider.com, where additional offerings are available.  Check it out.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10061/davis-g[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPay anyway you care to with funds net to me.  Shipping is included in $60 asking price, now slashed to $48.  Feel free to make an offer as well.  Willing to haggle and dicker.",
