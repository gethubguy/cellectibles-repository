      "post_content": "T206resource.com has this as unconfirmed.  There is one in the PSA pop reports, so that makes at least 2.  The back of this one is a mess, but it does seem to be a tough combo, and I figured maybe someone would like it for a master set or back run.\r\n\r\nI got this card in a group of 80 SC 350s.  About 20 of them were 150-350 series subjects with SC 350/25 backs like this one.  It's not pretty, but it is legit.\r\n\r\n$75 shipped for Pastorius.  The 5 other cards are not part of this sale.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
