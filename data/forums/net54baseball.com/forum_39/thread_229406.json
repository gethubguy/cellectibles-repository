      "post_content": "Shipping is $3\r\n\r\nThese are a group of cool print errors and some cards that I think are especially nice for the grade or significant in some other way.\r\n\r\nMeyers \"four eyes\" portrait $92 - Check out the second set of eyes in black on his forehead.  Card is in great shape.  Has some blue pen markings.\r\n\r\nMeyers bat with floating black outline $82 - Cool looking registration shift and the card is in great shape.  Has a tough back to boot.\r\n\r\nSpencer with 3 noses and 2 mouths $55 SOLD - Not in as nice of shape as the other 2, but does have the cool SC 649 back.\r\n\r\nEvers portrait with 4 eyes $169 - Wild registration error.  Check out the second set of eyes and the black moustache.  The card is actually in pretty nice shape despite the low grade.\r\n\r\nMarshall PSA 4.5 $92 - Bought this one a couple years back as part of a group intending to sell it, but when I got it in hand, the red background was so beautiful I kept it.  You kind of have to see it in person to fully appreciate it, but the red background is so bright it appears to sparkle.\r\n\r\nDoyle SGC 45 $69 - Tough to find this \"150 only\" series card in nice shape, and this one just has incredible eye appeal.\r\n\r\nMalarkey Sov350 $69 - Really nice for the grade.  No creases and bold blue background.\r\n\r\nWiltse Sov460 with huge borders $89 - Probably the tallest t206 I have ever owned.\r\n\r\nShipke SGC 35 with huge top border $59 - Cool card that was almost certainly situated at the top of a sheet.\r\n\r\nChase with trophy PSA 2 $70 - Just a really strong card for the grade.  Rounded corners and a tiny 1cm wrinkle on the left edge.",
