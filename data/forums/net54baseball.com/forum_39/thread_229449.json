I'd like to help out those set builders out there.  Nearly 200 available.  \r\n\r\nCards are priced below.  Accepting offers.  More cards = more of a deal. :)\r\n\r\nBuy 5 or more, get 10% off.\r\nBuy 10 or more, get 15% off.\r\nBuy 20 or more, get 20% off.\r\n\r\nShipping for less than 10 cards will be $3.  Free shipping on 10+.\r\nPM please.\r\nPP F&F or add 3%.\r\n\r\nFor prices and pictures:\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://t206.weebly.com\"]LINK #1[/URL] \r\n\r\nThese are priced for individual sale (higher value ones):\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/jp1216/for-sale-or-trade\"]LINK #2[/URL]\r\n\r\nFor those that requested - Here is a link to a Excel spreadsheet of the remaining cards.
