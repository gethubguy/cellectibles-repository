I do this when I fulfill sportlots.com orders and random shipments that I need to make. Hope this helps. But if anyone know directly about the Friends/Family, please chime in.",

Their UI right now is terrible IMO. Anyway ... I guess if I can't figure it out when I'm ready to ship via FF then I'll do like cammb and walk to my PO to ship/track :-) Thanks again for the feedback!",
