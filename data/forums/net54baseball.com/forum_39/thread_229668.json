      "post_content": "With great regret, I offer this t206 Christy Mathewson (Black Hat Version).  I acquired it in the mid-1970's and it's been part of my personal collection since then, but it's time to simplify.\r\n\r\nPrice:  us$375 with free shipping.  PM if interested.\r\n \r\nIt has not been graded but in my personal/non-professional estimate it would conservatively rate as EX  (see photos).  The corners are somewhat rounded and the right front and top left corners have some \"peel-back\".  It looks like there's a crease in the upper left front corner but there isn't- must be an issue with the photo. \r\n\r\nI wanted to offer it here to folks I know will appreciate it before taking it to eBay (my eBay ID is \"lutherr\" if you want to check me out- 100% positive feedback).  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need to see more images.",
