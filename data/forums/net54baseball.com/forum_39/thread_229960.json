Happy to follow links if you have your cards listed elsewhere. \n\nThanks for looking and please let me know if you have something that meets this criteria!\n\nFYI, I haven't done a transaction on Net54 yet, but have 260+, all positive feedback on eBay under the same username. \n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
