Hoping for reasonably well centered cards with no creases or wrinkles.  Still need Old Mill, Hindu, Sovereign 150, Piedmont 350, and both Sweet Caporal Factory 25 (150 & 350).  Send me an email and LMK what you have and what you're asking price is.  I also have several cards for trade including some Old Judges.  Thanks,\r\n\r\nEric\r\nEangyal @ roadrunner.com",
