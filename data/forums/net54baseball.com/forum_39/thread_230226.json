PLEASE PM if interested, and please refrain for asking for a price in any post afterwards.\r\nIntention to replace these with PSA versions. Trades are open as well.\r\n\r\nThe RED Cobb is in 'raw' and is a double name top/bottom  Polar Bear  \r\nThis card was purchase the exact same way it is currently. I have had a pleasure talking with a forum member, and it does seem it will grade, but may have troublesome corner, which may result in a slabbed 'alt' or 'authentic.\r\nAnother member says it might get a 1.5MC -2MC thru PSA. \r\nUpdated new picture, to perhaps zooms in on the card better. \r\n\r\n*Pending Payment*--SOLD\r\nThe GREEN Cobb is a BVG 'alt'  Sovereign and its has great eye appeal of a good looking 3-4 perhaps. \r\n\r\nAgain, these cards have never been sent to grade, I have been informed in my best interest to sell these both cards and just buy PSA versions for the registry\r\nPictures are below.",
