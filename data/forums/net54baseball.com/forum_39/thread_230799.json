      "post_content": "I have for sale a beautiful SGC 20 that appears at first glance to be a solid SGC 50. No creases or surface wrinkles with deep gorgeous blue with no spotting or fading. SGC gave this a SGC 20 for the back of the card which you would typically think paper loss but not on this one. Appears some one wanted to remember when they got the card as the stamp reads \" May 8th , 1910 \" which I think just adds to the history of the card.\r\n\r\nAsking $350 - First come first serve on this one. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/svtPONY95/pre-war/24937/t206-tris-speaker-piedmont-[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/svtPONY95/pre-war-backs/24938/t206-tris-speaker-piedmont-[/IMG]",
