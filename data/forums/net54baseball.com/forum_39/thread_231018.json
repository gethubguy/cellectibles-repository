The monster is winning, but I'm not done yet, just going in a different direction against the ugly beast. Here is the list of what I have:\n\nI removed the cards that sold from the list.\n\nPaskert with Dec 22 1912 stamp $25\nLavender with Lloyd Bolton stamp $25\nMilan with May 31 stamp $30\nNichols with May 8 1910 stamp $25\nRandall with R.B.S stamp $25\nF. Smith with a stamp $25\n\nTake the whole 6 card lot for $130\n\nWill discount multiple purchases. \n\nShipping is free and would like a PayPal gift to [url]lisajoe97@yahoo.com[/url] for payment.\n\nSorry for the small pics. Send me your email and I will get your better ones. Thanks\nJoe",
