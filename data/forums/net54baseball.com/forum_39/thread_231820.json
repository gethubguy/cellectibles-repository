Cards have various flaws including marks, paper loss, trimming, creases, etc.\n\nPayPal Friends and Family please.\n\nPrices include shipping and insurance.\n\nMinimum of 3 cards purchased per lot please...at least until the lot widdles down.\n\nPrices are firm at this time.\n\nI will process requests as they are received, so please be patient with my response to requests for cards.\n\nCards are listed in the order they appear in the scans. Note that the back scans are reverse order of the front scans (flipped the pages over while scanning).",
