Any form of payment accepted.  \r\n\r\nAlthough PMs will be read and responded to, I very much prefer email at: [url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nYou can also email me for better scans, questions, comments, suggestions, etc.\r\n\r\nA few things, so I can keep this as organized as possible:\r\n\r\n1 -- I will address all correspondences in the order of date/time delivery into my email box (including PMs).\r\n2 -- Please Note:  I work evenings/nights, and keep somewhat odd hours. Therefore response time may vary depending when I am on the computer. However, all correspondences will be addressed.\r\n3 -- \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d will take precedent over ongoing correspondences.\r\n4 \u2013  Satisfaction guaranteed.\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nI have 50 commons up on ebay (sg713) that are listed at BIN $19.91 (Plus $2 s/h).\r\n\r\nBut, as an T206 \"enabler\" :) I will set \"net54 price\" at:\r\n\r\n1 card -- 19, delivered.\r\n3 or more cards -- 18, delivered. \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/sch/sg713/m.html?item=371806097816&ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&rt=nc&_mPrRngCbx=1&_udlo=19.90&_udhi=19.91[/url]\r\n\r\n:( Darn link shows all cards.  You can best get to the 19.91 ones by filtering \"lowest first.\"  BUT, if anything else catches your eye, we probably can work something out. ;)\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott",
