Trades for the same cards only.\r\n\r\nIf any of these are upgrades for you, let's talk. Thanks\r\n\r\nThe cards below remain available:\r\n\r\nZach Wheat SGC authentic\r\nRoger Bresnahan with bat SGC authentic \r\nArt Fromme SGC 10\r\nSteve Evans SGC 10\r\nBill Burns (barely visible but there, comma on top) SGC 10\r\nGeorge Schirm SGC 10\r\nDode Criss SGC 10\r\nChristy Mathewson white cap raw, trimmed but clean and presentable. I would take a graded example. Must be a beater.",
