Prefer that these are either in SGC or PSA holders, but will make an exception for the right card raw.  I will take any of these in lower grade, but keep in mind set so far is 3.5 average for HOF cards.\r\n\r\nMordecai Brown (Chicago on Shirt)    SC350/25\r\nMordecai Brown (Portrait)   SC 350/25\r\nFrank Chance (Yellow Portrait)   SC 350-460/25\r\nJohnny Evers (Chicago on Shirt) SC 350-460/25\r\nJohnny Evers (Chicago on Shirt) SC 350-460/42\r\nJohnny Evers (Portrait)   SC 350/25\r\nJoe Tinker (Bat off Shoulder)   SC 350/25\r\nJoe Tinker (Bat on Shoulder)   SC 350-460/25\r\nJoe Tinker (Hands on Knees)   SC 350/25\r\nJoe Tinker (Portrait)   SC 350/25\r\n\r\nPM me anything you might have available or email [url]steve@asmusherefords.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve",
