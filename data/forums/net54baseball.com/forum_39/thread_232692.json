Lately I have focused on the T206 set, and particularly rarer backs of HOFs. In addition to a Magie 3 (Piedmont), I have acquired a Cy Young bare hand 7, sovereign back, a Cobb red SGC 80, Tolstoi back, an Evers Chicago on shirt BVG, Broad leaf back, and a Walter Johnson hands at chest 5, Old Mill.\r\n\r\nI really like the rare(er) backs but would appreciate thoughts on what premium they worth (over Piedmont and Sweet Corporal). I understand that some backs are rarer than others, and I don't need the minutia of the factory (although series is relevant), but just wondering what you all thought the premium one should pay the various HOF rarer backs. And further, what extra premium, if any, should be given a relatively low population or the highest graded of an example (like my Cobb Tolstoi)? Sincere thanks",

Sincere thanks[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWow you got some nice cards!! I'm not even close to be among the most knowledgeable on this board but I'll give it a shot. Based on my experience there are basically four or so groups. Drum, BL, Lenox, etc are anywhere from 20X-50X. AB, Brown Hindu, Pied 42 in the 5X-15X range. Tolstoi, EPDG, etc 2X-5X. Finally at 1X you have pied, sweet cap, pb, cycle, etc. ( non pieds and sweet caps may get a slight premium). Of course most of its driven by population, presentation, etc. I'm sure others on here will be a little more insightful but that's my take on it.\r\n\r\nBTW, I love the topic of this thread but it should probably be moved out of b/s/t.",
