      "post_content": "I'm working on back runs for these four T206s, and I figured it couldn't hurt to post here and see if anybody has anything I need. Listed below are the backs I don't have for each card, so if you have any of these and are willing to give it up, let me know. Trades are a possibility if I have something you want, or a straight-up purchase is OK. Some of the really tough ones here would be out of my price range right now for a straight purchase, but I'll worry about that if/when the time comes. E-mail at [url]djk1@ix.netcom.com[/url] is best, but PMs are OK.\r\n\r\nBacks needed (I'm not including backs that are listed as impossible or probable no-prints on T206resource.com; let me know if any abbreviations are unclear):\r\n\r\nCamnitz arms above head: AB 460, Lenox (black or brown), SC 460/25, Tolstoi, Uzit\r\n\r\nCamnitz arm at side: AB 460, Cycle 460, Lenox (black or Brown), SC 460/25, Uzit\r\n\r\nQuinn: Carolina Brights, Drum 350, EPDG, OM, PB, Sov 350, Tolstoi\r\n\r\nWiltse w/cap: AB 460, Cycle 460, EPDG, Lenox (brown), Uzit",
