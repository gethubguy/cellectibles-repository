I'm mainly looking for lower grades: A to 2-2.5. I'm mainly looking for decent eye appeal.\r\n\r\nJack Chesbro\r\nWalter Johnson ( Either one)\r\nCy Young ( Any variation)\r\nHugh Duffy\r\nZach Wheat\r\nEddie Collins\r\nBender ( Portrait)\r\nBaker\r\nFlick\r\nGriffth ( Portrait)\r\nKeeler ( Portrait)\r\nMarqauird ( Portrait)\r\nWallace",

Griffith PSA 3 and Wallace PSA2, looks like a solid PSA4, must be a problem somewhere. Both are eye appeal above avg.\r\n\r\n225.oo they werent really for sale and I doubt look wise, I could not replace them w/o buying 4's no joke.",
