      "post_content": "Does anybody have a T206 Jake Beckley graded by SGC available in the $30-50 range? Looking at recent sales on eBay, the price range seems to be very reasonable and doable. The cheaper the better, as long as it's presentable. Looking in the 10-30 range grade-wise. Creases and corner wear doesn't bother me much, but I don't like marks or paper loss. \n\nThank y'all in advance! Cheers to the last day of 2016, and to a phenomenal 2017 to be!",
