Pop reports have only seen 2 graded total and I know there is an additional PSA 4 that didn't have a back designation from PSA and sold about 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nVery tough card to get regardless.  And a semi-popular player to boot.\r\n\r\nAsking $SOLD shipped. But will also entertain trades for EPDGs I need.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/Available/aThielmanABSGC20.jpg[/IMG]",
