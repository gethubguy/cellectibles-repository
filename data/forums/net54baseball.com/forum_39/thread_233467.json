      "post_content": "I bought this card several years ago when ISA first started. The card measures out, as a matter of fact, it is a tad over the standard T206 length measurements.  SGC looked at this card at the National and thought it looked looked good, but has to be cracked out to grade. I have heard the horror stories on cracked out cards, so is it better off graded ISA 8, or cracking out and risking a skeptical grader? I have compared this card to dozens of my other T206s and the card stacks up. A PSA 8 would go for $25K+ range (there's only 2 PSA 8's, none higher, and only 5 PSA 7's). Asking $4500 delivered..",
