Some of these combos are pretty common and those are not the ones I am looking for.  Willing to pay a premium for scarcity.  Let me know what you have and I'll get back to you quickly with which cards I am interested in.  I can buy or trade.  Have around 300 cards that could be trade bait for things that interest me.  You can check out most of them here:  [url]http://stores.ebay.com/lukesvintagecards[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
