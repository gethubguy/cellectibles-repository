Obviously hand cut but maybe not missing the color of true scrap. \r\n\r\nCollins- $700\r\nWhite-$300\r\nMilan- $500\r\n\r\nAt this point I am looking for an offer on one or all three. Needless to say I know the demand is down but nothing ventured nothing gained.\r\n\r\nAlso have a highly out of registration Hartsel for sale. \r\n\r\nAgain looking for offers as I am not sure what these are currently bringing.\r\n\r\nThank you",
