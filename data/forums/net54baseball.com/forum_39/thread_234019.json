This little guy is a Johnny Kling Old Mill, graded SGC 4--I would love the opportunity to purchase this for my back run. I have PayPal ready to make a generous offer. Please contact me if you purchased the lot and would be interested in parting with the Kling!\r\nThank you very much,\r\nNJ :]\r\n[url]njdunkin1@gmail.com[/url]",

It was a mega steal indeed, probably part of the reason why it hurts so much :(. Thank you for the watchcount link, I never knew a website such as this existed.\nI have tried reaching out to the seller for more information, but to no avail. I can now only hope the buyer splits up the lot.\nSearching,\nNJ :)",
