The card is graded SGC 50 VG-Ex.\r\n\r\nIt has a nice picture, with honest wear on the corners. This is a pretty nice card. Take a look for yourself.\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/06-442.html\"][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-442t.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nClick on the picture to view a larger picture of the front and back.[/URL]\r\n\r\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back. \r\nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board. \r\nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\nCy",
