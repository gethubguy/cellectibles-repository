      "post_content": "**SOLD**\r\n\r\nReally strong centering gives this card an added boost. The coloring probably makes it the most vivid T206 I've owned. I hope to use the funds to downgrade to a rougher copy with a rarer back. However, I have heard that the P350 can still be quite tough. Please note: this card was purchased back in October for $222.00 via Goodwin, so a great deal can be had here.\r\nAlso, my scanner is a bit like a potato, so please check out the following link for higher resolution scans.[URL=\"http://goodwinandco.com/T206_Piedmont_350_Subjects_Factory_25_Bull_Durham_-LOT34155.aspx\"](Click here for link)[/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sale: $207.55\r\nPrice includes priority mail delivery with signature confirmation/insurance (YTBD). \r\nFor offers or questions, please email me at [url]njdunkin1@gmail.com[/url] or send me a PM. A commitment to purchase will take precedence over ongoing negotiations.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\nNJ :]",
