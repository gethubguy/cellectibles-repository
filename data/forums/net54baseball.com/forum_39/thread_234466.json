I have never been to the National but I am trying to use this new endeavor as an excuse. To that end I will be offering some of my cards for sale through the website. As an added bonus each card will come with a 4Show frame to help you display your old cardboard like a piece of art.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who might be interested I just posted the following cards:\r\n\r\nT206 Frank Smith (Boston and Chicago) SGC 80/6 Factory 42 Overprint\r\nT206 Tris Speaker PSA 2.5\r\nT206 Nap Lajoie (Batting) PSA 4\r\nT206 John Titus SGC 20/1.5\r\n\r\nTo see additional pictures and pricing please check out our listings:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.4showframes.com/card-shop/[/url]",
