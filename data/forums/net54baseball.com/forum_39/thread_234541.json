      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI have for sale a 1910 T206 Doc Adkins (Balt) card.  This is a T206 card that is more scarce than most of the T206 commons.\n\nThe front has a nice picture, with honest wear on the corners. The back has a some paper loss. But overall, this is a decent Doc Adkins card.\n\n Take a look for yourself.\n\nThe price is lowered to $65.\n\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/06-005.html\"][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-005t.jpg[/IMG]\n\nClick on the picture to look at a larger scan of the front and back.[/URL]\n\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back. \nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board. \nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nCy",
