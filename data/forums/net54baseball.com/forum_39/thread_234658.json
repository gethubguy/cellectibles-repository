When I posted the cards up here, I'd thought I'd just look up the prices, and trade or sell them. My main expertise isn't in the t206 (in fact, I'm a beginner at best). I've acquired these in a big trade lot, and I haven't really paid attention to them in awhile.\r\n\r\nI am having a real hard time coming up with the prices for some of these (most of these - especially the hindus), because I just don't see any prior sales. And ones I do are so long ago that I kind of don't know how to price them. If someone could help with them, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to put up pics one by one as I figure them out:\r\n\r\nCy Young Old Mill - I'll price it at $600 (I actually dont know if that's crazy or not)\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://s28.postimg.org/4efu4tvvh/cy2_2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://s29.postimg.org/gmb19cwvb/cy2_1.jpg[/IMG]",

He also mentioned his relative newness to T206s, so he may have just elected to keep the cards. I hope he pipes in with something soon :)\n\nIn the meantime, I spoke with him about a post he made a few months back on Blowout Forums. I remember when he made that post--he added photos of his card display. Pretty dang cool :)\n\nCheers,\nNJ\n\nAttached: I located the photos from David's original Blowout post.",

I PM asking for scans & prices for 2 cards - he replys back to make him an offer (no scans or prices were included in his \"reply\"). I send another PM stating I will talk price once I see condition, then, magically, no reply....Hmmmm. I would suggest knowing the value of something before you try to sell it so you don't get fleeced or PO your target audience, dude....",
