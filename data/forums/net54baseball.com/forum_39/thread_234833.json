I'm actually doing the back run for the batting pose and completed the run for the throwing pose. Throwing was much easier not having any super tough backs. I'm doing the 205 back run for Murph as well, having a cough time with getting a checklist for Murphy/back combos. I have both m116 backs for him, m101 backs. For colgan chips I'm just missing the tin top. I have both 14 and 15 CJs also working on any and all of his E series and their backs (not a priority). Im at 70 different Murphy issue/ back combinations/ variations with numerous other dupes. I'm after any Murphy issue that's available. I will keep this thread updated though. Thanks for your interest.\r\n\r\nRon",

As you can see with what I have left why I say it's the last realistic one for me to obtain at this point. I think it will be a long ride though.",
