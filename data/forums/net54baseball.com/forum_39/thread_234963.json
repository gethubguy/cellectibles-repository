      "post_content": "Many years ago, I decided to get my first t206. Big names were out of my budget so I searched the checklist to find who I was going to purchase. I found a guy who shares the same last name as me so I figured, \"Why not this guy?\". Knowing absolutely nothing about the set, I probably picked up a batting SC or Piedmont something since they're so common. After my first purchase I learned my guy had two different poses. You guessed it, I had to get one of those as well. Then I found you guys and the wealth of knowledge you share here daily. Now after so many years I'm at 23/27 different Wilhelms. The Drum isn't in the near future but maybe I could get at least one of the other 3. Any help is appreciated.
