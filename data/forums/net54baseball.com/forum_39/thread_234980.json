Looking for SOLD for the lot with free shipping and would like payment to be a PayPal gift to [url]lisajoe97@yahoo.com[/url]. Thanks.\n\nI still can't get large pics on here, I think it's because I take my pictures with my I-pad. I have tried almost everything. \n\nIf you need larger pics, I just need your email address.\n\nJoe.\n\nSOLD",
