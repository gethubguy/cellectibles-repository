      "post_content": "Hey Everyone-\n\nLike just about everyone on this forum, I LOVE everything about t206 cards from the variations to the backs! I have always wanted to incorporate their designs (and other tobacco card designs) into shirts and have finally completed my first design. \n\nI have Short-Sleeved and Long-Sleeved Available, with pictures of my favorites below! These are a limited edition run, so only available for about a week.\n\nNow WITH AND WITHOUT Front Chest Logo\n\n\nYou can get a shirt HERE: [URL=\"https://teespring.com/BBHeritage_Piedmont_2017#pid=369&cid=6512&sid=back\"]with Front Chest Logo\n[/URL]\n\nOnly available until 10p CST - 2/21/17\n\n[URL=\"https://teespring.com/the-tobacco-card-shirt-2017#pid=369&cid=6518&sid=back\"][IMG]http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f48/SMVintage/back.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"https://teespring.com/the-tobacco-card-shirt-2017#pid=11&cid=2500&sid=back\"][IMG]http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f48/SMVintage/back%201.jpg[/IMG]\n[/URL]\n[IMG]http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f48/SMVintage/Front%201.png[/IMG]\n\nThank you for the look!",

Pockets are not an option through the company I am using. \n\nAs for the logo, I will take that into consideration- I was avoiding using the card fronts since there are numerous different combos and I wanted to use multiple colors for the shirt. (Also, my target market isn't just collectors). Additionally, I have a stack of baseball designs (in addition to the tcards) so more or less attempting some branding\n\nI will definitely look into other options though",
