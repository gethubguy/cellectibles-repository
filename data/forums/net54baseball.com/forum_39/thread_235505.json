      "post_content": "Hello all.\n\nTrying to piece together some Sam Crawford cards for my personal collection.\n\nSince I am not on an unlimited budget...I am not looking for any high grade expensive examples, but looking for cards with nice eye appeal ...graded or ungraded  does not matter.\n\nI have picked up a few cards from fellow board members and other sources recently.. (I had a post about a month ago on the pre WWII thread and that got me 3 new cards for my collection) ......so thought I would just throw a note out here to see what might be available from anyone that are T206's  \n\nThe only example I currently own of a T206 Crawford is an Old Mill Crawford Batting\n\nIf you have anything available feel free to post here or send me a PM. \n\nHappy Collecting!\n\nDave",
