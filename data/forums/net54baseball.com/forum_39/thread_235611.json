But you can take a look for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe price for this group is $105 if you use PayPal F & F.\r\nThe price is $109 if you use regular PayPal with fees.\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/baltimore.html\"][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-075t.jpg[/IMG]\r\nClick on the picture to look at a larger scan of all of the fronts and backs of the five cards[/URL]\r\n\r\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back. \r\nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board. \r\nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\nCy",
