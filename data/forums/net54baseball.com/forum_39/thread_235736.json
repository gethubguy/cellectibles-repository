Bridwell will be re-listed.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have for sale a three T206 New York Nationals player cards. \r\n\r\nAll cards are decent. The Bridwell is actually very nice. In the upper right corner of the Bridwell, that is a hair in the scan, not a crease. Take a look for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe price for this group is now $70 if you use PayPal F & F.\r\nThe price is now $74 if you use regular PayPal with fees.\r\n\r\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/nynat.html\"][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-054t.jpg[/IMG]\r\nClick on the picture to look at a larger scan of all of the fronts and backs of the three cards[/URL]\r\n\r\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back. \r\nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board. \r\nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\nCy",
