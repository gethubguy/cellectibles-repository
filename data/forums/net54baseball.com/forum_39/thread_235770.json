      "post_content": "I am auctioning most of my SGC set registry collection of T206 Hall of Fame players on eBay this week. (I am keeping Cobb, Mathewson and a few others for sentimental reasons).\r\n\r\nYou can find a link to the auctions here: [url]http://www.ebay.com/usr/wolverinejayhawks[/url]\r\n\r\nThere are 28 different HOFer T206 cards between SGC 10 and SGC 50 with most around SGC 30, so they will be affordable to many collectors.  Auctions end Monday night, 2-27.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nVince (aka wolverinejayhawks)",
