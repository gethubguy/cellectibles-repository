Greatly prefer SGC graded but would consider PSA/BVG/GIA/Raw for the right deal. I want the grade range to be A-2 for the most part. I'm looking for these players, for the most part, the variation does not matter for players with more then one card in the set:\n\nBaker\nBrown\nChance\nClarke\nCobb\nCollins\nDuffy\nEvers\nFlick\nGriffth\nJennings\nJohnson\nKeeler\nLajoie\nMarqaurd\nMcGraw\nSpeaker\nTinker\nWallace",
