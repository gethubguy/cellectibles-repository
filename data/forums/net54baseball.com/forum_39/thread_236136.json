      "post_content": "I am interested in trading for T206 HOF's that I need for my set. I have a Bresnahan AB 350 in a PSA 2.5 and may be able to add in some other cards for something I need. The Bresnahan has a printer crop mark at the top of the card . I had a Joss P42 but it has been traded....I am looking for PSA 4 or 5's with backs other than Sweet Caporal and Piedmont. Sweet Caporal overprints would be of potential interest . SGC cards are OK as well but I prefer PSA. . I may have some other cards to trade along with the Bresnahan if someone offers something I need",
