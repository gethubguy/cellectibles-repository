      "post_content": "This thread is devoted to ongoing sales of T206 cards from my collection.  Pricing will be provided, but like the stock market the prices of each card will change daily, up or down.  The new prices will replace the former prices, which will cease to be valid once replaced.  Each card will be sold for the current listed price only.  Once sold, cards will be removed from the market.  You may purchase by responding to the thread or via PM.  Time stamps will be used to determine who gets the card with the earliest stamp being the winner.  All prices will include shipping and are net to me.  If you don't like the price, don't haggle, just wait for a lower price.  With the opening of this thread, all past unsold listings will be declared null and void.  Prices will change daily in all US time zones sometime during the evening or the morning hours.  Today's listings follow:\n\nDONF35 - The most difficult of the Donlin cards SGC35 for $50\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=269540&d=1492213048[/IMG]\n\nPA45 Try a Pattee Combo by adding another card.

Prices include shipping in the US,  but I will ask Canadian buyers to pay a shipping surcharge on the basis of actual shipping charges to Canada less single card domestic shipping of $2.67.  Most of you understand the need for this as free shipping to Fargo does not equal free shipping to Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nNew cards have been added to replace the cards that have been sold.  Check back frequently for pricing changes and new additions.  Remember as well the prices will rise or fall on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nIf this format is successful, I will consider ways to expand the market if there is enough demand.  Thanks for your interest so far.",
