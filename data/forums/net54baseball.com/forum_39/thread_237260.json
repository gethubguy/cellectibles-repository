      "post_content": "Hi everyone, currently i'm looking to add the following 18 T206 Polar Bear Backs to my personal set. I'm looking for lower grade raw or PSA/SGC 1 to 2.5 that have very little or no paper loss, untrimmed, and no ink marks. Just looking for good honest wear. If you have something in the 3 to 4 grade range and the price is right, that might work too. You can PM me and or send me an email with scans and prices at [url]d2ad2a@aol.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for everyones help.\r\n\r\nPolar Bear Backs Only\r\n\r\nAbbott, Fred\r\nAdkins, Doc\r\nBescher, Bob (Hands In Air)\r\nCrandall, Doc (Portrait With Cap)\r\nDorner, Gus\r\nFrill, John\r\nHoward, Del\r\nHummel, John\r\nKleinow, Red (New York - Catching)\r\nMeyers, Chief\r\nNichols, Simon (Batting)\r\nO'Brien, Peter\r\nSchulte, Wildfire (Back View)\r\nShaw, Hunky\r\nSheckard, Jimmy (Glove Showing)\r\nSteinfeldt, Harry (With Bat)\r\nWhite, Jack\r\nWiltse, Hooks (Portrait - With Cap)",
