      "post_content": "Hello Guys,\r\nAfter deciding to tackle the Monster a few year ago, I first built a 502/524 Set out of\r\nwhatever I could find. Raw or Slabs were of no concern. After that, I converted it to all\r\nslabs. I didn't buy junk but I did \"settle\" on more than a few occasions. I have now moved on to the \"UPGRADE PHASE\".\r\n\r\nONLY TWO TO GO>>>>>>\r\nThe Number next to each card is the minimum PSA/SGC grade that would be an UPGRADE for me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(446) Tubby Spencer4/50\r\n(342) Danny Murphy (throwing)4/50",
