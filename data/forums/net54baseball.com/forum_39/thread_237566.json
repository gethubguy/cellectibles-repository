I actually purchased two of these during this time - one I had slabbed by SGC and it came back Authentic (sold it awhile ago).  This card will probably grade the same.  Here's a post about these cards:\r\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=210363[/url]\r\n\r\n$22 shipped in pwe - paypal ff or add $$$",
