Okay if it's $60k that might work too :)\r\n\r\nSo... looking for large raw lots in decent shape (do these even exist anymore)?\r\n\r\nInteresting note: We've done this type of project around a dozen times over the past 30 years...but it was MUCH easier in the 1980s\r\n\r\nEmail me what you all have along with asking prices.  Not looking for singles at this point unless they are Cobb or Demmitt/O'Hara.   \r\n\r\nEmail: [url]Scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
