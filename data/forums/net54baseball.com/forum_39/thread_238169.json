Are you saying the cards pictured above have a a trade value of $1600?  What cards are sold?  So all the cards pictured here are not for sale cuz a few have been sold but the ones that are not sold are for $1600 or $1600 in value? Wut!\r\n\r\nHate to say it like this but there is no way the cards pictured above have anywhere near that value. You have a few nice cards and a lot of lower condition lower value commons. \r\n\r\nTake a look at the BS&T, specifically individual T206 sales and their actual sales price.  Spend some time on eBay looking at sold values of various cards, especially the cards you own. There is your market value.  If you paid more than these amounts I don't know what to tell you. If you paid less, then you are on your way.   Suggest you do a little more homework but this is really none of my business, it's yours.  Guess this means I am not a potential trade partner, sorry.  Good luck in getting that Mantle.",
