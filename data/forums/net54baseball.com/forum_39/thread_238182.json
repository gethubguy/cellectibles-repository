Yes, the price is not quite in accordance with most 5's, but it's not ridiculous either based on the strengths of this card and what others have sold for. A fairly recent PSA 6 just sold for $1800 at Heritage Auctions that paled in comparison to this card in my opinion.  Sometimes you have to buy the card and not the holder, I've been guilty many times as I was on this one.  I looked at this card under a magnifying glass and found no wrinkles, a couple of members have asked about this. Your guess is as good as mine as to the grade. Thanks again for the inquiries, if it doesn't sell, I think I'm going to take Tim's advice and resubmit to PSA...",
