Please add $2 for shipping regardless of how many you want.\r\n\r\nWilling to listen to offers, especially if buying multiple cards. Anyone saying \"I'll take it\" gets Priority over ongoing negotiations.\r\n\r\nI also have a number of trimmed commons currently available on eBay. Can definitely work a deal with those....20% off all ungraded and save a few bucks on shipping.  I still have a bunch of other trimmed cards including HOFers and a Lundgren Cubs so PM me if you are looking for specifics.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/sch/thromdog/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from=[/url]\r\n\r\n$SOLD Stark SL\r\n$SOLD Jordan SL Old Mill oversized. \r\n$SOLD Orth SL oversized\r\n$SOLD Paige SL oversized\r\n$SOLD Helm SL oversized\r\n$SOLD Jennings portrait\r\n$SOLD Bender portrait. \r\n$SOLD Flick\r\n$SOLD Keeler portrait.\r\n$SOLD Brown portrait. \r\n$SOLD Brain - nice card with slight diamond cut\r\n$SOLD Cassidy\r\n$SOLD Nichols batting\r\n$SOLD Evers Cubs on shirt\r\n$SOLD Davis",
