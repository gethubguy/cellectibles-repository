Looking for a 1.5-2 in an SGC holder but psa would not be a deal breaker.\nPlease let me know what you guys have available via PM or email [url]maxjacks89@yahoo.com[/url]. I've really enjoyed all the deals I've made on here so far\n\nThanks \nMax\n\n I'm also doing the T205 Giants set so if you have any 4-5 SGC graded let me know",
