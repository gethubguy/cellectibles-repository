      "post_content": "Hello all. I had good luck recently with some fantastic trades I made with board members a few weeks back so I thought I would try again. I have a SGC 55 4.5 Chance Yellow/Orange Portrait with a Sweet Caporal Factory 42 Overprint scroll back. The color and clarity are great on this card. It is a double for me as I have the same card with an EPDG back .  I would like to trade it for another hall of famer with a SC overprint back in a similar grade. I would also be interested in HOF'S with backs other than Piedmont. Polar Bear, Sovereign, Old Mill or even more difficult backs would be great to hear about. I could include other cards in the trade in an upgrade or the card and $. I prefer PSA cards in the 4-5 range but would consider other SGC cards. Let me know if anyone has anything they would like to trade for this desirable Chance Portrait",
