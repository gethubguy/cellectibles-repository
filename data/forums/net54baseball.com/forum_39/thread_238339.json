      "post_content": "Back after taking a long hiatus....I'm assembling another T206 set, this time all in PSA 4, NO QUALIFIERS.  Looking to pay $40-55 per common and MLer, right along VCP pricing and past eBay sales.  Need everything, even SLers and HOFers, as I just started this week and only have about 40-50 of the 524 so far.  As long as it is in line with past eBay AUCTION sales (aberrant/outlying PWCC sales withstanding), I'm interested.  Only want to pick up packages of 5-10 cards minimum.  PM me anything you've got.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
