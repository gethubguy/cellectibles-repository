If it's too tricky to post pics, simply a breakdown of players, back and condition may suffice.  \r\n\r\nWith that said, if around half of the group is vg/ex or better I will take it at your asking price.  If not, I'd still be interested in purchasing all cards that fall into that condition category.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to email me with details: [url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
