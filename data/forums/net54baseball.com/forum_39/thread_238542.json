Take a look for yourself.\n\nThe price for the card is now $28 if you use PayPal F & F; $30 if you use regular PayPal with fees.\n\n[URL=\"http://www.cyscards.com/t206/06-054.html\"][IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/t206/picsb/06-054t.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nClick on the picture to look at a larger scan of the front and back of the card.\n\nJust a note about me, I used to post a lot more on the Net 54 board a few years back.\nI've moved away from collecting but now I am selling some of my remaining cards. I have had many dealings on this board.\nI wanted to make this comment because I haven't been on this board that much in a while.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nCy",
