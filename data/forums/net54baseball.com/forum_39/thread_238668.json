      "post_content": "Currently selling off my duplicates. Today I'm offering a T206 Bill Bradley Sweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 30 (missing the overprint scroll). This is one of the \"No Print\" scraps that came from a collection offered on eBay between June 2015 & April 2016. These cards were all hand cut and there are a few articles about them on net54baseball.com. Currently PSA list 2 of them graded and they have listed them separate from the rest of the set. I have not personally seen any of these cards listed since the initial offering that was on eBay. Asking $800.00 PP F&F to: [url]rockyhillconnecticut@aol.com[/url] and shipping/insurance is on me. Earliest Private Message to me with \"I'll take it\" wins it.\r\n[IMG]http://www.comicplace.com/ebay/billbradleywithbatfront04222017.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://www.comicplace.com/ebay/billbradleywithbatback04222017.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nRon",
