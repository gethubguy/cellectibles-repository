I started a thread in the Net54baseball Vintage (Pre-WWII) Baseball Cards & New Member Introductions  section called \u201cThe Ultimate Trade up\u201d.  Feel free to go catch up on it when you get a chance, a grab a bag of pop corn because it\u2019s filled with opinions.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the point of the thread is that I started off with this card \r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/vogr3ea2/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/vogr3ea2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\nAnd am attempting to trade all the way up to a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle Rookie Card.\r\nHere is where I stand at the moment\u2026.\r\nStarted with a Walter Johnson T-205 SGC 40.\r\n\r\nTurned it into......\r\n\r\nT206 Bender, no trees, psa 4 HOF SOLD $150\r\nT206 McGraw, at hip, psa 3 HOF SOLD $110\r\nT206 McGraw, port w/cap psa 2 HOF SOLD $110\r\nT206 Chase, pink, psa3 SOLD $110\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far shipping has ran me $23.58 leaving me with $456.42 and the following cards/photos left for sale or trade.\r\n\r\nT206 McGraw, finger air, psa2 HOF \r\nT206 Kelly, psa3 HOF\r\nT206 Pelty, vert, psa 4.5\r\nT206 McEvlveen, bvg 4\r\na very nice raw NM range 62 topps Mays AS card\r\nT-206 Rube Marquard \r\nHonus Wagner Photo\r\n\r\nSee photos below\r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/p8gpmjkp/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/p8gpmjkp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/84nr4yc2/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/84nr4yc2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/42zs5ex5/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/42zs5ex5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/4054h28m/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/4054h28m.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/fq141999/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/fq141999.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/5jti8h55/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/5jti8h55.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/6r6xx5i8/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/6r6xx5i8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/xoji9j8y/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/xoji9j8y.jpg[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/6yf2444x/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/6yf2444x.JPG[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/86toh41r/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/86toh41r.JPG[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/eip420xh/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/eip420xh.JPG[/IMG][/URL]   \r\n\r\n[URL=https://sportscardalbum.com/card/4388s0s8/n-a][IMG]https://sportscardalbum.com/c/4388s0s8.JPG[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking to sell, but would trade up from anyone of these cards.\r\nHere are a few examples of potential trade partners I am looking for\u2026\r\n1.You really need or want some of these cards, and have a card worth more; that you either have dupes of or lost a passion for.  Since my goal is to trade UP, I would be looking for something of more value (not picky at all as to what I get in return), yet you would be getting something you wanted more without coming out of pocket a dollar.\r\n\r\n2.You have a beautiful card that is worth $1000 that you have been trying to sell for 2 years.  You simply have not found a buyer yet.  I have a card (s) that are easier for you to sell, so you make a trade taking a small hit knowing you can liquidate my cards quicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne major problem the thread seemed to generate has been someone people were rubbed the wrong way thinking I was looking for charity. Let me make it clear that I am not looking for charity. I am looking to trade up.  If the trade does not make sense for you then there is no point to do it obviously.  However, I am open to just about anything which really opens me up to basically any trade. Autographs, Cards, Photos, Etc Etc\r\nThink you are a fit? PM ME or even post on my main thread and let\u2019s get the ball rolling boys!!!! (and girls)",
