      "post_content": "I would prefer some kind of trade if it makes sense.\n\nI have a nice T204 Mordecai Brown PSA 6.  But I'd rather upgrade it to a Johnson.\n\nI also have a nice SCG 40 (3) T206 Walter Johnson portrait \u2013 I could argue higher\u2026\n\nAnyway, I would like to parlay those two or some combo into a Johnson upgrade.  Of course, I would also agree to a multi-step process if it was right.\n\nSince the T204 Brown infrequently sells in that condition, I am not sure of its value, but I do see one that recently went for $5,500 or so.  Don\u2019t know if that was high, avg, or low.  The T206 Johnson is probably somewhere between $1,000 and $1,500 (optimistic!).\n\nThat means that the T204 Johnson would want to be a nice 3 or 4 to be roughly compatible.  I think...\n\n[url]scomeau@spantech.com[/url]\n\nIt must either be graded by the big 3 or I must first have it examined for correctness.  Thanks.",
