Didn't try to clean any of the fronts.\r\n\r\nPlease add $2 for shipping, no matter how many you buy. Any form of PayPal accepted.  I will listen to offers if you want more than 1, but anyone saying they will take it gets Priority.  There are a few I've been debating keeping so I have a higher price for them.....\r\n\r\nI will also listen to trades and package deals.....especially for EPDGs and HOFers.\r\n\r\n\r\n$SOLD Chesbro\r\n$SOLD Clark\r\n$SOLD Flick\r\n$SOLD Keeler portrait\r\n$SOLD Lundgren Chicago\r\n$SOLD Marquand hands thighs\r\n$SOLD McGraw finger\r\n$SOLD Tinker hands knees\r\n$SOLD Waddell throwing\r\n$SOLD Wallace\r\n\r\nSOLD: \r\n$SOLD Brown portrait no-name\r\n$SOLD Brown portrait\r\n$SOLD Evers\r\n$SOLD Keeler batting\r\n$SOLD Lajoie fielding\r\n$SOLD Lajoie portrait\r\n$SOLD Walsh\r\n$SOLD Griffith\r\n$SOLD Jennings\r\n$SOLD Joss",
