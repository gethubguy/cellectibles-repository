If you have access to VCP, you can probably find the sale and even match the tobacco stains, it was within the last couple years.  I paid $500.  Willing to sell for $400 PP F&F (or add 3% for regular PP).  I think I may still have the flip (not sure), but I'll certainly include it if I do.  Please do not contact me and ask me if I am willing to sell for less.  This is my rock bottom price.  Thanks for looking.",
