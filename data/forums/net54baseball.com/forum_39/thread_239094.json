Selling it for exactly what I paid - $235.  \r\n\r\nThe photo was also purchased from a fellow board member about a year or so ago.  Asking $200.\r\n\r\nWill sell both as a package for $415.\r\n\r\nPrices are firm, please don't ask otherwise.  Selling to purchase a red Cobb, so I would also consider a cash + cards deal for your red Cobb in the VG/EX range.",
