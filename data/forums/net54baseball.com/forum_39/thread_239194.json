Most of my cards are between a 1-2.5, but present very nicely.  \r\n\r\nAlso working on a Lavender back run!\r\n\r\nTook a long break from collecting, but I am back at it with very little left save my T's.  Sold off my Delongs, my Cracker Jacks, and most everything else.\r\n\r\nScans of both sides always appreciated, and PMs always work best.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJ.R.",
