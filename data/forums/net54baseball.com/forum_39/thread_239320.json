      "post_content": "This Card is SOLD\r\n\r\nLajoie throwing with a Sweet Caporal Overprint Back. It was originally in a BGS 3 holder. The card is nice with good color and clarity and some very light wrinkling that doesn't break the surface. It was sent to PSA raw and came back with evidence of trimming . It measures correctly 1 7/16 x 2 5/8 and I don't see an obvious trim . It was cracked out to get graded with other raw cards to avoid a second shipping charge that PSA so graciously insists upon. I am asking 200.00 for the card. If you are interested or have any other questions please send me a pm or email through the system and I will reply as soon as possible. I am attaching a raw scan and the scan of the original BGS holder",
