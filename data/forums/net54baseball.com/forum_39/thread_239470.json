Shipping is included in the price.\r\n\r\nEmail & PayPal: [url]jasonemil@comcast.net[/url]\r\n\r\nCy Young (PSA 3) - *** SOLD ***\r\n\r\nAccording to the PSA population report, there is only a population of 4 Cy Young portraits with this back with none having a higher grade.  PSA hasn't always listed the advertising backs so there could be a higher graded one out there just listed as a Cy Young Portrait.  Anyway it is a tough back for the Cy Young Portrait.",
