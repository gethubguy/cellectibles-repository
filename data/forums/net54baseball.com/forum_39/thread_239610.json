      "post_content": "I have had several mutually-successful trades with Net54 members over the past few months, and I would like to do more!  My current interest is in T206 HOF, rare-back cards, preferably in mid-higher grades (the rarer the front/back combo the better).  I have many cards already that fit that bill and I am interested in hearing from others with similar interests and potentially doing deals/trades with those people.  A few examples of recent trades include a common Drum SGC 10 for a Chance Lenox PSA 4; a 51 Bowman Mays 4 & 55 Clemente PSA 5 for a Cobb bat off 6; and a Lajoie Port, Sov 350, PSA 5 for an Evers Chicago shirt BL 350 PSA 1.  Top flight cards and trades.  Cards I would currently trade away range (for example) from a 48 Leaf Paige PSA 4 to T206 Matty white cap PSA 6, and much in between.  Cards I am looking for fall along that spectrum.  Even if you don\u2019t have a current interest in trading but have similar interests in cards, please reach out to me by PM or email (rhotchkiss@horizonlandco.com) so we can meet and maybe help one another out some day filling that want list.\r\n\r\nRyan",
