I'm constantly upgrading my core set, but also trying to resemble some balance....so if you have other interesting items to trade, let me know too.\r\n\r\nOtherwise take a look and throw me an offer. Anyone saying I'll take it gets priority over negotiations. PayPal F&F preferred please. Let me know if you need to pay via other methods.\r\n\r\nI have these cross-listed on eBay too.\r\n\r\n$SOLD Seitz Piedmont SGC 70.\r\n$SOLD Ferguson PSA 6(mc)\r\n\r\nPick a Donohue for me, I'm keeping which ever one doesn't sell\r\n\r\n$SOLD Donohue Sovereign SGC 40\r\n$SOLD Donohue SGC 35",
