      "post_content": "Looking to trade my duplicate T206 Sweet Caporal 150 Kaiser Wilhelm Hands at Chest SGC 20 for any other T206 that I don't have (in similar condition).  My monster number is 77, so there are 100's of T206 cards that I don't have.\r\n\r\nIf someone would prefer to buy the card, it is available for $30, including shipping with tracking.\r\n\r\nPlease PM me if you are interested in the card.\r\n\r\nThanks, Andrew",
