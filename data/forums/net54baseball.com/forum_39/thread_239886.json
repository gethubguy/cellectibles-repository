As I am sure you know, there is a wide range of values within each grade depending on the appearance and presentation of the card. I will gladly make a fair offer once I see the card, but I will not make an offer based solely on a grade without first seeing the card. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBen",
