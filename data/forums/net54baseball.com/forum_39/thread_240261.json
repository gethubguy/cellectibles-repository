      "post_content": "TRADED\r\n\r\nBump to revise Trade Want List.  I have $340 in the card, previous sale of a PSA-2 Tolstoi was in March of 2014 at a $291 Auction final price (that card has a noticeable crease and is not as well centered).\r\n\r\nFor Trade:  T206 Corrected Joe Doyle N.Y.  Hands Above Head, PSA-2 Tolstoi that is Nice-for-Grade and Centered both front & rear!\r\n\r\nA unique opportunity to own a Scarce Back Corrected version of \"one of the most valuable error cards in the entire hobby ... clearly the toughest to find among the T206 Rarities\" (The T206 Collection , Zappala). \r\n\r\nThe POP is 2 with only 1 higher.  Only 9 total cards of this Tolstoi version have been graded by PSA, with one of those being a PSA-1 Qualifier.\r\n\r\nThis will be a nice addition to anyone's Monster Collection, or T206 Sub-set/Run of Rare Backs, Oddities, NY Team etc.\r\n\r\nI am looking to trade for any card (or cards) that are at a good value that I can flip easily to pursue PSA HOF examples for my personal collection.  \r\n\r\nI was going to collect a T206 Scarce/Rare Back Run, but decided to concentrate on HOF examples from the 1950s or T206 Portraits instead. \r\n\r\nCheck your inventory for a trade candidate to acquire this neat card with an interesting Story.\r\n\r\nPlease Communicate via my email:  [url]arkansas2014@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/GoBigRed/t206/50733/t206-joe-doyle-tolstoi[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/GoBigRed/t206/50734/t206-joe-doyle-tolstoi[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSteve ....
