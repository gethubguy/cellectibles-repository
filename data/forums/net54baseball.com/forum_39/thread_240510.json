      "post_content": "I have a very nice Wallace SGC 60 for trade with a Sovereign 150 back. I am looking to trade this card for another HOF with a back other than SC or Piedmont. The Sovereign 150 seems to be much tougher than the 350 series in comparisons on the various population reports. All and all a very nice card. I am interested in any HOF's with backs other than Piedmont and SC but will consider Sweet Cap with Factory overprints are cards I would consider. Prefer PSA but will consider other SGC cards. I have other cards or cash I could add into the right deal. Mainly looking for 4's and 5's or above\r\n\r\nHere are cards I don't have which would be priorities for me. Cards I need are Chance Red Portrait , Chesbro, Evers Cubs Shirt , Huggins Portrait, Keeler Portrait, Lajoie Portrait and Throwing, Matty Portrait, Speaker, Tinker Portrait and Young Portrait. While I know most of these are tougher than Wallace I am willing to sweeten any deal with other cards or $ Always looking for Cobb's but who isn't? \r\n\r\nLet me know and please ask any questions or make any offers. Thank You",
