      "post_content": "Seven backs from Jake Thielman, who is listed as one of the tougher commons. Five of the cards have been graded, as shown in the pictures below. The SC 350 Factory 30 back is not graded, but the factory 25 is graded. American Beauty back in clearly trimmed, but it's a tough card. Cycle back is an SGC30 and the dark area in the scan is just a shadow. Polar Bear, Sovereign and Piedmont are the other backs.\r\n\r\nPayment PAYPAL FF $350, includes insured delivery with confirmation. If you want to spend a little more, I can upgrade the Piedmont and/or Polar Bear. PM for details.",
