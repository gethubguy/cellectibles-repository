Can throw in a few bucks in trade depending on condition. Willing to do an even swap if the card is in worse shape....like even a lot worse. \n\nI also have an ungraded Piedmont available too.\n\nWould also entertain trading for one with a Factory 30 back depending on condition.\n\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/Available/74B772A4-C11E-4EF3-8474-1F1C9C706F3C.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/Available/74B772A4-C11E-4EF3-8474-1F1C9C706F3C.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/Available/02DAB495-A6C8-4293-A7DC-F5C7FB3E8615.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i856.photobucket.com/albums/ab121/thromdog/Available/02DAB495-A6C8-4293-A7DC-F5C7FB3E8615.jpg[/IMG]",
