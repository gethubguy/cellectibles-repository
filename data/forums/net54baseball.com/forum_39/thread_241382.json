      "post_content": "I am selling 6 T206s - listed below. Asking $195 shipped (net to me) for the lot. I would consider breaking up the lot if you're interested in individual cards. I will add pictures tonight when I get home from work. Conditions are listed in parentheses. Some were slabbed and I freed them, but still have the label, and those will ship with them.\n\nCy Seymour (G/VG) - Sovereign 350 Apple Green\nFrancis Pfeffer (G/VG) - Sweet Caporal 460 Fact. 42\nBill Malarkey (F) - American Beauty 350 w/ Frame\nRuss Ford (G/VG) - Sweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 42\nMike Donlin (G/VG) - Polar Bear\nNeal Ball (G/VG) - Old Mill\n\nPM or Email me at [url]kmayusa6060@gmail.com[/url].\n\nThanks!",
