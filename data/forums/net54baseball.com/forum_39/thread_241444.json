      "post_content": "I'm now down to needing 50 T206s for a complete set of fronts, after years of off-and-on collecting on a budget. In addition to the top rarities (Wagner, Plank, Doyle, Demmitt, O'Hara, as well as Elberfield Washington), I also lack most of the top-tier HOFers, which are rarely available in my price range, and 9 of the 48 Southern Leaguers. But there are also plenty of commons I still don't have. \n\nBelow is the list of everything I need, with SLers and HOFers noted. If anybody has any of these available for a reasonable price, preferably but not necessarily raw, let me know. (I currently have 32 graded T206s out of 500+ total cards.) Eye appeal is big for me, and while I like a good, clean, crease-free card as much as the next guy, I don't mind technical flaws that don't detract much from the eye appeal, such as pinholes or unobtrusive paper loss on the back. That's especially true if it's an otherwise tough/expensive card. I don't have a ton of extra $$$ to spend right now, especially after some big recent purchases, but I thought I would throw this list up there while I'm thinking of it.\n\nMy PM box is close to full, so I'd prefer e-mail at [url]dkathman@uchicago.edu[/url].\n\nHeinie Berger\nBill Bernhard (SL)\nBill Bradley (portrait)\nBill Bradley (batting)\nJohn Butler\nTy Cobb (green portrait) (HOF)\nTy Cobb (red portrait) (HOF)\nTy Cobb (bat off) (HOF)\nTy Cobb (bat on) (HOF)\nDode Criss\nRay Demmitt (St. Louis)\nMike Donlin (seated)\nBill Donovan (portrait)\nMickey Doolin\nJoe Doyle (NY Nat'l)\nLarry Doyle (with bat)\nBull Durham\nKid Elberfield (Washington)\nEd Foster (SL)\nEd Greminger (SL)\nBuck Hooker (SL)\nMiller Huggins (portrait) (HOF)\nWalter Johnson (pitching) (HOF)\nWalter Johnson (portrait) (HOF)\nWillie Keeler (portrait) (HOF)\nNapoleon Lajoie (portrait) (HOF)\nNapoleon Lajoie (throwing) (HOF)\nNapoleon Lajoie (batting) (HOF)\nTommy Leach (with cap)\nPerry Lipe (SL)\nSherwood Magie\nSherwood Magee (portrait)\nJohn McGraw (glove at hip) (HOF)\nJohn McGraw (portrait with cap) (HOF)\nFred Merkle (portrait)\nHerbie Moran (Providence)\nDom Mullaney (SL)\nDanny Murphy (with bat)\nBill O'Hara (St. Louis)\nBill Otey (SL)\nFrank Owen\nEddie Plank (HOF)\nAmbrose Puttman\nRay Ryan (SL)\nAdmiral Schlei (portrait)\nShag Shaughnessy (SL)\nTris Speaker (HOF)\nHonus Wagner (HOF)\nCy Young (bare hand) (HOF)\nCy Young (portrait) (HOF)",
