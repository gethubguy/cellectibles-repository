Many years ago I lost interest in cards, and I'm finally getting around to selling the cards that were part of my collection.\r\nI'm NOT a card guy--I don't know grading, etc.  So...\r\nI'm going to list some cards, with large scans, and prices I think are fair.  You be the grader.  And feel free to make offers.",
