These are all quite nice and reflective of the grades given.  There is zero staining or creases on any cards (Aside from creasing on the Willis Tolstoi and stains on the two PBs).  Some of these cards are highest graded on combined SGC/PSA pop reports.  The prices listed are net to me.  Email inquiries are preferred: [url]rhotchkiss@horizonlandco.com[/url].
