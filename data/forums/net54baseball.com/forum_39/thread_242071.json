The prices below include shipping.\r\nDon't wait.  Next week's offering could be different, two topping pizzas, additional toppings, even anchovies may be offered.  You never know.\r\n\r\n#1 - TANNEHILL\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10583/tannehill-sov[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#2 - WILTSE\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10329/wiltse-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#3 - CLARKE\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10305/clarke-j-j[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#4 - HALL\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10254/hall[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#5 - REULBACH\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10863/reulbach-glove[/IMG]\r\n\r\n#6 - DEMMIT\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/47874/demmitt-ny[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMENU PRICES\r\n\r\n123      $160\r\n124      $OLD\r\n125      $150\r\n126      $155\r\n134      $157\r\n135      $148\r\n136      $153\r\n145      $145\r\n146      $152\r\n156      $144\r\n234      $115\r\n235      $111\r\n236      $114\r\n245      $110\r\n246      $113\r\n256      $108\r\n345      $106\r\n346      $112\r\n36      $74 Still available\r\n456      $102\r\n\r\nTheir is an advantage in being the first to order as all the toppings may be added only once.  Ironically once the first pizza (out of 20) is sold, only one will remain.\r\n\r\ntherefore 20 - 1 = 1  (but you knew that already)\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have never ordered a pizza, let's say you want Clarke, Wiltse & Demmit.  That would be Pizza #236 and on the menu you would find the price of $114 shipped.",

The Reulbach topping with Glove has mysteriously disappeared from the pie.\r\n\r\nThat leaves me with a measly two topping #36.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this remaining pizza, I will sell it as is for $74 shipped.\r\n\r\nIf you want three toppings though, I will even throw in a random card, and I do mean random, for no additional cost.",
