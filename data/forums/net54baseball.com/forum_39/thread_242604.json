      "post_content": "Solid good condition with some surface creasing from Clarke's left eye and ear up about 1/2 inch. VG corners, very slight chipping and two really tiny back surface creases from bottom of card up a few milimeters. Definitely a solid 2 (if slabbed) with nice eye appeal as the creases are very light. None extend to the back of card.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/5791340d-d2ef-4197-9e4f-4fda969abcc3_zpswv4nhotw.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/2016/4ed9d134-1090-457b-a5d1-5d7371299363_zps5ayyolsc.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAsking $55 delivered\r\n\r\nTom C",
