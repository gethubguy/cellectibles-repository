      "post_content": "Hoping to add a couple more of these to my collection.  My only real deal-breaker is the back can't have more than like 10% paper loss.  I'll consider everything, but my ideal condition is something like these 3:\r\n\r\nI have a ton of stuff to trade, and I can purchase as well.  I've won a decent amount of auctions lately, so I think I am paying pretty strong prices. \r\n\r\nPlease PM me if you have anything you would be willing to discuss.  Thanks!",
