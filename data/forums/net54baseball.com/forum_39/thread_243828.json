I `d really like to add a Green Cobb to my collection but wow appears that shipped has sailed so maybe Red, Bat On/Off as an alternative. As far as this Bat Off as others have mentioned, around 700.00 seems about right. Not crazy about the stains but overall presents decently enough for the average collector, can you find better, yes but it will take some luck because it`s not lasting long. My 2 cents and good luck with the hunt sir.",

As far as comparisons I would say that the fact the creases do not go through the face of of Cobb like the PSA 1.5 is a major benefit.
