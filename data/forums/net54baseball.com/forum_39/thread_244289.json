      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\n\nProbably a longshot, but:\n\nI'm looking to trade any of these plus cash or some other thing(s) for a nicer looking card with the same back.  Grades are not that important to me, but I don't want any paper loss on the back.  Ideally I'm hoping to find Major Leaguers rather than Minor Leaguers, but I know I can't be too picky.\n\nI have probably 300 different t206s that I could trade.  I have multiple copies of most backs below CB on the back scarcity rankings, including Hindus, Cycle 460s, ABs, Old Mills, Cycle 350, etc.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nLuke",
