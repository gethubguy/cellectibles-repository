      "post_content": "Looking to buy a lower grade T206 Cy Young, either the Glove Showing or Hand Showing, encapsulated by SGC (although I would consider PSA if the price is right). No writing, but creasing/corner wear is ok. Minor paper loss on the back would probably be ok, maybe even on the front if it is off to the side. I need to be in the $300 +/- range, which all but eliminates the Portrait with its healthy appreciation recently. \r\n\r\nPM or email me at [url]kmayusa6060@gmail.com[/url]. Thanks!",
