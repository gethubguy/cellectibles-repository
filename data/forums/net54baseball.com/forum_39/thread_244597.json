Yesterday was a joke, some people were saying it was real, others saying 100% fake, the truth being, no one was able to tell. From what I see today, nice card, the lower right crease hurts the value. It should be one a nice 2  - 2 1/2 grade card. If you check eBay, you'll see 2 grades with asking prices from $1,300 to $2,500. It's worth what someone will pay in that range.",
