      "post_content": "First off thanks to member here that have helped me out with some various Sam Crawford cards from a variety of issues.\r\n\r\nI am looking to add some different back varieties of T206 Crawfords.  I am hoping to find examples that are decent eye appeal in the 1-3 range but not looking to break the bank either as I am on a budget (aren't we all :D )\r\n\r\nI have the batting versions of Crawford with Tolstoi, EPDG  Old Mill and Piedmont 350 backs.  I have ZERO Crawford Throwing varieties.\r\n\r\nIf you have any available for sale, would appreciate if you could PM me with asking price and also scans of card.  You can also email me scans and pricing to my email, [url]sjohnson22@neb.rr.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks  and Happy Collecting!\r\n\r\nDave",
