Nevertheless the card was graded VG 3 by the folks at PSA.\r\nThe reverse is Sweet Caporal 350 subjects with the Factory 30 designation.\r\nAsking $45 shipped.  (PP F&F preferred)  If you want to pay more for this card, forget it.\r\nPS : The card is well centered front and back.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/10482/mullin-batting[/IMG]\r\n\r\nShipping is included in the asking price.",
