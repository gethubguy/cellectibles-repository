      "post_content": "I'm tossing around the idea of letting my Green Cobb go (which means they are about to skyrocket in value[emoji16]). It's an awesome card which has obviously been trimmed across the top border but excellent eye appeal. NO creasing, nice registration, decent centering. The fine line right between his eyes is actually a very small scratch on the case, not on the card. Just a nice chance to put an unbelievable card that looks great in your collection without breaking the bank. I have done two high dollar deals with fellow members recently.\nReduced to Sold pp f/f.[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=289944&d=1507206256[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=289945&d=1507206267[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=289946&d=1507206277[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
