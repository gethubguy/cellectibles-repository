Surprised at how many came back SGC \"A\" -- I guess I must be off my game in detecting trimming or other alterations.  Oh well.  \n\nSelling these for SOLD and/or RELISTED in Auction Thread.  Payment via PayPal friends/family.  \n\nEmail me at [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url] if you're interested.\n\nThanks for looking!",
