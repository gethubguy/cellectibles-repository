      "post_content": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nBeen pretty quiet lately for my collection.  Would love to add some rare backs, but I'd be happy with just some interesting mid-tiers as well.  Looking for a bunch of Tolstois, Cycles, ABs, Hindus (only major leaguers and no paper loss), and Old Mills (I mainly only need poses from the tougher 150-350 Series).\r\n\r\nIf you have anything you might part with, please shoot me an email at:\r\n\r\n[url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!",
