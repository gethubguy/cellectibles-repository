      "post_content": "Thought I'd offer up a few t206s I have available....\r\n\r\nGriffith - The Griffith was originally part of a puzzle that when put together displays an ad for Oaks Tobacco. On this example, you can see part of a hand, 2 sets of acorns and another symbol. There are a few other examples out there however, this sort of an \"underprint\" does not come up too often. The 1909 tobacco ad for \"Oaks Tobacco\" was originally printed while t206's where printed at American litho in NYC. --- Asking $500\r\n\r\nMarquard Piedmont 350 PSA 3 - no creasing...mild touches to corners --- $175\r\n\r\nRevelle Old Mill PSA 4 - Southern Leaguer...- no creasing...mild touches to corners --- $225 (sold!!)\r\n\r\nChase Portrait (Blue) Sweet Corporal 350 PSA 3 - Very sharp card with terrfic color, no creasing --- $75 (sold!!)\r\n\r\nSpade Scrap w/ Piedmont 150 reverse....Oversized borders --- $225 (Sold!!)\r\n\r\nPrices include shipping/insurance.
