      "post_content": "Think I'm working on a Frill back run now.  Need the Cycle 460 and the pipe-dream Uzit.  And, just want a tougher back for Ford, who had an unreal season on the mound in 1910.\r\n\r\nI have a ton of stuff to trade, but happy to buy as well.  I'm \"paying strong\", which to me means: I understand and appreciate that it takes time for you to find a card, scan it, and send me an email, and I won't lowball you after you do me that favor.",
