      "post_content": "I am trying to acquire 1 card for each person in the Hall of Fame (if possible). I have broken down the members by era (Pre-War, Post War, Modern), and have different requirements for each era. \r\n\r\nPre War: Any playing days card.\r\nPost War: Their last card.\r\nModern: Their rookie card.\r\n\r\nI am not looking to complete this project in one post, but want to see what's available and buy a little here and a little there. Additionally, I was going through my binder and need 15 T206s for 3 complete binder pages. I have some commons I'll eventually target, but want to knock out the backs I need first.\r\n\r\nThe following are a list of players/backs I currently need from the T206 set. The backs can be paired with any player in the T206 set, and the HoFers can be paired with any T206 back. I am looking for lower grade examples, with minimal to no paper loss, no writing/marks (stamps, especially date, might be ok), but creasing/wear is ok. I prefer the HoFers to be graded by SGC, but would consider other companies (raw is least preferred for the HoFers). \r\n\r\nBacks\r\n\r\n[STRIKE]Old Mill[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Old Mill SL[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Cycle 350[/STRIKE]\r\nSovereign 350 Apple Green\r\nAmerican Beauty 350 w/ Frame\r\nEPDG\r\nSweet Caporal 350-460 Fact. 25\r\nCycle 460\r\n[STRIKE]Sovereign 460[/STRIKE]\r\nAmerican Beauty 350 No Frame\r\n\r\nHoFers\r\n\r\nGeorge Davis (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Joe Kelley (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Jake Beckley (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nZack Wheat (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Sam Crawford (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Frank Baker (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nBobby Wallace (T206)\r\nMordecai Brown (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Ed Walsh (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Rube Waddell (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nJoe McGinnity (T206)\r\nClark Griffith (T206)\r\nJack Chesbro (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Frank Chance (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nHugh Duffy (T206)\r\nJimmy Collins (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Fred Clarke (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Roger Bresnahan (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nWillie Keeler (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Eddie Collins (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Tris Speaker (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n[STRIKE]Cy Young (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\nWalter Johnton (T206)\r\n[STRIKE]Christy Mathewson (T206)[/STRIKE]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease PM or email me at [url]kmayusa6060@gmail.com[/url]",
