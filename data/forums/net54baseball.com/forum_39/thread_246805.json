      "post_content": "Card itself is a dog.  Flaws as clearly shown.  But an opportunity to add it if you need it.\n\nPrice is firm at $6400.  If it sells, great, if it doesn't, no big deal.  Scans are from when I purchased it at Heritage.  If you need pics to prove I have it, send me an email to [url]navarro@flash.net[/url] as my phone pics are too large to upload in the thread.  Or if you need references, just ask around, I'm sure someone will vouch for me.  \n\nYou can pay cash and pick up in person in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex (I work in the Federal Building in Farmers Branch) or I also accept wires.  Card will be shipped registered mail if you don't pick it up in person.  \n\nMike",
