I sent this Chance in to PSA with the Evers (and tinker hands on knees that I sold on BST a few days ago), and it came back a 1. I have no need for this card and just put it on BST. Honestly never looked at flip other than the number (a 1).  it's yellow portrait and PSA messed up the flip. Error, error, the card is now worth a fortune!!! But I will still sell for $60....",
