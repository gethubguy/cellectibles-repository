Many new cards (including lots of T206s) and lower prices. 10% off all listed prices for Net54 members. Free shipping on orders over $300.00. Insurance extra. Checks and money orders only. No electronic payments. New York residents must add sales tax. As always, \"I'll take it\" takes precedence over ongoing negotiations.
