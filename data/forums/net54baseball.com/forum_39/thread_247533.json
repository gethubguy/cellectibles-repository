Centering is the most important factor overall.  \nPayPal F&F funds are at the ready.  \n\nHere's the list:\n\n[STRIKE]--Chief Bender  (w/ Trees)[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]--Mordecai Brown  (Chicago on Shirt)[/STRIKE]\n--D. Bush\n[STRIKE]--F. Chance  (Yellow[/STRIKE] & [STRIKE]Red Portrait[/STRIKE])\n--Eddie Collins\n--G. Gibson\n[STRIKE]--S. Hofman[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]--Joss  (Portrait[/STRIKE] & [STRIKE] Pitching[/STRIKE])\n[STRIKE]--Keeler  (Portrait)[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]--Magee  (Portrait)[/STRIKE]\n[STRIKE]--Marquard  (Portrait)[/STRIKE]\n--Mathewson  (Portrait)\n--McGraw  (No Cap, With Cap, Finger in Air, [STRIKE]Glove at Hip[/STRIKE])\n[STRIKE]--Matty McIntyre[/STRIKE]\n--Steinfeldt  (Portrait)\n[STRIKE]--Tinker  (Portrait)[/STRIKE]\n--Ed Walsh\n[STRIKE]--V.
