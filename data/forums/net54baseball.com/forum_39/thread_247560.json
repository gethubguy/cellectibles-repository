      "post_content": "On Saturday I will be scanning and documenting a new to the hobby collection of over 300 T206 cards. A few things to keep in mind regarding the cards that will be available for purchase:\r\n\r\nThere are no rare backs. Rarest backs would be a few Sovereign and EPDG cards.\r\n\r\nCondition runs the gamut from poor to EX. Majority would be good to VG/EX.\r\n\r\nCommons, stars, HOF, major HOF all available including all four Cobbs.\r\n\r\nThose who send me their wantlists will get right of first refusal on cards within the collection. You will also get scans and pricing before the cards are posted to Net54. The order that I receive the wantlists will be the order of preference on a card by card basis.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to state the condition that you are looking for. I don't want to hold a card in GD if you are only looking for EX or better.\r\n\r\nGreat opportunity to get your foot in the door on your needs from a new to market collection.\r\n\r\nTom C",
