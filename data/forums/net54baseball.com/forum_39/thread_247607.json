      "post_content": "I picked up this card in an auction with a larger group. It's graded PSA 7 (mc)\r\nbut I question the MC as there is white border showing all the way around although the top is slight. If is a Sweet Caporal on the back. PSA value is listed at $625 but will entertain any reasonable offer. Can provide picture upon request. I haven't been on in a while but I sold a large amount of T206, T205, and T3 cards several years back.\r\nYou can contact me at [url]smaddox660@aol.com[/url]",

      "post_content": "As these are your first two posts here, I\u2019m going to make an assumption that might not be correct, so I apologize if I\u2019m wrong. But just so you know, a qualifier like MC doesn\u2019t just take a little off the price of a card. A good rule of thumb is that it knocks down a card by two full grades. So a PSA 7 MC is gonna sell like a PSA 5. Maybe even less because there are very few people who like qualifiers. You may be looking at about 1/3rd of the price estimate without the qualifier. When you get in the higher grades, qualifiers can be even more damaging. For example, a PSA 9 with a qualifier of OC knocks off 95% of the value, at times. I\u2019d much rather take a PSA 6 of any card over a PSA 9 with a qualifier, personally.",

Nice sharp card for anyone interested but is rather oc to the top. But if you just like sharp cards this one is clean.",
