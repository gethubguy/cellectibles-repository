      "post_content": "I have had tremendous luck on the board the past couple of years.  Conner is now a freshman at Pitt and I am continuing the tradition of helping him build his T206 Pirate set at Christmas time.  I have been able to run down Howie Camitz, Vic Willis, Fred Clarke, and others on the board.  He is going to wait until he passes 20 million in net worth before he goes after the Wagner, but asked for a lower graded (2.5-4ish) versions of either or both of Nick Maddox and Dots Miller.  \r\n\r\nLet me know what you have and your price and hopefully we can work something out between now and Christmas.  And thanks as always!",
