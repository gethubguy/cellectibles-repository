      "post_content": "All,\n\nI'm wanting to buy two lower end graded Detroit Tigers in $25 range per card as part of my twin boys Xmas. I dabble in collecting modern cards, but truly envy the collectors of vintage cards and I want my kids to appreciate the history of the game. We're slowly covering players from this era and we've watched some of Ken Burns' history of baseball. However, there are a few guidelines and I'll take any recommendations you may have. \n\n1. Prefer SGC over PSA clear case because I believe they have a better presentation when displayed due to the solid color that surrounds the card allowing it to standout. \n\n2. Prefer two different players.\n\n3. Looking for good eye appeal with minimal paper loss on the front, since I'd like to display them in their room. \n\n4. Please post pictures or email me at [url]mikescott355@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n5. I'll consider raw if it's a deal I can't refuse. \n\n6. Finally, I'll respond to everyone, but I won't necessarily make a decision right away in order to field as many offers. \n\nPayPal f/f will be the form of payment. \n\nThanks in advance for your assistance!",
