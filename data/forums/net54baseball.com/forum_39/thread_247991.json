      "post_content": "Considering accepting trade offers for this incredible T206 Bates Proof. It's stunning- outstanding image quality, fat borders, etc. I love the card, just might want to refocus my attention back onto my first passion- rare backs and HOFers.\r\n\r\nI'd be looking for special/important rare backs (i.e. Drum, BL460, etc), HOFers with rare backs (Hindu or rarer), and/or higher grade Cobbs.\r\n\r\nFeel free to PM me with any trade proposals.\r\n\r\nThanks, and Happy Thanksgiving.\r\nMike",
