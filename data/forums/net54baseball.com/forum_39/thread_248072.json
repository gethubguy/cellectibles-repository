Suit your taste with either a PSA, SGC or BVG holder or mix and match or crack and cross.  Duffy is a little off on T/B centering, but all three are reasonably well centered L/R.  They all present aesthetically well for grades in the G-VG grade.\n\nAsking prices include shipping\n\nBENDER (Portrait)  -  $OLD \n\nBECKLEY - $OLD\n\n\nDUFFY - $SOLD\n\nALL NONE - $000  (just show your Net54 Membership card at checkout;))",
