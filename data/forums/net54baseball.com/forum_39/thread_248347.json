      "post_content": "I have quite a few scraps available for sale or I\u2019d trade generously for t204 or e107 HOFers....\r\n\r\nStahl SGC AUT BLANK BACK \u2013 Likely a unique card...I don\u2019t believe there are any other blank back Stahls in existance! Super clean back with no wrinkling wear on the card.  Card is in great overall condition! -- $1100\r\n\r\nStarr SGC AUT Triple Ghost image - Nice oversized, wavy border, card has a triple struck magenta image of Starr on front that\u2019s actually printed into the wide border! \u2013 $900\r\n\r\nBurns SGC AUT Wild Scrap \u2013 A lot went wrong with this one! Partial name at top... part of the next card\u2019s border is on front lower right.... reverse image way offset on right...oversized borders.  Some back damage too unfortunately.  A very unique and dramatic card! \u2013 $1100\r\n\r\nRossman SGC AUT - Huge strange high blue eyebrows due to a color pass missing it\u2019s mark.  It\u2019s also missing a separate color pass altogether and has uneven, oversized borders \u2013- $900\r\n\r\nMcLean SGC AUT \u2013 oversized wavy borders.  Very nice in terms of condition, very little wear or wrinkling \u2013 $225\r\n\r\nMarshall Scrap w/ a different card\u2019s background \u2013 The green background of the t206 Hunter somehow got printed upside down on this card!  Including a scan of a Hunter card for reference. Wavy oversized borders.  Very neat card with an extremely unique printing goof \u2013 $1100\r\n\r\nGanzel \u2013 Wavy uneven borders missing the orange and flesh colored color passes.  Notice the all-white skin!  Clear, sharp photo with vivid red coloring instead of the orange background \u2013 $900\r\n\r\nGriffith \u201cUnderprint\u201d - The Griffith was originally part of a puzzle that when put together displays an ad for Oaks Tobacco. On this example, you can see part of a hand, 2 sets of acorns and another symbol that were underprinted on the card\u2019s back before the actual card back was printed over the top of it. There are a few other examples out there however, this sort of an \"underprint\" does not come up too often. The 1909 tobacco ad for \"Oaks Tobacco\" was originally printed while t206's where printed at American litho in NYC. --- Asking $400\r\n\r\nI also have a Marquard Piedmont 350 PSA 3 available.  No creasing...mild touches to corners --- $140 [SOLD!!]\r\n\r\nScans are all below but let me know if you need others.  Thanks much!\r\n-Brian\r\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297303&d=1512322223[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297304&d=1512322231[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297305&d=1512322243[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297306&d=1512322276[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297307&d=1512322292[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297308&d=1512322300[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297309&d=1512322322[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=297310&d=1512322336[/IMG]",
