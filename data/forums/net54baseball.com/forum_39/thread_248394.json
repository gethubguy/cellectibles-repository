Couple of these are more difficult to come by.\r\n\r\nLooking for additional EPDG's I need or upgrades/downgrades to what I already have.  \r\n\r\nWill entertain any/all offers.  If buying, Paypal friends is preferred. Will also accept money orders.  Anyone saying \"I'll take it\" gets priority over ongoing negotiations. \r\n\r\n\r\n$SOLD Doolin portrait \r\n$SOLD Seymour batting \"5 corner\"\r\n$SOLD Maddox \r\n$SOLD Keeler portrait\r\n$SOLD Phillippe \r\n$TRADEDOakes \r\n$SOLD Tannehill PSA 1mk\r\n$SOLD Titus\r\n$SOLD Spade PSA 1.5 \r\n$SOLD Hofman\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4568/37949710235_7d4a0a700f_o.jpg[/IMG] \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4573/24964089808_b33abdf8be.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4582/24964088868_247a984376.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4559/24964087968_7ffb45ee16.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4559/24964086258_209abd6713.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4530/24964085378_7f71d72bde.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4570/24964084108_8f01c5c308_b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4549/24964082898_c06f1d7aab.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4574/38836608831_2c719aec80_b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4529/38836604981_9327c5f2b4.jpg[/IMG]",
