McGinnity probably has the brightest red of any card I've owned.\n\nPrices includes shipping and insurance.  Prices are firm.  Paypal f/f.\n\nJoss $606 SOLD\nMcGinnity $606\nMathewson portrait SGC 50 $1075\nJohnson $1300\nMathewson portrait SGC A (not trimmed in the typical sense, hand-cut with huge borders - crease-free) $606\nCobb PSA 2 (has a few minor issues, but no creases and very nice eye appeal) $1450\nMathewson Dark Cap PSA 4.5 $1250",
