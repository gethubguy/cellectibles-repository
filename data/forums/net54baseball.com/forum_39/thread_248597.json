      "post_content": "CARD HAS SOLD - Thank you to all who reached out.\n\nKey card has tremendous eye appeal despite flaws that warrant a technical \"Auth\" encapsulation by SGC. There is mounting residue on the back and a crease at lower left. This crease does break the surface a very little bit but does not have overwhelming effect when viewing card from the front (in my opinion it is slightly more noticeable from the back). I am unaware if SGC may have thought the card trimmed as well (though I can not imagine someone going to that effort given pre existing flaws). \n\nI apologize for the cell phone images but my scanner does not allow for good images of cards in holders. \n\n\nFirst \"I will take it\" post gets it or feel free to PM me as I am happy to entertain any offers.\n\nThank you!",
