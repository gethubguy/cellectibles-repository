Would be interested in any EPDGs you have in any condition or basic commons to upgrade my Set.\r\n\r\nIf buying, shipping is included and paypal friends is preferred as well as money order/cashiers check with shipment on receipt of payment. I will always listen to offers, especially if interested in more than 1, however anyone saying \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d gets priority over negotiations.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\n$SOLD Jack Barry SGC 70\r\n$SOLD Charlie Starr SGC 60\r\n$SOLD Boss Schmidt Portrait SGC 55\r\n$SOLD Jack Hannifan SGC 55\r\n$SOLD Monte Cross SGC 55\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4560/38922356032_c3c7c52e23.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4641/27181511759_94ae45124f.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4636/27181502269_d1aa29bfa1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4577/27181492119_7db10abf94.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4552/27181483859_1c5e2d6024.jpg[/IMG]",
