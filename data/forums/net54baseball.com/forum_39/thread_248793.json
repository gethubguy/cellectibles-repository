I recall an auction offering a batch of around 200 at one time. I am not sure if the new owner is a member here but if so I would love to discuss acquiring some copies.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has clean copies of Bill's book available please feel free to pm me or email me [url]t206society@gmail.com[/url].\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
