      "post_content": "I received a gift of cash for Christmas that was earmarked for baseball cards.  As my mother-in-law recognizes my passion, but has no idea how to buy cards.  I am hoping that I can put it to good use in acquiring a T206 Nap Lajoie w/bat card for my collection.\r\n\r\n I do not care what back it has.  I generally prefer non-creased cards, but if the price is right I will consider any condition.  I collect both graded and ungraded cards.\r\n\r\nWhat does Net54 have available?  Feel free to contact me anyway you wish.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRich",
