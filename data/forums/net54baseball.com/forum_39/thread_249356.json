      "post_content": "SGC 10 Lajoie with Brown Hindu back. This card has a nice looking front, however some paper loss and markings on the reverse. I would like to trade this for some PSA only EPDG cards. PSA 2-3 range, or a higher grade if it matches up with this card value wise. Please let me know if there is any interest in trading.\r\n\r\nSent to Ebay.  \r\n\r\nThanks.[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=300211&d=1514423332[/IMG]",
