      "post_content": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI'm about 35 cards into a collector grade raw T206 set. I'm looking to buy raw cards in equivalent to PSA 2-4 (G-VG/EX) condition, and I'd be happy to buy bulk.  Front image is what matters most, back damage is ok if it's not horrible. I'm not right now collecting rare backs, but I'm willing to listen. I need just about everything at the moment, so don't be afraid to ask if you're looking to unload!\r\n\r\nemail is best: sethgbernard @ gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks and happy new year,\r\nSeth",
