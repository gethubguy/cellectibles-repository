      "post_content": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm looking to add some BL 350s.  I've bought a few lately, so I think I am \"paying strong\".  For the BLs, I prefer a nice looking GD-VG card, but I am interested in pretty much any.  \r\n\r\nActual grades don't matter too much to me, I'm an eye appeal guy.  I'm not interested in any cards with paper loss on the back, unless it doesn't affect any text.  I have a couple very low grade Uzits that I'd be happy to do a cash plus trade for a nicer copy if that interest anyone.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to pay at least market prices, so if you have something that you're thinking of consigning somewhere, maybe we can make a deal and save you the juice.\r\n\r\n[url]lukealyon@gmail.com[/url]",
