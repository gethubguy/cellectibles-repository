      "post_content": "Greetings Friends,\r\n\r\nUp for your consideration are two T206 beaters. The price will be $SOLD22 (for the pair) if you use Paypal FF and are okay with me shipping the cards in a plain white envelope (and you trust the USPS to deliver that envelope). If you want, you can add $4 if you want a tracking number and want to use the regular Paypal option.\r\n\r\nThe Thomas card is in okay shape, no major paper loss but plenty of creases. The Shaw card has a scrapped back and is in poor condition.\r\n\r\nCards will be available until I post that they have been sold. I'm super quick with updating my for sale posts.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of good trading and selling references if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9aKU3bLluX8/WlosMMzyjQI/AAAAAAAABd4/W0jM5EB4M-IxYaY85TPAPvWzSSZlL0KbwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_1964.JPG[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XUTPQBUuUHw/WlosKwtRRPI/AAAAAAAABd0/x4rpoRI2ij8qE7_5j2mtLt_N5NP5yuLCwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_1963.JPG[/IMG]",
