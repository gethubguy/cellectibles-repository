      "post_content": "Hi Folks, I have not done much posting but am an active card collector.  I have been concentrating on PSA graded 1934/36 Diamond Stars and some other sets.  I am just now starting to again purchase PSA graded T206s (in PSA 2 to 4).  I am starting to focus on a subset, that being Portraits.  In fact, there is a category of T206 Portraits on the PSA Set Registry that will be participating in.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to say hi.  I will be spending more time on this forum, listening to other participant's expertise, and looking for opportunities to add to my collection.",
