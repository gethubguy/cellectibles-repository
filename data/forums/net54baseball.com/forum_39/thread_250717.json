The price will be $19SOLD (for the pair) if you use Paypal FF and are okay with me shipping the cards in a plain white envelope (and you trust the USPS to deliver that envelope). That said, you can add $4 if you want a tracking number and want to use the regular Paypal option.\r\n\r\nCards are in poor/trimmed shape.\r\n\r\nCards will be available until I post that they have been sold. I'm super quick with updating my for sale posts.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of good trading and selling references if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i59A6G1pblA/Wm-tEsVNOhI/AAAAAAAABes/lAt0KUfNi786ZGl5kPFWr0QPUnhnR7EJQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_1975.JPG[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r1MuyOCAqsw/Wm-tEuCGIVI/AAAAAAAABew/8AIIIcvQ_W4cy7jUFAC3EWe7sBjbWMllgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_1976.JPG[/IMG]",
