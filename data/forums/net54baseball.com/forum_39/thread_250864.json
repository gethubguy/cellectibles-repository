If I am going to spend the money, I prefer something nice 1.5+ - 4.0, PSA or SGC only.  Would be an all cash deal.  Thanks\r\n\r\nRyan Hotchkiss\r\n[url]rhotchkiss@horizonlandco.com[/url]",

I was under bidder on the 1.5 that sold late last year in REA but couldn't get over the writing on back to pull that next bid. I would like a very nice example, bc if I am going to spend the money I mind as well pay more and be thrilled",
