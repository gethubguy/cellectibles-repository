These are very tough to find with this back as stated in the Elite Eleven threads.\n\nLooking to trade for EPDG's or HOFer upgrades.  \n\nPricing them at $290 and $190\n\nThanks......\n\n\n\nLink for Bigger Front Scan\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4661/39953345232_b8e86a5f8e_o.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4661/39953345232_9def0d69be.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLink for Bigger Back Scan\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4704/39086814655_2795995359_o.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4704/39086814655_09c1cc674e.jpg[/IMG]",
