Propose Your Own Deal.\r\n\r\nTwo cards remain.  \r\n\r\nCard #2 - Lou Ritter PSA 4.5 \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/duplicates/58114/ritter[/IMG]\r\n\r\nCard #3 - Johnny Evers (Portrait) SGC A.  The reverse features an unusual \"3\".  Is it a 3 over a \"missing\" 3 or a 3 over a \"missing\" 1 or is it simply a \"50 Subjects\" card?  What a conversation piece to add to your collection.  If you like \"well-loved\" cards, this one is for you.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10041/evers-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAll card(s) are shipped free of charge as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you don\u2019t want the cards, you can BYOB.:D\r\n\r\nWhen we finish the bottle, make an offer.\r\n\r\nEven ridiculous offers will be considered.",
