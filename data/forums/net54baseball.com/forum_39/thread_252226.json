Or any T206 Drum + cash for you.  Or equivalent value in raw vg/ex or better T206 cards that I need. .\n\nAvailable FS at $2700 OBO\n\nGlove at hip pose.\n\nScans are available upon request.  It presents like a strong \u201c5\u201d but does have a spot of staining on the top border which probably accounts for a slightly lessor grade.",
