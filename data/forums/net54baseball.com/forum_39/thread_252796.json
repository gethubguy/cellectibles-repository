      "post_content": "Hi everyone, currently I'm looking to add the following T206 Old Mill Backs to my personal set. I'm looking for lower grade raw or PSA/SGC 1\u2019s to 3\u2019s that have very little or no paper loss, untrimmed, and no ink marks. Just looking for good honest wear. Higher grades are fine if the price is right. You can PM me and or send me an email with scans and prices at [url]d2ad2a@aol.com[/url]  I\u2019m aware that some of these cards are currently listed for sale on Ebay but are way over priced. This list of Old Mill cards are actually from the more common print runs that tend to have higher populations.\n\nThanks in advance for everyone\u2019s help. I\u2019m starting with this list of 41 cards.\nI don\u2019t have much for trading except for a few Sweet Caporal 350-460 Factory 30 \u201cNo Print\u201d Scraps. I sell common players for $1000 and HOF\u2019ers at $1400. If your interested in a list of what I currently have available, just ask, or you can look at high quality front & back scans at [URL=\"http://www.comicplace.com/t206noprints/t206.html\"]T206 No Prints[/URL]. Most of the time I make purchases using PayPal Friend\u2019s & Family.\n\nOld Mill Backs Only\n\n\nFrank \u201cHome Run\u201d Baker \nGeorge Bell - Pitching follow thru\nChief Bender - No trees in background\nBill Bergen - Catching\nBob Bescher - Hands in air\nGeorge Brown - Browne, Washington\nMordecai Brown - Chicago on shirt\nDonnie Bush\nHowie Camnitz - Arms at side\nHowie Camnitz - Hands over head\nFrank Chance - Batting\nMike Donlin - With bat\nTed Easterly\nJerry Freeman\nHarry Gasper\nSolly Hofman\nHarry Howell - Hands at waist\nJimmy Jackson\nAddie Joss - Pitching\nJoe Kelley\nRed Kleinow - Boston\nHarry Krause - Portrait\nLefty Leifield - Batting\nPaddy Livingstone\nRube Marquard - Pitching follow thru\nHarry McIntyre - Brooklyn & Chicago\nGeorge Mullin - With bat\nRed Murray - Portrait\nTom Needham\nFred Payne\nBob Rhoades - Right arm extended\nGermany Schaefer - Washington\nFrank Smith - Chicago & Boston\nOscar Stanage\nJeff Sweeney - New York, fielding\nIra Thomas\nJoe Tinker - Bat off shoulder\nJoe Tinker - Bat on shoulder\nVic Willis - Throwing\nOwen Wilson",
