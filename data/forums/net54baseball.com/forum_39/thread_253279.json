      "post_content": "I always like looking at these color variation scraps and plan to add some to my collection at some point. I don't have much to trade and cash is tight right now. I only have the SC 350-460 Factory 30 Full Color No Print Scraps to trade. It only makes sense for me to collect the yellow/browns since they were on one sheet and the color one's that I have were on the other sheet. It may have even been the same person that took both of the sheets from the print shop and cut them into singles. All I can do is fantasize of the many possibilities that these cards took to get where they are today.",
