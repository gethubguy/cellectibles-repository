      "post_content": "Jim Delehanty T206 scrap missing red ink and oversized/hand cut. For comparison, I've put it up near a regular Delehanty from the set (regular card on left not included). Card has a clean Piedmont 350 back with no paper loss or writing.\n\nI've called this a 'zombie' card. Interesting thing is that while it is missing red on most of the card, a concentrated area of red is on the left side of his face. I've seen cards missing red ink entirely and others missing some. Haven't seen many with large splotches like this in only certain areas.\n\nThis is the only picture I have on me at the moment but will be happy to email/show a back scan to interested parties once I can.\n\n$250 shipped via Paypal net to me.",
