I'm not in a hurry to make a decision.  \r\n\r\nThank you all for the interest, I will keep everyone in mind that has messaged me.  I don't really know what's so strange about this offer, it's just another trade for assets, same as someone asking to trade a Ty Cobb for a Babe Ruth.  He can obviously sell the Ty Cobb and go buy a Ruth, but it's also fun and rewarding to wait and see what you may be offered.  I would be honored to have the strangest post here.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThe concept isn't strange..but the chances of someone on this board having land for sale in that area are extremely low.  By selling the cards, you would at least have the cash on hand to go towards any plot of land you wanted.  Regardless, good luck on your search and your card collection is very nice.",
