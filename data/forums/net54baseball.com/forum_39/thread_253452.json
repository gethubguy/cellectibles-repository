      "post_content": "I am looking to buy or trade for the following T206's with other than Piedmont or Sweet Caporal Backs.  Evers Cubs Shirt, Lajoie Portrait, Keeler Portrait, Mathewson Portrait, Tinker Portrait  and Speaker. Prefer graded cards in PSA 4 or 5. I will consider nicer looking SGC examples . Polar Bear , Sovereign or other semi rare or rare backs are of interest. I can either pay $ or trade other T206's or tobacco era cards of interest. \r\n\r\nOthers of somewhat lesser interest that I would like for upgrades (currently owned in PSA 3)  are Brown Portrait, Brown Cubs Shirt, Jennings Portrait,  Marquard Portrait, Joss Portrait, Waddell Portrait\r\nThanks for looking.",
