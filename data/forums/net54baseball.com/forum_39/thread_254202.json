Raw and clean are the only real requirements, but if I am to be picky:\r\n\r\nNo writing, stamps, missing pieces, or any other major flaws. Pinholes and minor paper loss are OK but not preferred. Graded is fine, but I am cracking them. \r\n\r\nScans or pics are a must. \r\n\r\nHere is what is left:\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty 350\r\nCarolina Brights\r\nCycle 350\r\nDrum 350\r\nTolstoi\r\n\r\nI realize these are not cheap nor easy, but I am looking, ready, willing, and able!\r\n\r\nJ.R.",
