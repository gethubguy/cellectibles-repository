There has been two huge Master collectors in the past several years who are close on completion, one has been Hall who is out of the picture, and has been for a few years, this has accounted for stupid prices of backs. The other I will not name, but he is also much more reserved in crazy pricing..\n...It sounds like you are trying to set the table for your backs??? Could it be?",
