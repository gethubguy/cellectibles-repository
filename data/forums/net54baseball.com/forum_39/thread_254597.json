I do not sell many cards and don't have access to any price guides, so I am not really sure of a good asking price.  That being said...eBay has some comps (but not exact) so I am asking [strike]$old [/strike] now $old delivered.  Please PM me if interested....I will consider all reasonable offers so don't be shy.  \n\nThanks,\n\nJeff",
