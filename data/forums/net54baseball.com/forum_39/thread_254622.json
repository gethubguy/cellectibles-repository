If not, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s the first.....I\u2019m ok with keeping the card if a deal isn\u2019t there......\r\n\r\nCard is crosslisted on eBay too. If you need any references, just let me know and I\u2019ll point you there.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm1.staticflickr.com/971/40088722210_eb7b16d67d_o.jpg[/IMG]",
