However, I LOVE my portraits as Sov.150s.  So, if anyone has a Sov.150, and would like to TRADE * for my corresponding 350, let me know.  I can take a slight condition drop or even add some $$$.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=315064&d=1525718914[/IMG]\r\n\r\n* Just to reiterate:  These are ONLY for TRADE --- NOT for Sale.\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott",
