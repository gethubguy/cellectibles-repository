That ends tomorrow night. Also have this low-grade Sovereign for the people who asked about backs. I'd sell it for $30 (the black mark on the side is just on the outside of the plastic holder). Nothing else for Thielman besides these four cards and the one in the auction (except 3-4 beaters if anyone needs a filler cheap, I'll dig them out)",
