This is only one of two graded SCap 350 fact. 25 back of ALL grades according to PSA Pops report, extremely rare because this is a fairly high populated HOFer....Card is pretty well centered with slightly rounded corners, extremely clean back and presents extremely well. I can send pics to whoever needs them, going to sell it quick this weekend....First $350 gets it, thanks...",
