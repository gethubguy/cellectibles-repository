A guy lists a card on the BST with no intention of selling it, nor does he give a price, he indicates initially that he is fishing for an offer.....I offer a suggested price of what I think the market is, and that figure  is $10,000 higher than PSA SMR price for a PSA 6?

Answer, never, you stupid idiot....You dont have a freaking clue...I have no idea what's up Hotchkiss's Ass, but I was being helpful I thought....PSA SMR price for a 6 is $22,000, and I still stand by what I thought the card will bring...How is that a violation?",
