      "post_content": "So, I picked up both of these cards randomly (separate from each other), but it's clear they were once part of the same collection.  The year, position and non-ball point pen suggest that they are partners.  Does anyone out there have any cards similar to these?  In the spirit of Ed's \"Howe McCormack\" collection, I'd like to reunite some of these cards.  Please let me know if you have any similar cards (even if you don't want to part with them).\r\n\r\nthanks!",
