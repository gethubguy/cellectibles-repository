My photo skills are also a bit lacking as the card is positioned with the shorter cut side a bit under the the plastic interior which makes it look more OC. The four corners are very very nice, no creases, chipping, or other marks on a 110 yr old card. I've been happy with while Ive owned it, but I am a collector and have made some other upgrades in my collection hence the sale of this and a few others.",
