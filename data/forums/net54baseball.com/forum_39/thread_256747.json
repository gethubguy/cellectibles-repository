      "post_content": "A few years ago I was excited about purchasing my first T206 card (Christy Mathewson) even I'm an autograph guy, but unfortunately just never had the time to pursue the purchasing of more, so I putting this one up for sale.\r\n\r\nI'd rather it be in the possession of someone who will cherish it.\r\n\r\nI think I paid $39.00 for this, so that's what I am asking.  I have no idea what it's worth/value is in the condition it is in.  I have to say it is a cool card to own.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPayPal via FF please and shipping is Free.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if anyone wants it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=321044&d=1530040619[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=321045&d=1530040629[/IMG]",
