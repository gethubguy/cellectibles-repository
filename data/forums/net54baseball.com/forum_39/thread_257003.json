      "post_content": "Hi everyone- I'm looking to buy or trade for any mid grade T206 Mordecai Brown. Pose doesn't matter, card back doesn't matter, no preference in grader other than SGC/BVG/PSA.  Most important thing is that the card be a clean 4/5\r\nrange example. I have good trade material, or can buy, or can do a combo of cards and cash. Send me a PM and we will go from there!",
