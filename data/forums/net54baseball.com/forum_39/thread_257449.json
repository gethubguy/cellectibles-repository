If something catches you're eye, maybe we can work something out with better prices, of course :).\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nLink usually doesn't work, but got to try:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.ebay.com/sch/sg713/m.html?item=372357805393&hash=item56b2413551%3Ag%3APyUAAOSwNOJbPTvj&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2562[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott",
