      "post_content": "I think this is a pretty cool baseball and it's the only one I have ever seen, not to say that it's the only one in existence though. But Red Murray was a great outfielder. It's a Spalding baseball from 1947-1951 according to JSA. The signature is very light-faded over time-but still readable, and it is signed John Red Murray. It drew a a lot of attention at the show when I went to have it authenticated. Having a single signed baseball from a player from the deadball era is tough in my opinion, but having one of the caliber of Red Murray has to be rare. Also included is a book/pamphlet called \"Playing The Game With Red Murray\". Also included are 2 different T206's of Red both graded PSA 2.5. The price is 300.00 PayPal f/f delivered. Thanks for looking and if you have any additional info you want to add or just think I'm an idiot, feel free to let me know. Thanks for reading and looking.\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=323713&d=1532379323[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=323714&d=1532379337[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=323715&d=1532379360[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=323716&d=1532379378[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=323717&d=1532379402[/IMG]",
