And since there is no official rule regarding removing prices from the bst I feel there should also be no rule against quoting listings so prices can't later be deleted.  Not a huge deal I suppose, but I just find it annoying when asking prices get deleted and felt Jake was helping out the community by making sure that information stayed available.",
