They're really are hard to see.  \r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I bought this card graded a 1-2 (I can't remember, but it was low grade) from another board member because it appeared to have major paper loss on the back.  Once it arrived, I realized it was actually paper residue, not paper loss, so I cracked it out and soaked it (just plain water).  No paper loss at all.\r\n\r\n$45 OBO delivered PP gift (or add 3% for regular PP).",
