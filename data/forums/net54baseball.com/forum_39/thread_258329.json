The second scan shows the scrap card alongside my Carolina Brights.  The CB is just shown for the sake of comparison, it is not included.  Both scans were taken with the same scanner and settings.  It shows the missing colors pretty well.  The red blob by his hands is pretty cool.\r\n\r\n$500\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
