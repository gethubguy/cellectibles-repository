      "post_content": "The back story on these is that 80 hand-cut Polar Bears recently showed up at auction.  To my knowledge, these are the first Polar Bear Printer's Scrap cards that have been found.  A friend bought 44 of them, and I bought them from him.  I tried to fit them back together like a puzzle.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to.  As a result, I feel less need to keep them together, so I'm not going to keep them all.\n\nThe first scans are cards for sale, and the others are pics of the group of 80 as a whole.\n\nShipping is $3 regardless of how many you want\n\nKroh $58 SOLD\nWhite $68 SOLD \nRhodes $58 SOLD\nHoward $58  SOLD\n\nLavender $48 SOLD\nRitter $42 SOLD\nLaporte $52 SOLD\nLivingstone $38\n\nTitus (Now in SGC A holder) $300\nMoran $42  SOLD\nRaymond $44\nMcGlynn $46\n\nPerring $40\nRandall $42\nStrang $42\nPhelps $42\n\nKrause Portrait $46\nKrause Throwing $42\nO'Brien $46\nStanage $42\n\nSnodgrass $46  SOLD\nSlagle $39\nRudolph $39\nLord $39",
