I am almost positive there was a picture of a PSA 3 and your description said 3.5. Rather than changing the description to jive with the pic that was up there, there is now a pic of a 3.5 - I am sure it is the same card, just maybe a changed flip? Please clarify, did you used to have a pic up of that Cobb in a PSA 3 and now it shows 3.5, and if so, how?  Your reply seems to imply that was the case and that is my recollection.  Just trying to understand as someone who was interested in the card.\r\n\r\nRyan",
