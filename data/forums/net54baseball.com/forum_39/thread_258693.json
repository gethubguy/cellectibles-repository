Kinda wishful thinking and kinda territorial. I've seen it a lot recently. I don't like it when I'm a seller as it seems meant to chase away other potential buyers. I've had users post this and then low ball me. More than once. Just my own experience. I have no horse in this race.",

I see no issue here.....That is what I would say too. How could you possibly be doing anything wrong. If it is already sold the seller will let you know and if not, then you get it at the price offered.  Nice card, btw...\n\nAnd if a buyer does post \"sold\" and then offers anything other than the asking price.....Please PM me.....It won't happen again or they will get booted, if they don't get the boot the first time. No games here...",
