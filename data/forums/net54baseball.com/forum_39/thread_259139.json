I believe this card is trimmed, but I could be wrong and I will leave you to judge by the photographs. Besides that issue, this card has a small tear on the bottom through the second \"c\" in \"Cincinnati\" that goes up to the end of the border and a couple of spots of paper loss on Griffith's jersey. Still holds great eye appeal and is one of the best looking Griffiths I have seen.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=326832&d=1535166755[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=326833&d=1535166781[/IMG]\n\nIf you would like better/ more detailed scans just ask. Thank you.",
