But I'd be good for $30 towards whatever the bid might be just for the Jordan. Let me know if you are interested, or if you're bidding and I won't bid again.

There is a great looking 1933 Goudey Ruth on the bay with heavy, clear glue on the back. I shy away from both. So count me as a nay vote. :cool:",
