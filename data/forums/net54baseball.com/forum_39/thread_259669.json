A police report was filed with local police and the USPS insurance claim was filed and denied, then appealed and denied again. \n\nSome of you may have seen my post(s)about these cards on other social media, but I figure it\u2019s worth a shot to post them here. \n\nNone of the LCS guys near me in MD have seen them. I haven\u2019t seen them pop up for sale anywhere. Let me know if they look familiar or if you see them. \n\nThanks.\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/a1d0d96d4487432a8c7a42e71c589809.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/4d175af8967eb96d9877e38111ab639e.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/c7c0e872cab745b6203104686e0e7e4a.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/37fc908055e691fc078f38491b5d0919.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/2aa8ad81d78e5c9fef704dfe95408ce9.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180906/46c7bdd866401c354c5e25c861d0cd22.png[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
