I will list the rest here later but for now I have close to 400 commons that I would like to sell. Instead of listing all 400 here I would like to help people fill their lists. Send me a pm with your list and your email and I will let you know what I have. Most of the cards are lower grade. So this is a great way to help get your Monster number up for less money. Mostly commons but some HOF and a couple lower grade variations. \r\nThanks!\r\nEric",
