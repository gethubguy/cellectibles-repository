      "post_content": "SALE PENDING!       Ok. So I owe some apologies for posting and asking everyone for lists. Turns out most of what people wanted was not what I had and would rather sell as a lot than breaking up individually. Quite honestly I don\u2019t have the time to sell 1 or 2 at a time. So here is the breakdown:\r\nSo here it is. I am not great at pricing but would rather sell to you as a group than spend a ton of time selling one by one. \r\n\r\nFirst- this is the list of the cards that are NOT in the lot-\r\nAll cards present in 524 card set except for\r\nAdkins\r\nBresnahan portrait\r\nBrown Chicago\r\nChance bat\r\nAll Ty Cobbs\r\nDemmitt St. Louis\r\nDoyle variation\r\nGandil\r\nJohnson portrait\r\nJohnson pitching\r\nJoss portrait\r\nLajoie throw\r\nLajoie bat\r\nMagie\r\nMathewson dark and light cap\r\nMcgraw portrait no cap\r\nOhara St. Louis\r\nPlank\r\nSpeaker\r\nTinker hands knees\r\nWaddell throw\r\nHonus Wagner\r\nWalsh\r\nWheat\r\nYoung glove shows\r\nYoung bare hand\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 422 commons (28 duplicates), they are all over the place condition wise. Lots of good, lots of fair, some poor. I would put these at 24 each. 422x24=10128\r\nI have a complete set of 48 SLers. Same thing condition wise. I looked on eBay and the low grade raw sell for 60-100 each. \r\nI was thinking 50each. 48x50=2400\r\nI have 51 HOFers. They are all over the place as well but include a top border trimmed Cy Young portrait and a Mathewson portrait. I would go $50 each on these. 51x50, call it 2550\r\n\r\n10128+2400+2550=15078 so 15k would be the starting point. Payment by PayPal f and f or check. \r\n\r\nI have some pics I can send to give an idea of condition. Please pm me your email and I will send some pics. \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions you have. \r\nThanks for looking\r\nEric",
