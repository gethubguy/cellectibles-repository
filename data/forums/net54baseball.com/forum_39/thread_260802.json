      "post_content": "Trimmed Cobb with black ink added around the border on the front. No creases/wrinkles. Super nice looking card that would look great in a binder set. The last scan with Cobb in a group is just to show that the black ink around the border doesn't stand out too much and isn't distracting (imo at least).\n\nI sent this to SGC hoping to get it into a SGC A holder, but they deemed it \"excessively altered\" because of the added ink and trimming.\n\n$1060 shipped and insured PRICE DROP TO $910. Price assumes a \"no fee\" payment method. Paypal Goods is fine if you add 3% to the total. Price is firm.",
