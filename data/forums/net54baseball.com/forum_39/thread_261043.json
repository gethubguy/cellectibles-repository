      "post_content": "SOLD  I am looking to sell (SOLD) or trade these T206. For trade I would be looking for a Cardinal T-card or cards for my collection. Centering and eye appeal are more important than technical grade but I am looking for graded cards. Minor paper loss or writing on the back is okay. I am willing to add some cash to the deal if necessary. Let me know what you have if you are interested or if you have any questions. \n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/cwazzy/cardinals-t206/36781/t206-bobby-byrne[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/cwazzy/cardinals-t206/36783/t206-steve-evans[/IMG]",
