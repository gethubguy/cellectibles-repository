I see various things on miscuts etc., but wanted to see if anyone had heard of this type of upside down back?\r\n\r\nAlthough it is in poor condition is anyone aware of people who might be interested in the card?  I am not focused on miscuts and have a higher condition Durham in my collection.\r\n\r\nThanks all.\r\n\r\nSeth",
