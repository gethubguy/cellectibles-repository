      "post_content": "I'm putting together a HOF set of T206 (Minus Wagner and Plank), looking to have at least one of each of the other 36 players.  Cobb, Matty, WaJo and Eddie Collins are my last 4.  I know I can simply get them from eBay, but if any board member is looking to upgrade their collections I'd love to hear some offers.  Any of the poses are fine, I'd prefer common backs (not a rare back collector).  PM me if you are interested in selling.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
