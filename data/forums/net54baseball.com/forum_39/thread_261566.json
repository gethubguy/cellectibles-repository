      "post_content": "VCP: $2830 off of two recent sales @ $2828 and $2833\r\n\r\nAsking $2375 goods / $2300 FF  price is firm.  \r\n\r\nClean 150 series with bright color and stunning registration. No creases or wrinkles.  This one is short. I don't know if it's factory short or trimmed as it's not designated as altered, but I'll assume the latter. You can't find anything higher than a beater for this price and this card can sit in a display and present like a stunner.  Some paper loss on the back side, as seen in the pics.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1099/3990/products/cobb2_1024x1024.png?v=1541082115[/IMG]",
