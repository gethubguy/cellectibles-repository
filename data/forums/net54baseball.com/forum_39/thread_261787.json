      "post_content": "Fellow Net54ers,\n\nI have a Marquard with uniform lettering \"reverse comma\" variation. This is an interesting printing anomaly where the period between the N and Y is formed as a reverse comma. $615 delivered USPS with signature confirmation.\n\nI also have a Speaker that has very nice color and great centering. The grade is due to spot paper loss/damage on the reverse. **SOLD**\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions. Thanks for the interest.",
