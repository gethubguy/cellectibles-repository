The Jennings and McGraw were purchased from another board member who I won't name since he is a collector and not a dealer.  However, I will say that member informed me that he purchased the cards at a card show in the late 1980s at a time when forging T206 cards wouldn't have been profitable.  \r\n\r\nIf any of these three pass authentication, then this asking price will look like an absolute steal.  I would resubmit myself, but I'm out of the game and I'd rather not jump back in.  This could be a bargain for anyone who is inclined to gamble a bit.  If no one wants to pay $3,000, I'll put them back in the safe where they have been stored.  Thank you for looking.\r\n\r\nJason",

      "post_content": "As a former owner of the Cicotte, I got the card in probably 2010 - best guess from memory, but it wasn't a quick flip to Jason.  The person I received it from is someone I have known since I was a young kid, and his general focus in pre-1950 baseball cards, and not autographs per se.  I recall the Cicotte being in his collection for many years prior to my acquiring it.",

I\"d have to believe that if those were purchased in the 80s then that has got to be a positive.  Pretty sure that any TPG would be afraid to authenticate either the McGraw or the Jennings just due to the fact that the year of death for both was such a long time ago.  I honestly like the way the Jennings looks.",
