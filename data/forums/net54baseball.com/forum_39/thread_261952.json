      "post_content": "Hello everyone. While this may be slightly vague, I am interested in acquiring some Hall of Fame portrait cards should anyone have interest in parting with any. Further, common players with interesting backs are also of interest. \r\n\r\nI am interested in cards which are lower to mid grade (2-4 range) with respectable eye appeal. \r\n\r\nSome of the players I covet would be Lajoie, Eddie Collins, Speaker (not a portrait, I know), Matty, Walsh, Chance, Evers, Tinker, Chesbro, Bender and other similar studs.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to share possible options and imagery with me please feel free to do so via email at [url]t206society@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek",

      "post_content": "Yes Sir! I am interested in most HOF ... though I will not be going after the lower end gents at this time nor do I have the funds to go for a green Cobb. Everything in between would be of some interest assuming a respectable eye appeal. Further, commons are nice if they have an interesting back as well.\r\n\r\nShould you have any you would like to chat about I will be happy to.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nDerek",
