      "post_content": "Hello friends,\n\nI\u2019m a set builder looking for beaters. No condition is too crummy. Interested in commons and stars. Can buy singles or lots. I also have some T206 dupes as well as some other possible trade bait. \n\nI personally don\u2019t place a higher value on graded cards or rare backs.\n\nBelow is my Have list (eg cards I already have from the set). I\u2019m fine accumulating dupes if they\u2019re part of a larger lot.\n\nThanks!\nDavid\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nHave list:\n\nAbbaticchio (blue sleeves), Abbaticchio (brown sleeves), Abbott, Abstein, Ames (hands above head), Anderson, Armbruster, Arellanes, Ball (Cle.), Barbereau, Barry (Mil.), Bastian, Batch, Bates, Beck, Becker, Bergen (w/ glove), Bescher (Portrait), Blackburne, Bowerman, Bradley (with bat), Bransfield, Bresnahan (portrait), Bridwell (no cap), Bridwell (w/ cap), Geo.
