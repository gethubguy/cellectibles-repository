No creases.  Nice American Beauty back and centered well front and back.\nAsking $OLD to add this to your collection.\n\nDoyle has a little crease in the left upper corner and slightly more rounded corners than Snodgrass.  The Tolstoi back is nice with no paper loss and is also well centered.  Asking $69 to add a very presentable Tolstoi to your hoard.\n\nBoth prices are net to me and include shipping.\n\nWhat's not to like?  If they are still available in 48 hours, shoot me an offer.",
