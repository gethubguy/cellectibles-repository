      "post_content": "FS is a Cy Young Portrait Graded SGC A.  Please note that the person who sold it to me bought it at the 2017 National in a PSA 4 holder.  This was verified by a Heritage employee -- whom I spoke to directly -- who suggested to the original owner that it may be under-graded/was worth a try in getting graded again.  It was submitted to SGC and graded a SGC A.  I can't predict what will happen if it were re-submitted but at the very least it's an A with great eye appeal.\r\n\r\nPrice is firm at X with PayPal Friends & Family or X regular PayPal.  I'm happy to provide multiple references, including auction house owners and Net54 members.\r\n\r\nPM me with any questions.  \"I'll take it\" takes precedent.\r\n\r\n[SOLD]",
