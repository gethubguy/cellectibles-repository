      "post_content": "As most T206 collectors know, the Doyle: wind-up card is a scarce common. I  purchased this example at last weekend\u2019s Philly Show (from a respected Net54 member) for [STRIKE]$50[/STRIKE]. When I got home I realized that I already had it in my low-grade set, and in delightfully worse condition than this one.\r\n\r\nThe card is SOLD. Shipping is $1 PWE.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please email, NO PMs: [url]mpeich12@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nCheers, Mike",
