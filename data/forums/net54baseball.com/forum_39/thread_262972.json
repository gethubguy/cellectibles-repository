      "post_content": "I had originally purchased this card to show my wife's family as they all grew up in the town in which Carl Lundgren lived and is now buried. They all played on the baseball field in Marengo, Illinois that is named for Mr. Lundgren and even some of the older family members meeting him when they were but small youngsters. Everyone thought the card was cool but being non-collectors, it wasnt wow..gotta have it cool. NOw if it was the card that showed him in a Chicago Cubs uniform, I believe this would have been another story. So here I am selling it back to the gotta have it cool crowd. \r\n\r\nThis is a great looking card that presents well and to my naked eye, I do not see any creases but rather corner issues being the main culprit for the PSA 2 grade. I am looking for $50.00 OBO with postage paid by myself with this card. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking and please let me know if you have any questions.",
