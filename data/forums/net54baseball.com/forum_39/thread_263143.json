I can't tell if it's green or green apple or what have you, but there's a nice clean scan of the back as well. Great looking card. \r\n\r\nSold. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4881/45541514604_3fac50314a.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4901/46214639292_5b0568e561.jpg[/img]",
