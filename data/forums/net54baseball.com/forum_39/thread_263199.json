As you can tell, most of these are in rough shape and/or trimmed but some are pretty tough.\r\n\r\nLooking for EPDGs I need or even upgrades to ones I already have.  But will also entertain offers.  \r\n\r\nShoot me a PM with what you have.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJeff \r\n\r\n\r\nBERGER, GANLEY, GRAHAM, GRAHAM, KRUGER, OBERLIN, TURNER are sold\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4824/46280940401_5c9f1bdd7f_b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4878/46280942081_737d146600_b.jpg[/IMG]",
