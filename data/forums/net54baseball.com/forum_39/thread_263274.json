(this is not proven yet, but evidence is leaning towards this so far.....these cards are just as rare as the broadleaf 460 cards in every way.....not only are they cool, rare, and scarce.....a really great endeavor would be to collect all 34 players known ! that would be a feat, considering there are only approx 1-5 examples of each of the 34 playes known to exist! (Mcintyre which I will be listing is an example where there are only 1 example known to exist! \r\n\r\n\r\nget an example at 1/5 th the price of a broadleaf 460!\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE BROADLEAF 460 BACKS:   34 players:\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.t206resource.com/Broad%20Leaf%20460%20Checklist.html[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CAP 350-460 FACT 30 POSSIBLE BACKS: (EXCEPT FOR 6 SUPERPRINTS):\r\n****Notice O'leary and Mcintyre not possible with this back!!!******\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.t206resource.com/Sweet%20Caporal%20350-460%20No30%20Checklist.html[/url]\r\n\r\nKNOWN EXAMPLES OF YELLOW/BROWNS THAT EXIST(COURTESY OF CHRIS BROWN)::\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) McIntyre Yellow/Brown NO PRINT ONLY EXAMPLE  KNOWN TO EXIST!

MISSING COLORS AND NAME AND TEAM !!FREAK SCRAP!!\r\n\r\n$2,500.00\r\n\r\n  super weird card  SGC GRADED AS\"MISSING INK\" -  This card is sick sick sick!!:eek: I have owned this for many years and acquired it from a very reputable collector back in the day.....card is super \"SPOOKY\"   it is labeled as \"missing red ink\" as they were not sure what to put on the flip!  card also has some weird backwards writing in the caption field....CARD ALSO HAS NO NAME! some call this a protype type of 206.....nonetheless, extremely dramatic and freaky almost \"spooky\"....a truly one-of-a-kind card  true print scrap and SGC graded as such....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Butler Sov 350 PRINTERS SCRAP  \r\n\r\n\r\n$1,800.00\r\n\r\nSGC GRADED AS \"AUTH\" ....this card has a color shift front, hand cut \"wavy\" cut borders, miscut back showing part of the next back, offset rev wet sheet transfer Sov Back!!!WOW!! a lot going on with this card.....an almost never seen LEGIT SOV SCRAP!....but the super cool part about this card is the \"offset/reverse W/S/T sov back...very unique and interesting card\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  RAYMOND MISSING INK/COLOR SHIFT-    PRINTER'S SCRAP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$500.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  STARR missing RED INK- RAW  blue lapel ***NOT PRINTERS SCRAP****  \r\n\r\n$500.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalmost completely missing inks!!!!beautiful \"baby blue\"  very dramatic compared to issued card..wavy borders  pale \"ghost face\" baby blue background shifted over the border..a little rough condition, but price reflects that!;)\r\n\r\nnote:\r\n*****card is not graded******selling as is/ card is raw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplease see pic below of all yellow browns known to exist(  only 2 olearys known and only 1 McIntyre)\r\n\r\nscans of cards will be added",
