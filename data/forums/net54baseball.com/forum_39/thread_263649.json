During the episode I believe I attributed your book to Bill Brown.  Sorry about that.  The book is awesome and I have referred several listeners to it.\n\nI'm not intending to call Lenox Brown an \"illegitimate back.\" Obviously it's a real back.  My intent in carving out that tier was to bring backs together that have such low pops and appear with so few fronts that your average set collector, or even back collector can discount them.  There are just 17 Lenox Browns directly attributed by PSA.  I have seen 1 (maybe 2) change hands this year.  \n\nMy research centers around comparative scarcity.  Cards that are tough with a certain back even if the combination facially looks normal or uninteresting.",

I took the conversation to place it more in the \"Wildest Dreams\" than \"Not really real\" category.  I would certainly be interested however on thoughts about the Old Mill Blue backs found of late.
