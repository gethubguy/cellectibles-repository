      "post_content": "Near complete T206 set for sale.  I think I have like 510-ish out of the 520.  All the big names, all the big cards (of the 520 set).  The 10 or so cards that I need are all easy, readily available HOFers.  All 4 Cobbs, Demmit and O'Hara, all the Mathewson's, all the Cy Young's, all 48/48 Southern Leaguers, and 2 100% guaranteed signed Larry Doyles (from the Great 2007 Pittsburgh Find) are in here.  And most importantly they are all in a binder!  All raw in plastic pages, most were broken out of slabs.  While they all have good eye appeal, the conditions vary.  They range from Authentic to Poor to VG/EX.  I'm always up for a good trade, so a combination of cash and trade works as well.  And although he was my favorite player, 89T Gregg Jefferies will not be welcomed as trade.  Nor will any 89 Donruss, 89 Score, 89 Fleer, or 83T Wade Boggs.  I live in Pittsburgh PA and any serious buyers are more than welcome to come see the set in person.  I'll try to post some scans to give you a general idea of their shape, and will be more than happy to provide pics of me holding the cards (or whatever weird scenario you can think of haha)....",
