I am offering the Mullin now @ $85, same terms as below. Sorry for the mix-up!\r\n\r\nFred\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a BEAUTY! Color, Contrast, Centering far superior than the given grade! $125 delivered. Payment via check, MO or PayPal Gift.\r\n\r\nFor those that are fairly new to Net54 or those that do not know me (been absent a couple of yrs) here's the thread from 2009 that sheds light on the history of my T206's that I am going to liquidate. I think you will find it interesting.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=118774&highlight=t206[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFred",
