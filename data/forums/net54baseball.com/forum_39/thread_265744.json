      "post_content": "Looking for the following T206s: Mathewson Portrait, Young Portrait, Young with Glove, and Johnson Portrait.   Condition wise, looking for PSA/SGC 1-4 or equivalent raw, not really looking for beaters.  Backs are not a big influence, but a slight preference to 150 series or slightly harder backs (polar bear, Old Mill).  Please email with what you have available, scans, and asking price. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDJ\r\n[url]x2drich2000@yahoo.com[/url]",
