I don't have to speculate that it would grade 2 or above, because it already has.  This card has been in my custody for nearly 7 years.  Let me know if you are interested at a reduced price of $OLD which includes shipping.  Net funds to me by any method.  If you send your drone, I can deliver the card via drone.",
