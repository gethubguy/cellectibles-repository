So the card we have now is original and it looks amazing. A PSA 2 Wagner sells for 900k+ now, and this card would be a PSA 2. Also, the reason we have had the card for so long is because we have not been trying to shop it. Again, we had a retail store gottahaveit! and the card was perfect for eye candy, we also went to a lot of shows.

So is it currently in a psa holder or was it removed from the holder?  Because if this card was removed from the case then it is actually a raw card. And if it was done before you purchased it then you may have a fake card with a real label.
