Centered with full borders. No creases on either card. Keeler has some wrinkling on lower left corner that is mostly seen on the reverse. Thanks in advance.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1127&pictureid=24434[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1128&pictureid=24435[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1127&pictureid=24239[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1128&pictureid=24238[/IMG]",
