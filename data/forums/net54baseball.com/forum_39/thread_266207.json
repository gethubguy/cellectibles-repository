Extremely rare back, PSA shows only 4 Sovereign 150's total of all grades. Spotless reverse....Sorry for the dark picture, card is much brighter with an astounding yellow color. For better pics, please email me.... Card otherwise is a 7 or 7.5, fantastic value at $685..... PRICE reduced to $595 **SOLD**",
