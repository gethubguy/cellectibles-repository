      "post_content": "Time to thin out the collection a bit.  I have the following cards available.  Am willing to listen to counter offers but honestly I don\u2019t have patience for lowball offers....all grades are PSA unless noted:   I\u2019ll work on adding asking prices soon. \n\nCy Young Glove shows - Tolstoi 4.5.  Presents like a strong EX+ to ExMt but there is a noticeable small spot of (tobacco?) staining on top border.  $4000 now $3900 now $3800\n\nWarhop batting - Carolina Brights 4 - solid card.  Sold\n\nMcGraw Glove at Hip - Red Hindu 1.5 - noticeable crease - strong clean back - $2000 now $1900 now $1850\n\nMullen \u201cMullin\u201d BroadLeaf 350 - 2 - accurately graded, clean reverse.  Sold\n\nJennings Both Hands - AB 350 NF - 6MC - very strong card almost no border on right hand side ... typical for AB.  $995 now $925\n\nClancy - AB 350 Frame - 6MC - near perfect centering on the front, back is somewhat OC - resubmit candidate - $325\n\nIrv Young - AB 350 Frame - 4.5.  Not sure what PSA didn\u2019t like here presents nicer. 1 of 1 in grade w/ one higher.  Sold\n\nHuggins Hands at Mouth - AB 350 Frame - 3.5. Accurately graded. Clean reverse.  1 of 2 in that grade w/ one higher $450 now $425\n\nBrown Washington - Sov 350 - 4.  $650 now $635\n\nRuss Ford - Sov 460 - 3.  Imo overgraded.  Spot of paper loss on the front.   $70 now $68 now $66\n\nmcGann - Cycle 350 - 4 - sold\nMaddox - Cycle 350 - SGC 40/3 - surface wrinkle but otherwise nice.  $225 now $220\n\nF. Jones hands at side - RAW - Brown Hindu.  Best guess is VG+ Maybe VgEx on a good day. No creases but rounded corners. $595.  Last PSA 4 went for over $1k\n\n\n\n\nEmail: [url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url] if interested",
