      "post_content": "Broadleaf 15-count pack: $1000 net to me. (SOLD) Nearly impossible to find a BL pack in better shape than this. There is a date on the stamp, which I believe is 1916 or 1918. T206 were found in 10-count packs, but good luck finding one of those. Found in a wall in upstate NY during a renovation.\n\nBroadleaf 20-count pack: $200 net to me. (SOLD) This might be the only 20-count BL pack. Condition is really rough. There is no date on the stamp, but I think it is also a late teens stamp. Found tucked under a windowsill in upstate NY.\n\nRecruit 10-count pack: $25 net to me. Date is tough to read, but I think it is from the 1920s (maybe 1926).\n\nBL 15 COUNT:\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=350708&d=1555798218[/IMG]\n\nBL 20 COUNT:\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=350709&d=1555798347[/IMG]\n\nRECRUIT:\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=350710&d=1555798360[/IMG]",
