In truth, this set and these cards brought me back to collecting and it has been really enjoyable. I\u2019ve bought some really cool cards and have had a great experience so far, can\u2019t say enough about this site and the members. That truth/fluff aside, my two projects so far are collecting Cubs and the Elite 11/12 cards. I\u2019ve got some work to do on the latter so would be grateful if anyone has any to offer, will consider all offers!\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nAndy",
