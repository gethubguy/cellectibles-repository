I am looking for a 1-2 grade, and would be open to either cash or cards to make up the difference.\r\n2) The Reagan pictured here is a dupe. I am looking to trade it for something I need. This card is ranked #9 on the scarcity list for the ENTIRE 524 set!\r\n\r\nHere is the list of what I still need:\r\nBay\r\nBernhard\r\nLipe\r\nMcCauley\r\nRockenfeld\r\nSmith, Sid\r\nViolat \r\n\r\nLet's make a deal!",
