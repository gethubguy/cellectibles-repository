      "post_content": "I bought a Conroy/With Bat with a UZIT back, graded PSA 3, at REA back in March.  I've put it up for sale on ebay at a pretty healthy price, but what I'd really like to do is trade it for a few cards I need to complete my all-SGC graded set, which currently stands at 395.  I have $5120 in the card and need, among others, an SGC-graded Cobb/Red Portrait, Lajoie/Portrait, Cy Young/Glove Shows, and Cy Young/Bare Hand Shows in the 2 to 4-grade range.  If you're interested and have anything that gets you close let me know.\r\n\r\nMarty",
