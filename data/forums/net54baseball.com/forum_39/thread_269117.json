While it\u2019s a new acquisition I can assure anyone interested that it\u2019s a completed transaction that\u2019s been paid for and on its way to me.  I have tracking info on the item as well as dozens of hobby references for anyone who may be concerned.",

Let's make them verbal this time. \r\nThe one about when it sold and the one about how it would grade should not be here.....PM me to discuss further OR post this issue in the thread on the front page and see what others think about the comments? Not that it really matters because, imo, they are out of line. But we could see what others think too. Thanks",

If you don't know if your post in someone elses post might cross the line just PM me...better yet, you should have PMd the OP with your question.
