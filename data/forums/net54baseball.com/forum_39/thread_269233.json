There was an additional Wajo Portrait that was also in the auction with the same back (SC150/30) and had oversized borders left to right which was also a handcut card. I think it\u2019s possible they came from the same sheet as they were graded together (sequential SGC numbers).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019m looking to trade this for other T206\u2019s as it doesn\u2019t really fit my collection. And if you have any EPDGs I need, I\u2019m definitely listening\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty open to offers, so shoot me a PM.\r\n\r\nFor pricing, $SOLD\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47105750324_753e3fc96a_b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47895011891_33e63895a7_b.jpg[/IMG]",
