All in pitiful shape but that might make them affordable. I\u2019m interested in the two Magee cards, looking to put $500 towards those two. I don\u2019t want a bunch of folks getting in a bidding war but if you might want to bid on the lot with me, contact me and let me know your max bid. We\u2019ll make a run at getting these. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://auction.lelands.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=93608\" target=\"_blank\">https://auction.lelands.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=93608</a>",
