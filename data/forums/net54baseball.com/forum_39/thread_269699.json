Been working on this for just over 5 years and I just broke through 90% of the subset.....so I\u2019m looking for the following regardless of condition....well would prefer not highest grades but am still listening of course. Quite familiar with what\u2019s on eBay but if you have something there I need and can wiggle on prices, let me know.\n\nI have a few low grade ones available for trade too, Mostly low grade with some trimmed.\n\nLooking for:\nCobb, Ty (Bat Off Shoulder)\nCobb, Ty (Portrait - Red)\nHummel, John\nTinker, Joe (Bat Off Shoulder)\nYoung, Cy (With Glove)",
