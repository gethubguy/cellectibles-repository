This card has that, which means that it is a legit Murr'y error. The problem: there is paper loss exactly over the part of the name where the broken A should be. SGC agrees that this is a Murr'y error, but they won't slab it as such because of the paper loss. There is enough paper there to see that there is no A where there should be one, but the paper loss made SGC skittish. I have included a close up scan of the paper loss and the print dot.\r\n\r\nMurr'y:[STRIKE] $400[/STRIKE] $325 net to me, shipped. (SOLD)",
