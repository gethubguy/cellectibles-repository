      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI recently acquired the attached cards from a local dealer.  I deal in almost all post war cards so not really sure what route to take to move these two.  \n\n1911 Cycle Cigarettes T206 Ty Cobb Bat off Shoulder SGC 1.5 - $20,000 OBO\nOnly 4 sales ever per VCP, most recent being a PSA 1.5 for $18,000 in REA's 2018 Fall Auction - the card was missing a corner.  This one is under graded imo, likely due to the stain on top right\n\n1912 Broad Leaf Cigarettes T207 Irving Lewis No Emblem On Sleeve SGC 1.5 - PENDING SALE \nOnly 3 sales ever per VCP\n-$17,625 for a PSA 6 on 5/2/10\n$12,936 for a PSA 2.5 on 1/31/14\n$8,012 for a SGC Authentic on 11/19/15\n\nAll reasonable offers will be considered.  Please ask any questions you may have.  I plan on having these at my booth at the national in Chicago, and then ultimately sending them to REA if I do not move them by then. \n\nThanks!\nMike",
