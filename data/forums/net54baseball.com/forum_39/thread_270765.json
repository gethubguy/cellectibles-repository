I have scans if you would like to see them.\r\nI have a very limited number of items that I would consider in trade, but primarily looking to sell.\r\nPlease send me a message if you would like more information or to discuss details.  Plenty of hobby references available.  \r\nThanks for looking and I am happy to answer any questions\r\nEric",
