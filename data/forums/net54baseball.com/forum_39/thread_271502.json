Maybe a 3 or 3.5, but a nice one at that. Not a PWCC purchase. Price: $3000. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe 3 is bright and well focused. Appears to be a small surface wrinkle on the back of his head. It's a Sweet Cap 350-460/42 OP, which is a bit rarer than other Sweet Caps if you care about that sort of thing. Not a PWCC purchase. Price: $1300\r\n\r\nPrices are firm at this point. I'll update if I decide to lower, but will probably take to the National for trade bait/consignment if no interest. \r\n\r\nPlease email [url]samuelswartz@yahoo.com[/url] for fastest communication.",
