I\u2019m interested in buying my first T206 cobb and need help on what to look for outside of the basics.  I would prefer to buy the card, not the holder or grade, but for the sake of investment overall demand/interest in the hobby I need help with the following:\r\n\r\n-SGC or PSA (personally I like the looks of these cards in the SGC holders better)\r\n\r\n-Red vs the rarer green back?\r\n\r\n-What red backs would you recommend?\r\n\r\nShould I consider any card with a clean white back to good to be true or chemically cleaned?  \r\n\r\nHow do you best tell centering on these top to bottom?  From the nameplate on the bottom or boarder?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
