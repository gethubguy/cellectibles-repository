Ask around, I'm a pretty reasonable trade partner.\n\nIf trading, I only collect HOFers, mostly T206, a few T205 and some various E cards.  The occasional 1950s as well.\n\nPM or email to [url]david@davidratliff.com[/url]. \"I'll take it\" trumps everything just for clarity. Prices are DLVD via PP F&F to keep it simple.\n\n\nT206 Bender Portrait Sweet Cap 150/30 PSA 4 - $435 OBO\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/do4OwJ3l.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/FOEY2WAl.jpg[/img]\n\nT206 Bender with Trees Piedmont 350/25 SGC 40 - $165 OBO\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/xt98x3El.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/ktlwdHZl.jpg[/img]\n\nT206 Wallace Portrait Piedmont 150/25 SGC 50 - $250 OBO\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/x0IZ8YZl.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/BfLpQCMl.jpg[/img]\n\nT206 Durham Portrait Piedmont 150/25 PSA 3.5 - $225 OBO\nTBD\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/HVvndgxl.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/17G3ikol.jpg[/img]",
