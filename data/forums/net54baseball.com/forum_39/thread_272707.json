But it also shows a Polar Bear \"transfer.\"  Being Tolstoi and PB were produced at different factories, this \"transfer\" must have happened post-production (I assume :rolleyes:).  The reversed PB back is just a random example, not included in sale.\n\nThanks, Scott",

The \"hurricane\" stopped all mail service on Tuesday.  I would imagine mail service will not be back until Friday.  So expect some delays.  You can't fight Mother Nature :p\r\n\r\nIt's only skirting us.  As of now just drizzle and breezy.  So no real concern, just a pain and inconvenience.  It is certainly a good reason for people not to go to work ..... \r\n\r\nBTW only 100 or so commons remain.  Same pricing available as stated above ^^^\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott",
