      "post_content": "Once again, my monthly plea for a few Sovereign 150 cards I\u2019m trying to hunt down.  I\u2019m particularly looking for these three tough ones:\n\nAmes (Hands at Chest)\nG. Brown (Chicago)\nM. Brown (Cubs on shirt)\nBurch (Batting)\nEvers (Bat, Cubs on shirt)\nPattee\n\nIf, by chance, you\u2019re looking to offload one of these gems, let me know!  I\u2019ll also trade for other Sovereigns, but most of my dupes are beaters.  Lots of T205 dupes as well.\n\nCheers,\nGeno",
