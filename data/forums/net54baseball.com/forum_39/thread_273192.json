Thanks for looking and good luck with your collection. See scans for further details.\r\n\r\n1. T206 - Molly Miller (So. League card) - PSA 3, Piedmont 350 back, Factory 25, $120.00\r\n\r\n2. T206 - Joe Kelley (HOF- double name on top and bottom) - PSA 5 (MC), Piedmont 350 back, Factory 25, $305.00. \r\nI believe the MC qualifier is due to the extra large top border, with a partial name on the top edge.
