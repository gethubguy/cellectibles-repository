      "post_content": "Available are a large group of PSA graded cards available for purchase.  A little bit of everything is here and are available only because they don't fit into my set.  They came from a large AH purchase about 30 days ago (not PWCC).  \r\n\r\nHOF players, tougher backs, lots of commons and lots of quality cards in varying grades (PSA A-PSA 5.5)  \r\n\r\nPrices on the list I'll provide are via a no fee method and include shipping.  Happy to accept offers on groups, too!  \r\n\r\nPM me your email address for a list of what's available! I'll work on this for a few hours tonight and then after I leave the office tomorrow evening.  I'd appreciate if you would PM versus posting that you'd like a list as it's just easier to manage what will likely be a number of requests.  They will be addressed in order, too.\r\n\r\nThanks and I look forward to working with any and all of you on this!",
