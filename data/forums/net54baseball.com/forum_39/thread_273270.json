It's mainly used for autobody and aerospace and very expensive. I personally looked into it, because it fits my line of work, dealing with restorations and rust removal. Usually sandblasting heavy steel with aluminum oxide is usually the starting process. But your also removing a layer of good metal when sand blasting. With this new process, just the rust is eliminated. There are many settings, depending on what your trying to do and the material your working with. One setting literally wipes a piece of paper clean. These machines start at 50K and go up to a million easily, and are used in the restore and repair of bridges and military equipment such as subs and air craft carriers. I'm sure it will be a while before something like this effects the hobby but it's only a matter of time. If I get a chance to use one, I'll bring a card with me and see if I can wipe half of it clean and then examine it under a USB microscope so we all know what to look out for.",
