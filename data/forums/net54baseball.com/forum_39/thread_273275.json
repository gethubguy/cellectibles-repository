I can see all the backs just by bending the page. I can also guarantee these will safely soak as another board member won the other three pages in the auction these were in and he has already successfully removed all of his.\r\n\r\nThe back contains 12 t59 Flags of all nations. These are glued more thoroughly, though I imagine with the same glue, oddly they appear to have had back damage before they were glued into the album so these will be low grade even when successfully removed.\r\n\r\nAsking $300 now $240 shipped Priority insured at no extra cost.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://d28lcup14p4e72.cloudfront.net/220100/4774701/Scan_20190906.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://d28lcup14p4e72.cloudfront.net/220100/4774702/Scan_20190906%20(2).jpg[/IMG]",

The last letter of the town is G, and the State is PA so it must've occurred after the switch to two letter abbreviations (1963) which is weird. I've had a lot of offers for that card if I was going to soak it. I have in the past (and disclosed it as my Parsippany customers can attest to) but I just don't want to anymore. I still don't think it's wrong (especially with disclosure) but I can't see myself doing it anymore. I bought this sheet before the scandal and never got around to it.",
