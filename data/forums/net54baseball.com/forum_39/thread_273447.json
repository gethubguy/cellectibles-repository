      "post_content": "Over the next few weeks, I will be selling a group of T206s individually a few at a time until they are gone.  These cards were hidden away for many years, glued to old black photograph book pages that many of us are familiar with.  I am soaking them in distilled water ONLY to remove them from the pages, rubbing them gently in distilled water with my finger to remove glue remnants, and drying them on unbleached paper towels. That is it.  Almost every one of them has come off easily and cleanly.  If you have any questions about this process, please let me know!\r\n\r\nAll of them will be sold raw.  If you are not happy with a card for any reason, please return it for a full refund.  \r\n\r\nI plan to price them reasonably and reduce the price if they do not sell quickly.  All will be posted in this same thread, so please check back often if you are interested.  I will post new cards as I get time.\r\n\r\nI will do my best to provide good photos, but I can email larger scans if desired.  I will also note creases or other hard to see issues beside each card listed.\r\n\r\nAll prices are net to me, with PayPal preferred.  I will cover the shipping on all orders totaling over $100.  For orders less than that, please add $4.  \r\n\r\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask questions.  \r\n\r\nMight as well start with the best...Ty Cobb!\r\n\r\n1) Ty Cobb - Bat on Shoulder - Piedmont 150/25\r\nRounded corners, small creases in lower left and upper right corners\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n2) Nap Lajoie - Throwing - Piedmont 150/25\r\nRounded corners, several light creases\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n3) Tubby Spencer - Piedmont 150/25\r\nSmall paper loss behind his head\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n4) Ed Willett - Piedmont 350/25\r\nSurface abrasions, small paper loss on back\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n5) Jake Weimer - Piedmont 150/25\r\nSeveral creases, small paper loss on back\r\nSOLD",
