The Jennings is a pop 3, highest graded since they started back designations. Jennings + cash or Jennings/Cobb/cash are also options. Cobb's definitively not for sale. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48785142787_0a79a1ca74_z_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48785142637_2086f05000_z_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48789153867_e85d64edfd_o_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40899158723_a6e39b46f8_z_d.jpg[/IMG]",
