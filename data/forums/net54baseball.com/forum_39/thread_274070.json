Accepting Paypal only.\r\n\r\nThe discounts below will be based upon the overall amount of cards purchased from my numerous listings, not just within this listing.\r\n\r\nLooking to sell the cards in my various listings I am posting, so I am offering the following discounts for larger purchases: Buy 3 or more cards, free shipping, 6 or more cards, 10% off, buy 12 or more, 15% off. Commitment to buy snags these cards, and I will ship promptly and securely in a padded envelope.
