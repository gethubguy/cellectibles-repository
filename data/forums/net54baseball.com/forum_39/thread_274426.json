      "post_content": "I recently upgraded this card in my collection and need to make room for more cards. Very nicely centered example, card does have a crease that runs across the top of the card, right through Jimmy's eyes, easier to see in the scan of the back of the card.  In an SGC 30 holder.  Asking $ 50.00 delivered, OBO.  Payment Paypal F/F.  I would also consider trading for other CUBS Sweet Caporal backs that I need for my collection.",
