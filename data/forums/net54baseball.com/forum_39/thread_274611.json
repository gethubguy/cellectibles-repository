      "post_content": "So I have been toying with this for awhile and thought i would put it out there and see what happens. I have been collecting T206 John McGraw backs, all 4 poses for the last several years. I currently have 42 of the 45 possible backs (PWC AB, PWC Uzit, Glove at hip Uzit being the three I don't have and 2 of those are 1/1) I also have Type II and III Coupon cards for Glove at hip and Portrait with cap Poses and and orange variation of Portrait no cap. I want to try to sell as a group at first. I may break them up, but would like to have them stay together as a run if I can find a new home for them. Here is a link to my Flickr page that shows them \r\n\r\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/157008903@N05/albums/72157707790911594[/url]\r\n\r\n. The four that aren't graded in the scans have been graded by PSA as follows-\r\n\r\nFinger in Air old mill PSA 1\r\n\r\nPortrait with cap PD 350/460/25- PSA 2\r\n\r\nPortrait no cap PD 150 PSA 3\r\n\r\nPortrait no cap old mill PSA 2\r\n\r\nAll cards in folder would be included. \r\n\r\nAsking- $18500 shipped\r\n\r\nPlease message with any questions.
