      "post_content": "For sale is a raw Cobb Bat-off and an SGC 20 Cy Young portrait with a Sovereign back. The Cobb card presents really nicely, and is 100% guaranteed real, but the signature is NOT REAL. It is a chance to own a Cobb within a budget, which is a rarity in the current market. The Young is significantly less than I paid for in REA recently, but I have dupes so looking to get rid of this one. It has a small pinhole on the top center of the card. Price is $SOLD for the Cobb and $sold for the Young, shipped via paypal.
