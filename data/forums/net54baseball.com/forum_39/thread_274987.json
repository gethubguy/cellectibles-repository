I just picked up a 350 factory 30 not pictured, but now these 4 are getting lonely without their missing factory 42OP brother!\r\n\r\nThough I would like to find in similar condition, it is not completely necessary, would like to find something in Good or better condition though.\r\n\r\nPM or email me with anything that you may have for sale [url]Asmusstephen@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve",
