      "post_content": "I have both Cobb Portraits listed for sale on eBay.  The Red was labelled as trimmed by PSA.  The Green was labelled as altered (though I requested trimmed as I think the top left looks funny).  Both have great resolution, vibrant colors, and great centering.  I am open to offers on these cards from NET54 Members.  $2000+ for the Red and $4500+ for the Green.  I am also willing to trade.  Right Now I am into T3s and T204s....\r\n\r\nCobb Red Portrait PSA A:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/153692045703[/url]\r\n\r\nCobb Green Portrait PSA A:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/163919557126[/url]",
