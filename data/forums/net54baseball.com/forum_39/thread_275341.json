      "post_content": "Hello I have this very nice Bender No Trees Piedmont Factory 42 in a PSA 4 .  I am looking to trade it for another rare or semi rare back PSA HOF. I am interested in cards with backs other than Piedmont and Sweet Caporal .The Bender's value I believe is around 1,200.00 but I may be a bit high or low. At this point it is for trade not for sale. Below are the cards I would be interested in trading for in a PSA 4 or above .  I want the value to be equal or will except cash or pay depending on the card I am trading for\r\nBrown Portrait\r\nBrown Cubs Shirt\r\nClarke Portrait\r\nJennings Portrait\r\nJoss Portrait\r\nMathewson Portrait/ and White Cap\r\nMarquard Portrait\r\nMcGraw Portrait No Cap\r\nSpeaker\r\nWaddell Portrait\r\nYoung Bare Hand\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and let me know what you have",
