      "post_content": "Have this lower grade Sam Crawford with the Sweet Cap back that's looking for a good home.  Not much of a pre-war guy so it needs to go somewhere it's going to be appreciated a little more.  You can see from the pics that it's paid it's dues but still centered decently and nice color.  Measures out top to bottom and maybe just a touch wide from sided to side so don't think we have to worry about any trimming here, lol.  Asking SOLD -dlvd via Paypal f&f.  \r\nThanks for looking!",
