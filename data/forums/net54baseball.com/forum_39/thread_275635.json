All of them are Piedmont backs, except for about 40-50 Old Mill backs.  I have a great many dupes.  I have around 70 HOF cards, including a Cobb green portrait, a few Young portraits and throwing with glove, 3 Johnson (hands at chest) and 1 Johnson portrait, lots of Keeler and E. Collins, and a bunch of other great HOF cards.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I love my T206 cards.  That said, I am thinking of selling a large portion of my cards (I want to keep a couple dozen HOF cards).\r\n\r\nSo which of the auction house(s) would you recommend for a large raw lot like mine, and why?  My main goal is to maximize my return.  Thanks in advance!",

And depending on how much time you want to devote to it, individual pricing on HOF and tougher cards would help you maximize return. \r\n\r\nAlso consider getting some of the HOF graded unless they are really low grade.",
