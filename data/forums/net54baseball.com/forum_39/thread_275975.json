I\u2019d prefer a big lot to go through which provides extras so I can have options on different back runs when I complete the 520 goal. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m also working on my HOF set so raw low/mid potential grades I\u2019d be open to. \r\n\r\nSend me a message or email with your sale list/pics\r\n\r\n[url]Derekalonzi@gmail.com[/url]",
