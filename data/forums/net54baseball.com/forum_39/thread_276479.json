      "post_content": "Over the next few weeks, I will once again be selling a large group of T206s individually a few at a time until they are gone. These cards were pasted to period backings for the last 100+ years. No fears of trimming here.  I am soaking them in distilled water ONLY to remove them from the backing, rubbing them gently in distilled water with my finger to remove glue remnants, and drying them on unbleached paper towels. That is it. If you have any questions about this process, please let me know!\r\n\r\nAll of them will be sold raw. If you are not happy with a card for any reason, please return it for a full refund.  (The last time I did a T206 project just like this a few months ago, I had zero returns on approximately 100 cards)\r\n\r\nI plan to price them reasonably and reduce the price if they do not sell quickly. All will be posted in this same thread, so please check back often if you are interested. I will post new cards as I get time.\r\n\r\nI will do my best to provide good scans that show the condition of the front and back. I will also note hard to see issues beside each card listed.\r\n\r\nAll prices are net to me, with PayPal preferred. I will cover the shipping on all orders totaling over $100. For orders less than that, please add $4.\r\n\r\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask questions.\r\n\r\nOnce again I will start with the best...Ty Cobb!\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\nTy Cobb Green Portrait - Notice the color has faded some over the years, as it was found in a frame and likely displayed.  A few small areas of paper loss on the back. - SOLD\r\n\r\nGeorge Gibson - SOLD\r\n\r\nPerry Lipe (Southern Leaguer) - SOLD\r\n\r\nJoe Lake - SOLD\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCy Young Portrait - SOLD\r\n\r\nLarry Doyle - SOLD\r\n\r\nSimon Nicholls - SOLD\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm - SOLD\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\nHal Chase Pink Portrait - SOLD\r\n\r\nJimmy Jackson - SOLD\r\n\r\nRed Kleinow - SOLD\r\n\r\nBill Hallman - SOLD",
