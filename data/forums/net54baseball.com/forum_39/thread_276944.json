Haven't posted too much here, but done a few dozen deals over the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nStill need to upgrade about 3 dozen cards to complete the set in PSA 6+   Want to buy decent centering, any backs, PSA graded 6,6.5,7 or 7.5**  \r\n** May consider PSA 8\r\n** May consider PSA 4.5, 5, 5.5 for Plank, Demmitt STL, Magie and Ohara STL\r\n\r\nI'll buy them outright and pay well or am happy to trade, if of interest (have plenty of good tradebait). I'll also pay a finder's fee if you can get me plugged into some of these i'm missing.\r\n\r\nHere's the list - thanks so much!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJoey\r\n\r\nAmes, Red Hands at Chest\r\nBreitenstein, Ted Follow Through\r\nBrown, George Batting Chicago\r\nBurch, Al Battting\r\nCarey, Scoops Fielding\r\nCobb, Ty Red Portrait\r\nColes, Cad Portrait\r\nDahlen, Bill BOSTON Portrait\r\nDessau, Rube\r\nDemmitt, Ray Standing STL\r\nDevlin, Art  Portrait\r\nEllam, Roy Batting\r\nFritz, Charlie Ready to Throw\r\nGoode, Wilbur Batting\r\nHart, Jimmy  Fielding\r\nJackson, Jimmy Portrait\r\nKonetchny, Ed Glove High\r\nLipe, Perry Portrait\r\nMagie, Sherwood Portrait\r\nMullaney, Dom Fielding\r\nMullin, George Batting\r\nOHara, Bill STL Batting\r\nPhelps, Eddie Fielding\r\nPlank, Eddie Portrait\r\nPoland, Phil Portrait\r\nReulbach, Ed Glove Showing\r\nRevelle, Dutch Portrait\r\nRockenfeld, Ike Fielding?\r\nSeitz, Charles Portrait\r\nShaw, Hunky Portrait\r\nSmith, Carlos Portrait\r\nSteinfeldt, Harry Batting\r\nYoung, Cy Bare Hand",
