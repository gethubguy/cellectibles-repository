Could be a high value card in similar condition or even a common in much better (slabbed please) condition... or something in between.\r\n\r\nNote that one of these had been graded authentic but was pulled out of the slab by an earlier owner.\r\n\r\nA T206 or a T202 would be preferred.  My wantlists can be found at this website:  \r\n\r\n[url]http://klsdad.com/[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n(Hmmmm...having trouble with pics.  Gonna post and try to add them)",
