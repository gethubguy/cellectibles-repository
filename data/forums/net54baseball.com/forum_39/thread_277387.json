I am on the PSA Set Registry.\r\n\r\nI have decided to branch out some and collect a Polar Bear back subset (primarily action pictures to start since I have been focused portraits). \r\n\r\nJust purchased an initial small group from a Net54 member.  Starting to look for other groups or singles.\r\n\r\nI am planning to do this back subset primarily ungraded....low to mid grade is fine considering my budget.",
