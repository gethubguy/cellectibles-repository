      "post_content": "SGC 1 Walter Johnson hands at chest.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think he is undergraded by half a grade.  Regardless, this is a really good 1.  This was graded after a scrapbook removal and I got it as part of a lot. You can see it still has a lot of scrapbook residue on the back and a very small loss on his collar. Otherwise the front is really nice.\r\n\r\nWill consider trades for him but asking $SOLD shipped. Shoot me a PM.\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iatUt1][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49334050582_5e077892be_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iatUsj][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49334050542_b310efdfa8_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
