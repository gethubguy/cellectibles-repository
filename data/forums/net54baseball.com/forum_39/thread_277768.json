      "post_content": "Nice looking and well centered Walter Johnson portrait.  2.5 grade is the result of corner rounding/wear and a faint crease/wrinkle in the upper right corner.  My scanner does not handle slabbed cards very well (the large image below), but I am happy to email larger iPhone photos if you would like to have a closer look.\r\n\r\nSOLD total, net to me (no taxes and I pay for shipping).  PayPal (Friend) preferred.\r\n\r\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with questions.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
