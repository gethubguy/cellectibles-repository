I don\u2019t know how to price him to be honest, so if you are interested in buying him, let me know if the price is off.\r\n\r\nLooking to trade this Quinn Broad Leaf 350 I got as part of a scrapbook lot last month.  It doesn\u2019t fit my collection at all.\r\n\r\nCard is listed as possible but unconfirmed on T206Resource but was confirmed a few years back through one of Ted\u2019s threads here on N54. Regardless, there have not been any graded as both PSA and SGC list his pop as 0. I can\u2019t find any sales of this front/back combo either.\r\n\r\nSo I really have no idea how to price it and instead am offering it up for trade. Looking for T206 EPDG HOFers or generally uncommon back cards. But I\u2019d also consider swaps for the Big 4. I can do trade and cash either direction too.  Would love to hear your thoughts on the card or what you may have available for trade. Please PM me and we can talk.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!  Hope we can make a deal.....\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2icGt9m][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49359134848_11effa0778_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2icKTE8][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49359802647_69d4960c46_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
