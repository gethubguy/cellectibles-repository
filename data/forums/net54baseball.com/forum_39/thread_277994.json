      "post_content": "I have this super nice looking Joe Lake no ball AB460.  Condition is sharp SGC 40.  \r\n\r\nI'm looking to trade this for another AB460 (or 2) that I don't have.  Not interested in any of the 12 easier ones.  Flexible on condition.  Happy to take back a little cash or add cash as necessary.  \r\n\r\nPM or email me at [url]vettejayk@aol.com[/url] to discuss.",
