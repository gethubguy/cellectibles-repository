      "post_content": "Now that the Heritage Auction of David Hall's T206's has concluded, I am offering the only other known example of this Cycle 350 card that was sold. \n\n[url]https://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball/1909-11-t206-cycle-350-jap-barbeau-psa-ex-5-pop-one-none-higher-for-brand/a/50021-54019.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515[/url]\n\nThe high bidder was able to purchase the other top copy including buyer's premium for $973.20. This of course, does not include any relevant sales tax nor shipping and handling costs.\n\nOne of the benefits of being a Net 54 member or perhaps the fortunate under bidder is to accept my offer for the Barbeau card at a delivered price of $800 via paypal F&F\n\nThanks\nWayne",
