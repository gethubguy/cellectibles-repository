      "post_content": "Greetings to all,\r\n\r\nI am slowly selling off my T206 collection to help pay for my daughter's college in the fall. \r\n\r\nI am going to dip my toes in the water and start with a 1910 Ira Thomas card with a Sweet Caporal 350 Back.  \r\n\r\nSGC 20 (Fair 1.5)\r\n\r\n$30.00 delivered\r\n\r\nWhen I started selling on eBay on January 1st, I had 518 of \"The Monster's 524\".  Most of my cards are in the SGC 10, 20, & 30 range.  My Cobbs, johnson, Mathewson cards are gone, but if there are any low-grade cards you are interested in, please drop me a line.  \r\n\r\nI sell on eBay under the same name, but after a $17.000 January, they put me on a limit of 50 listeings and $2,500 a month until I have been a member for 90 days.  :mad:",
