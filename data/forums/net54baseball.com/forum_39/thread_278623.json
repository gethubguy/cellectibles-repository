      "post_content": "Addendum #7 - Rules are meant to be broken, so there are very few.  Ask about any card you want, not just the original twenty on the list.  A couple of back scans are paired with the wrong front (perhaps more), Ames Hands over and Kelley so far.  I plan to respond promptly at this point.  The initial rush was a bit trying in this regard. \r\n\r\n I will be traveling from Feb 16th until Feb 26th.  I will attempt to keep up with inquiries during this 11 day span, but no cards will be shipped during my travels.  Thanks for your understanding.  \r\n\r\nI expect that all parcels mailed should be received by Friday, tomorrow.  Let me know if you haven\u2019t received yours yet.\r\n\r\nAddendum #6 - What we need is some images, so have a Ball for $160\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10028/ball-cle[/IMG]\r\n\r\nor cross Criss off your list for $75\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/37492/criss[/IMG]\r\n\r\nor place your bet and pick a Chick for $360\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10249/gandil[/IMG]\r\n\r\nor any of the other 447 available\r\n\r\nAddendum #5 - No sales during Super Bowl.  I wonder why.  20 parcels have been shipped on or before Saturday.  If you have any concern about the location of your parcel, I have a complete list of shipping dates and tracking numbers.  I have freed up some space in my inbox, so responding by email, PM or in the thread is fine.\r\nI am still waiting for one check in the mail for a shipped item, but I will contact that buyer privately if it doesn't come today.  66 cards have been sold or pending so far   Thanks to everyone for their interest, purchases, patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nAddendum #4 - I am shifting the bulk of communication, negotiation, notification and complaints to email either through Net54 email link or directly to [url]fburkett54@gmail.com[/url].  Once I get over 400 PMs, they can be downloaded or deleted if no longer relevant, but finding what I need to find becomes harder.\r\nCarry on.  Today is the last shipping day this week.:D\r\n\r\nAddendum #3 - 14 parcels have been shipped.  The following cards have been sold.\r\n\r\nWid Conroy (Fielding)\r\nMike Donlin (Fielding)\r\nBill Hinchman\r\nHarry Pattee\r\nJoe Tinker Bat Off\r\nSam Crawford Throwing\r\nEddie Collins\r\nJimmy Kling\r\nWildfire Schulte (Rear View)\r\nHowie Camnitz\r\n\r\nPeter Cassidy\r\nBill Maloney\r\nGeorge Browne\r\nBill O'Hara NY\r\nGeorge Browne\r\nJimmy Slagle\r\nRoy Brashear\r\nGermany Schaefer\r\nFrank Baker\r\nSherry Magee Portrait\r\n\r\nMerle Adkins\r\nFrank Oberlin\r\nBill Dahlen (BOS)\r\nBill Dahlen (BRO)\r\nHal Chase (Trophy)\r\nJap Barbeau\r\nHarry Lord\r\nJack Knight\r\nMoose McCormick\r\nJake Pfeister Seated\r\n\r\nSpike Shannon\r\nChief Bender (Portrait)\r\nJoe Doyle\r\nShag\r\nJohnny Bates\r\nLou Criger\r\nMike Donlin Seated\r\nMickey Doolin Batting\r\nClyde Engle\r\nCecil Ferguson\r\n\r\nBill Graham\r\nBuck Herzog NY\r\nHarry Hinchman\r\nOtto Knabe\r\nPryor McElveen\r\nLarry McLean\r\nBarney Pelty Vert\r\nFrank Smith White Cap\r\nVic Willis Tolstoi\r\nBob Hall\r\n\r\nMathewson White Cap\r\nEd Hahn\r\nBill Hallman\r\nKaiser Wilhelm - Hands at Chest\r\nOllie Pickering\r\nMordecai Brown (Cubs Shirt)\r\nJohn McGraw (Cap)\r\nEd Ames (Hands Over Head)\r\nMike Donlin (Bat)\r\nRube Marquard (Follow Through)\r\n\r\n\r\nand 14 other pending sales\r\n\r\nAddendum #2 - Shipping has started.  I am keeping tracking numbers and will know when you receive your cards.  You needn't send a note to that effect to let me keep some room in my inbox.  Of course if there is a problem let me know, but let's do the \"problem\" correspondence via email thru Net54.  FYI we are approaching 250 PMs in less than 3 days.  Thanks to all for your patience. \r\n\r\nAddendum #1 - Due to sequential purchases by the same buyers I am slowing down the packing and shipping process to combine orders before shipping.  As many of you know, this is not my standard MO.  I appreciate your patience and your purchases.  I have tried to keep up with all the PMs (over 100 in 1 1/2 days), but if you do not hear from me within 24 hours, drop me an email or PM reminder through the net54 system.  \r\n\r\nI am more sympathetic with auction house errors due to volume than in the past.  I am trying to give the first inquiry the priority on any given card, but I'm not sure that a mistake will not occur.  Until this endeavor I thought I was perfect.:D\r\n\r\nIf you buy a card that has already been sold, a full refund is in order.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be selling or consigning the vast majority of my Monster\r\nAll the cards have scans posted on Collectorfocus.com.\r\nMy collection is titled TOBACCO ROAD.\r\nRoughly half the cards are graded by SGC and can be seen at\r\n[url]https://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/frankbmd/t206-sgc[/url]\r\nThe other T206 categories are defined by TPG, if you return to the category list in the link above.\r\nThe following twenty cards are listed here as Lot A.\r\nAll the Lot A cards are available each for $105.00 shipped by PayPal F&F or other forms of no fee payment.\r\nShipping for multiple cards (valued at $100 each) will be reduced based on actual cost of shipping for larger lots.\r\nIf this method is successful Lots B-Z will follow once only five cards remain available in the current lot.\r\nFell free to browse the entire set of scans and if something catches you eye, feel free to inquire.  I haven't decided what to keep, but do have a target price for sales in the next few months, well below the value of the entire set.\r\nI request all correspondence via PM, but of course buyers are welcome to bump the thread, which I will follow.  \r\nThe average grade of the whole set is 4.1.

I am keeping tracking numbers and will know when you receive your cards.  You needn't send a note to that effect to let me keep some room in my inbox.  Of course if there is a problem let me know, but let's do the \"problem\" correspondence via email thru Net54.  FYI we are approaching 250 PMs in less than 3 days.  Thanks to all for your patience. \r\n\r\nAddendum #1 - Due to sequential purchases by the same buyers I am slowing down the packing and shipping process to combine orders before shipping.  As many of you know, this is not my standard MO.  I appreciate your patience and your purchases.  I have tried to keep up with all the PMs (over 100 in 1 1/2 days), but if you do not hear from me within 24 hours, drop me an email or PM reminder through the net54 system.  \r\n\r\nI am more sympathetic with auction house errors due to volume than in the past.  I am trying to give the first inquiry the priority on any given card, but I'm not sure that a mistake will not occur.  Until this endeavor I thought I was perfect.:D\r\n\r\nIf you buy a card that has already been sold, a full refund is in order.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be selling or consigning the vast majority of my Monster\r\nAll the cards have scans posted on Collectorfocus.com.\r\nMy collection is titled TOBACCO ROAD.\r\nRoughly half the cards are graded by SGC and can be seen at\r\n[url]https://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/frankbmd/t206-sgc[/url]\r\nThe other T206 categories are defined by TPG, if you return to the category list in the link above.\r\nThe following twenty cards are listed here as Lot A.\r\nAll the Lot A cards are available each for $105.00 shipped by PayPal F&F or other forms of no fee payment.\r\nShipping for multiple cards (valued at $100 each) will be reduced based on actual cost of shipping for larger lots.\r\nIf this method is successful Lots B-Z will follow once only five cards remain available in the current lot.\r\nFell free to browse the entire set of scans and if something catches you eye, feel free to inquire.  I haven't decided what to keep, but do have a target price for sales in the next few months, well below the value of the entire set.\r\nI request all correspondence via PM, but of course buyers are welcome to bump the thread, which I will follow.  \r\nThe average grade of the whole set is 4.1.  Only two cards are not graded.\r\n \r\n\r\nAbstein                 P350GAI6\r\nBarger                 P350SGC5\r\nBridwellCap                 P460SGC5\r\nClarkeColumbus         P350SGC5\r\nConroyBat                 SC350SGC5\r\nCrandallCap                 SC460SGC5\r\nDowneyFielding         P350SGC5\r\nGibson                 P150SGC4.5\r\nHallman                 SC350VASGC5\r\nHerzogBoston         P460SGC4.5\r\nI HoffmanProv                 P350SGC5\r\nHowellPortrait         P350SGC5\r\nMcGinley                 SC350SGC5\r\nSchlafly                 P350SGC5\r\nStephens                 P350SGC5\r\nTannehillNo \u201cL\"         P460SGC5\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a peek.\r\n\r\nI have received 16 inquiries so far via PM as requested.  Some cards have multiple requests.  I will respond to each PM in the order received.  This may take a while.  Be patient.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNice",

So the plan going forward is to start a new thread by the end of the month, 2/27, 2/28 or 2/29.\r\n\r\nA selection of cards (5-10) will be offered each week with scans and individually pricing.  There will also be a special price for all the cards that will be available for one week only.\r\n\r\nIndividual sales will still be welcome with subsequent revisions in the whole lot price until the end of the week.  Of course inquiries about cards not part of the weekly packages will be answered.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you as we \"leap\" into the next phase of the sale.",
