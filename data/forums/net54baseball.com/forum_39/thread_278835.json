      "post_content": "Hey guys - hope everyone is doing well.\r\n\r\nThere are four PSA 6-7  T206 cards from the last HA auction that I purchased.   Fedex says were delivered, but the cameras at the home show no one, and the signature that shows up on their system is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAnyways, will deal with the formal investigation and such, but also wanted to put a notice out here for the community, as i had been looking for these upgrades for my set for some time.\r\n\r\nIf you see any of these cards, would very much appreciate a heads up\r\n\r\nT206 PSA 6 Sovereign George Bell PSA #016 338 092\r\nT206 PSA 7 Sweet Cap Steve Evans PSA #905 450 60 \r\nT206 PSA 6 Sovereign Jimmy Jackson PSA #153 204 16\r\nT206 PSA 6 Sovereign Eddie Phelps PSA #231 939 25\r\nHere are the images as well\r\n\r\nThanks to all!  Best regards, Joey",

      "post_content": "Appreciate the comments.   Kevin is right about how long insurance can take (I\u2019m in that business), but I really hope the cards themselves are found.   A couple of those have evaded me for 2 years findings them in grade *sigh*.  If they were \u201cfive finger discounted\u201d, I\u2019m guessing their new owner could care less about their significance \u2014 which makes that thought even worse!!",
