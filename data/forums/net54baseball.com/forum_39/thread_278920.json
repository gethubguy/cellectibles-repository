      "post_content": "I have a small batch of T206 HOFers to sell in a couple of postings. All of them are raw. If you are not happy with a card for any reason, please return it for a full refund. (I've sold two large T206 collections, over 250 cards, and have had zero returned)\r\n\r\nI plan to price them reasonably and reduce the price if they do not sell quickly. All will be posted in this same thread, so please check back to look for new listings if you are interested. \r\n\r\nAll prices are net to me, with PayPal preferred. I will cover the shipping on all orders.\r\n\r\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask questions.\r\n\r\nOnce again I will start with the best...Ty Cobb!\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCobb red portrait - SOLD  Some kid probably folded it over years ago, leaving the crease right through the middle that you see.\r\n\r\nBresnahan portrait - SOLD\r\n\r\nWallace portrait - SOLD Great looking front, but some paper loss on the back.",
