      "post_content": "Ok, I was doing the happy dance thinking I had all 520 cards of the T206set (excluding the Big Four of course). Since it has been 30 years since I got my first T206 card, I had to count them again, log them again, yada yada yada - I'm a few short. Anyway, I am currently looking for the below VARIATION cards in either raw condition, or, from a graded 1-3 (or 10-30). Please send pics of front and back, along with your one-shot best price. I can pay via PP (FF option) or similar.\n\n\u2666 Dahlen (Brooklyn)\n\u2666 Elberfield (Portrait; Washington)\n\u2666 Lundgren (Chicago)\n\nAs soon as I am ready to give up the kids' college fund <grin> I will look for the other 2 that I needs (Demmitt and O'Hara; both St. Louis).\n\nThanks!!\n\nMichael (mflynn@elitevaletservices.com)",
