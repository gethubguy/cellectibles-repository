      "post_content": "Looking to trade for a graded T206 Red Cobb, Green Cobb, Matty White Cap, or WaJo Hands at Chest. I trend toward low grade that present well (no creases, sharp-ish corners, light paper loss, authentic OK) but will also consider higher grades if the deal makes sense. I have the cards below available for trade and am looking to work one, multiple, cash into a deal.",
