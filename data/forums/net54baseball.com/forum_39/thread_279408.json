      "post_content": "This was a rescued card after it had been pasted to a paper backing and displayed in a frame for many, many years.  It has now been graded and slabbed as \"Authentic\" by SGC.  It was soaked off of the paper backing, shows fading and wear, but I see no signs of trimming leading to the \"A\" grade.\r\n\r\nImages below include both pre-slabbed that best show the card, as well as blurry images in the slab (sorry, my scanner does not like slabs).\r\n\r\nSOLD net to me, with no taxes or shipping costs.  Payment by PayPal Friend preferred. \r\n\r\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with questions.  Thanks!",
