      "post_content": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nTwo solid T206 cards here.\r\n\r\n#1   CAMNITZ (ARMS FOLDED) - Sweet Caporal 150, Factory 30.  Card is solid, no crease or wrinkles, remnants of a possible stamp on back that is difficult to determine.  Tiny spot of paperless on back. Perfectly centered.  \r\n\r\n#2. GRIMSHAW (PORTRAIT) - Piedmont 350, Factory 25.  Card was previously slabbed as SGC 35 (2.5).  Another solid card, small wrinkle in lower right but card retains firmness.  Bright colors and perfect centering.  \r\n\r\nBoth cards are priced to move and include delivery.  Don't have much wiggle room on them unless you buy both for $50 dlvd.\r\n\r\nPayments are net to me via PayPal at [url]andysargent1@hotmail.com[/url] \r\n\r\nThank you all for looking!!!",
