      "post_content": "Please see my final post in this thread for an important update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n444 Cards Remain from the January thread and are still largely available, but I thought trying a new twist might be helpful.\r\n\r\nEach week, on Saturday or Sunday, I am going to list 8 random cards with scans and prices.  For 7 days only the posted cards will be available for 10% off the listed price (with no fee payment) with free shipping.  After 7 days the discount and the scans will disappear together and eight more random cards will be posted in this post.\r\n\r\nTherefore if you see a scan the ten percent discount is the price you pay.\r\n\r\nFeel free to express interest in any other cards on my collector focus tobacco road  collection in the T206 categories and I will give you a price. \r\n\r\nWeek 1\r\n\r\nPaul Davidson Piedmont 350 PSA 5 - $117 \r\nEd Greminger (SL) Piedmont 350 PSA 3 - $144 \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/10356/davidson[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/46377/greminger-sl[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLee Tannehill (No L) Piedmont 350/460 SGC 5 - $126\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/50556/tannehill-no-l[/IMG]\r\n\r\nJack Powell (Horiz) Sweet Cap 150 NY BVG 5 - $135 \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10166/powell[/IMG]",
