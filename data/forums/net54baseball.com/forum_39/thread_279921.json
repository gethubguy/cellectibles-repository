I'm guessing it was either neatly hand-cut from a sheet, or an odd factory cut (like the Lennox).\n\nThe scan of Lennox and Seitz together was taken as one scan with them side-by-side so you can see the difference in shade of the Piedmont backs.\n\nSeymour $38\n\nLennox cool factory miscut (I believe the blades got dull and slipped causing the curvy cuts that mirror each other on both sides) $100\n\nSeitz hand-cut scrap with wavy borders and double or triple printed Piedmont 350 back (ink is so dark it looks almost black) $850",
