      "post_content": "Price just reduced.... I have been on the N54 board for over 11 years with NO negative B/S/T transactions, and I guarantee this is a fantastic card!!! Please look closely at this card, NOT the holder that has encapsulated it for 30 years.... Card measures out fully, both ways, no signs of trimming even under a glass.... Yes, if you crack it out it's a gamble, but please magnify these pics for yourselves.... If this card was just a PSA 6.5, it would easily be a $11-12K card....  I dont know if this card was removed from an album, but above the word Polar there appears to be two tiny specks of stray paper. The streaks on the back are glare from the camera, not on the card.. I know there may be reservations because it's PRO grading, but this overall is a very, very solid and strong card. I have owned this card for about 25 years along with my collection of mostly PSA 7's and 8's, card is priced at $3000 which is a fantastic value for this card....I might consider a cash and trade deal....**SOLD**\r\n\r\nI don't know why the forum keeps making them so small.

Not many of us are shotgun collectors trying to buy anything and everything all at once.\nI would never have expected that a long-serving board member like Kevin had any relationship with a very new Poster on the board.\n\nAs the hobby continues to have even more and more money involved, it's hard knowing that some folks are coming into the hobby for profit.\nNet54 has been an incredible oasis to get away from that sort of thing.  Most of the collectors on here are good to their word, buy at stated prices, and if negotiations occur they are quick and honest.\nI'd hate to see the board change to get away from that sort of thing in any way.  There are few enough places now where collectors can cut through the BS and fake Ego and just buy good cards.\n\nVery best to Kevin in the sale of this card and all others.  Never for a minute did I have any question about his intentions or integrity in this matter.  --JB\n\n|",
