      "post_content": "EDIT-6/12/2020\n\nI'm just getting started with building my own personal collection of T206 cards, so I'm new to the site.  I'm on a limited budget, so I'm really only looking for low grade cards with decent eye appeal (ideally PSA graded, because I'm working on a display).\n\nHere is the list I'm working with:\n\nTy Cobb (Red or Green Portrait)\nChristy Mathewson (Dark Cap)\nEddie Collins\nTris Speaker\n\n[Strike]Cy Young (Portrait) - PURCHASED\n[STRIKE]Nap Lajoie (w/Bat) - PURCHASED\n[STRIKE]Home Run Baker - PURCHASED\n[STRIKE]Wajo (Portrait) - PURCHASED\n[STRIKE]John McGraw (Glove at Hip) - PURCHASED\n\nPlease PM me, or email me at [url]williammkoehler@gmail.com[/url].  I'm happy to do FF or standard Paypal with 3%.\n\nThanks for your consideration!\nBK",
