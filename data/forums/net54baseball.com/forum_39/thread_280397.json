You pick.\r\n\r\nEach HOF is $100, except Lajoie which will be $260.\r\n\r\nThese cards are all low grade, Lajoie appears about G/VG but has paperloss on the front. I cannot make any guarantees if there are trimmed cards etc. I am pretty sure the Evers portrait was an \"A\". It appears the bottom of Clarke (Portrait) is trimmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease add $10 US shipping for 1 or 2 cards.\r\n\r\nBuy 3 or more and shipping is free.\r\n\r\n\r\nPP FF \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL SOLD",
