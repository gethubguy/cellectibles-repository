      "post_content": "Looking to add some additional backs to my T206 Boston AL collection. I am interested in both graded and ungraded. I\u2019m pretty flexible on condition, but try to avoid heavy paper loss and creasing (corners and surface creasing I\u2019m not too concerned about). Below is what I have already. I\u2019d be particularly interested in any more rare backs. I\u2019m not a high roller on this stuff, so looking mainly in the $120 and under range.
