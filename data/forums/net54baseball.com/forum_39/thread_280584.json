      "post_content": "Walter Johnson Hands at Chest Lenox SGC 40. One of five total graded by SGC & PSA. This is tied for highest graded with one other, but clearly much nicer, scans of the other which sold in REA in 2006 are online. The offered card would have graded higher were it not for the diamond cut, which many Lenox backs have from this same sheet. \n\nFor those that demand rarity and the absolute best this is for you.",
