The Kruger, although that is a heavy crease dead center, about 3 mm of it is a tear.  It goes from the top border and stops above his hair.",

While I dont mind paper loss on my T206s I do stay away from tears and missing pieces of the card. For that reason I will pass on the lot, however if you decide to break it up, I am a buyer on the Stanage at 17 shipped PWE. Either way, have a great night!\r\n\r\nEd",
