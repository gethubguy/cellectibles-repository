      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T206 cards for sale or trade. As the scans will show, these all are low grade cards and obviously have major paper loss on the backs, although most fronts present well.\r\n\r\nPlease add $3 shipping for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Payment via any method you prefer. Please send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nCARDS PICTURED:\r\n\r\n**ALL CARDS SOLD. THANK YOU!**",
