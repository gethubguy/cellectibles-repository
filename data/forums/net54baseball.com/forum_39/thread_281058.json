      "post_content": "After working on my T206 collection of Cubs for a number of years, my collecting interests have shifted over time and I would like to focus my collecting elsewhere.  All cards listed will have high resolution scans of fronts and backs available hopefully by this evening and I will be happy to email scans of any cards to prospective buyers (Scans are attached of all available cards as of this am).  I am open to reasonable offers and will be willing to discount for any purchases over 3 cards.  All cards will ship via USPS with tracking and insurance at no extra charge.  Payment via Paypal, or other arrangements can possibly be made.\n\nEmail any requests for scans to [url]stevea@tractorpartsasap.com[/url]\n\n\"I'll take it\" will take precedence over any cards that are in negotiation with buyers and they will be considered SOLD at that point. All cards will be sold on a first come first serve basis.  Emails will be answered in the order they are received.\n\nThe only trades I will consider at this time are for Gabby Hartnett cards I do not currently have, or 1939-46 Salutation Exhibit Cards that I need to complete my set (Very short list)\n\nAny questions, feel free to email me,\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\nMordecai Brown (Chi.
