Card is super cool and unique, being listed as unconfirmed in t206resource.  Card also has the cool red face ghosting.  \n\nYou can also see the remnants of a wet sheet transfer of his face and his buttons on the back.\n\nAnyway, entertaining offers for graded HOFers and EPDG\u2019s, especially ones I need or which would be upgrades for my current group. Will also consider trades for SILVER and GOLD.  Just let me know what you have.\n\nShoot me a PM.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iLrNw4][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49729717711_715e840acf_c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iLp1j5][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49729172048_a96a868ca5_c.jpg[/img][/url]",

Been hesitant sending him for grading as it seems the SGC backlog is loooooong.....many folks waiting well beyond their estimated turnaround time.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if anyone is interested in trading for this guy, please let me know.",
