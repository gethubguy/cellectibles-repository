      "post_content": "$2050 net to me delivered with insurance. Price is really still the same, just checking to see if anyone was paying attention.:D\r\n\r\nThis was recently cracked out of the PSA slab. The picture in the holder shows the PSA flip. Card is well centered with amazing eye appeal.\r\n\r\nCards I would be interested in for partial trades. Looking for a authentic altered or lower end T206 Red Cobb with a Old Mill back, T213 Red Cobb beater, 1952 Topps Eddie Mathews beater, or a SGC 7 or better 1959 Fleer Ted Williams #68. \r\n\r\nI would also do several lesser value cards or a cards/cash deal. I need some T210 Series 3 Ft Worth cards. I would also trade for a few to several T206s as long as a beater Red Cobb(any Back) is part of the trade.",
