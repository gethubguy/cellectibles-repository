      "post_content": "$60 net to me for the American Beauty box. The EPDG BOX IS SOLD. \n\nT206 did not come in these, but they are cool display pieces. The EPDG metal boxes usually have more rust on them. \n\nThe lid of the AB cigar box is fully detached, but looking online I was not able to find another example.",
