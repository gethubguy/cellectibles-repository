It\u2019s graded a 1 but it\u2019s actually a pretty decent 1 with no loss in the back. \r\n\r\nLooking for EPDGs of Hummel, Congalton, or Bowerman preferably if anyone has one. Otherwise would be interested in possible upgrades I need. Just shoot me a PM with what you have.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iQQEUm][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49779445652_298eca0c78_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2iQLfe8][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49778582193_12553755bc_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
