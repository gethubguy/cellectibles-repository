Had 6 hits.  \n\nAbstein played for the Buccos in the 1909 World Series. \n\nKitty has been loved well. Probably VG. Abstein presents very nicely. Had a couple of barely noticing flecks on the surface loss on the back. And and very slight bend in the top that was unnoticed by me for years until is out a flashlight on it for this listing.  Has fat borders, nice edges, decent corners, and great color and gloss. \n\n$75 shipped for the pair via PayPal f/f or add 3% for fees. \n\nHappy to answer questions. Pm is best.\n\nPayPal email [url]jcfowler6@zoominternet.net[/url]\n\nRegards\n\nJon\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
