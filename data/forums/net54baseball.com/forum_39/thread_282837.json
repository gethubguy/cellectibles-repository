Which is great because I wasn't ready to part with my PSA 4. I still can't believe I only paid $357 four years ago for it. And I remember at the time not feeling comfortable paying that much because I really didn't need a PSA 4 grade to keep me happy. Crazy how much things change in just 4 years.",
