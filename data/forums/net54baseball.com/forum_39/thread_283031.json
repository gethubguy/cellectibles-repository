Also has a teeny circular paper pull on the reverse, right side. Displays an angle cut.\r\n\r\nJoss has a few light surface wrinkles on the front left corner and what looks to be a tiny pin hole at the very edge of the top border. Hard to see with the naked eye, but its there. \r\n\r\nAddie was graded a Psa 1, but I cracked it and placed it into a top loader since it presented far better raw than it did in that silly slab. Just a pretty card!\r\n\r\n$220 bucks (delivered) takes the pair. Payment by PayPal FF preferred.\r\n\r\nFirst one to post here that they'll take em, gets em both. Thanks all, Tony\r\n\r\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/lumleyjossfronts.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/lumleyjossbacks.jpg[/IMG]",
