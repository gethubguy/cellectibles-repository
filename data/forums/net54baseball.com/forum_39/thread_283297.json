Do you have your set listed in Scot Reader's T206 Insider Registry?[/QUOTE]\n\nScot's work and website are amazing, although my set is not listed on there presently.\nHe has very kindly 'contributed' a handful of tough cards to my own set, though, and he has been such a pleasure getting to know!\n\nMy PSA cards are listed on the PSA Registry T206 set of 520 under my screen name here, with all photos uploaded.  Feel free to check it out!\n|",
