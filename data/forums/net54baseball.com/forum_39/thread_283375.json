It is cheaper, and the turnaround time is probably identical.  Good luck.",

Plus for pre-war/vintage, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the preferred grader by many. \n\nGot a recent SGC 20 day sub back in 20 days. I have 2 PSA subs going on 5 and 6 months that still aren\u2019t done.",

      "post_content": "I personally prefer SGC much more than PSA for anything pre-1933.\r\n\r\nPSA uses that mylar layer at their discretion which i think displays \u201cnot so well.\u201d And for T206s they seem to use it a lot. I even offered to pay them to remove the mylar from my cards and they said no. So that was cool. \r\n\r\nSGC has great customer service but i think they should stop changing their presentations/flips so often. I like the SGC flips with the smaller numbers much more. \r\n\r\nNeither company is perfect, but i find dealing with SGC to be actually consistently enjoyable, and dealing with PSA to be consistently aggravating.",

Emailed SGC twice already with no response. Safety comes first and it\u2019s just cards \u2013 so I wait. I also gave up sending to PSA at this time, even before Jan. of this year due to wait times.
