      "post_content": "For sale is this t206 of Foster with an Old Mill back. I would grade the card GOOD with tobacco stains and a weird upper boarder color 'halo' that some members believe could be a chemical stain of some sort. If not for these issues, I would grade the card VG-EX as it has nice centering, good color and an upper left dinged corner. \r\n\r\n$Sent to Ebay\r\n\r\nPrice includes shipping. Payment via Paypal 'Gift' or price plus 3% for regular Paypal ONLY. Please PM me to buy or with questions. Thanks.........Matt",
