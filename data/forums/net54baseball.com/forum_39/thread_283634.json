One UI item that would be nice is when you drill down to specific cards -> Player by last name -> Letter -> then select a player, there is no path back to that letter, or even back to the alphabetical list. You need to go all the way back to the home screen. It would be nice to simply go one screen back after you've viewed the player.",

Chris (slantycouch) and I do have some T206 related product ideas, but they're going to take some time to plan and execute (this is not our day job, naturally... more a labor of love in our spare time).\n\nThanks again!",
