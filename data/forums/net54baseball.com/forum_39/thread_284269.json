      "post_content": "Hello,\r\nI have been looking to knockout one of the two Cobbs I still need for my set (I am at 482/520 but a long way to go lol) - i'd like to see what is out there for sale for a bat on or a bat off.  I would like a 1.5 or a 2 (possibly better if the right card/price) and prefer sgc over psa but either is fine - I am not freaked by older labels but look at the card over the grade. \r\n\r\nAlso, if I cant find a decent t206, I am also on the look out for a Cobb t205 (in off back) but I can post that in the t205 forum if I dont find the right t206)\r\n\r\nI have plenty of references on Tobacco Row if needed as I am just digging in here at net 54. \r\n\r\nAny replies are appreciated.  Thanks!",
