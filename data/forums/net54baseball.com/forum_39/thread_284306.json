      "post_content": "I've been a baseball card collector since I was 12 years of age.  Over the past few decades, I've been fortunate in having been able to build a really robust and valuable collection of cards.  But, the one card I have always wanted to have is the t206 Wagner.  I still remember hearing about that card for the first time when Wayne Gretzky bought the best example back in 1988 or so.  Since that very day, I made a vow to myself to one day have an example of that card.  Obviously, I am far from the only person to have wanted that card over the years :-).\n\nBut now, having been blessed with a good career and the ability to have put away some savings earmarked for that card, I'm wondering if anyone knows of private collectors that might be willing to part with one.  Of course, I watch all the auction houses as well, and regrettably passed on the Original Wagner (was insanely busy at work at that time), but would be very thankful if anyone here has a lead.\n\nBest,\nRob",

      "post_content": "Welcome to the board.  There are a few collectors on this site that have/had Wagners, but generally none of them broadcast it.  If you stick around and do your own research, you can find out who a few are, but not sure any would be open to selling.  \r\n\r\nI don't mean this to be rude, but I also don't think you will find many people who are going to just give a random guy on a message board a lead on a $1mm card without a lot more detail on who you are.  If you're really serious about a card like that, I would speak to the folks at the major auction houses and make them aware of what you are looking for.  They will likely already know multiple people who own one, would potentially have interest in selling, and they can work to facilitate the sale and keep both you and the seller anonymous.\r\n\r\nGood luck in your search!\r\n\r\nDJ",
