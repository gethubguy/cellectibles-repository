I am a realist and an ordinary guy, but have been collecting 206 for many years....I am at the point of hoping for a trade for just a piece of the Wagner, a 1/2 or 1/4 wagner, or something of that nature....I'm not sure if they even exist??? I have seen on the resource the die cut and 1/2 wagner ect....i can not even dream of an A or anything close like that, but just looking for a piece of the card...\r\n\r\n\r\nbig longshot.....\r\n\r\nif you, or anyone you can put me in touch, please pm me...\r\n\r\nThanks a ton\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nJohnny",
