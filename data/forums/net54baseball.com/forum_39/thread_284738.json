      "post_content": "Hello--\r\n\r\nI am selling my T206 Walter Johnson portrait with Piedmont 150 back. This card was graded by SGC just two weeks ago. The card has significant eye appeal despite its SGC grade of 1.\r\n\r\nI am asking $1,100 for the card. I will pay for shipping and insurance. Payment through PP F&F or another arrangement should you prefer.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a PM to show interest or ask questions. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\n--Dan",
