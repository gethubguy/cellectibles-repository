I\u2019ve had multiple offers and will give it until 9 a.m. tomorrow before deciding whether to accept the best one. \r\n\r\nThe first to respond I\u2019ll take it will take precedence over PM\u2019s. \r\nPlease see my EBay listing with pics and other details. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll pay shipping and insurance through USPS Registered Mail. \r\nThanks",
