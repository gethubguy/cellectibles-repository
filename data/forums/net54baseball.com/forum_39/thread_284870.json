      "post_content": "I am looking to buy low grade T206 with perfect registration and centering. Eye appeal is everything! The 1s, 2s, and 3s that look like 4s, 5s, 6s. Back damage is fine. No trim jobs. Will pay well.\n\nPlease email or message me if you have anything for sale that look like the below cards (personal collection, not for sale).\n\nI'm set building so my want list is long.\n\nThank you!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/v688bpZ.png[/img]",
