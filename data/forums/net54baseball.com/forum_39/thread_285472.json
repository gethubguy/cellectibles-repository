But think about it, why would anyone seeking to sell a card like this keep it in a GAI flip?  This card in a PSA or SGC flip, even if downgraded to a 4, sells quickly and for a lot of money.  But in a GAI flip, it just sits bc everyone wonders why is it still in that flip -- whats wrong with it?  I have to believe that if the owner really wanted to sell this, he would have tried to cross it, and because it remains in a GAI flip, he was unsuccessful.",

It's probably known and was either a previous crossover attempt, or one that was obvious enough to avoid trying.  The thumb sized dark spot on the back (very top) could be one such issue.  Hard to tell if it's staining or more.  There could be a bit of paper loss somewhere too.",
