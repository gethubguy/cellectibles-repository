Ideally, I would like to acquire an entire graded set, preferably PSA but would consider SGC, and preferably in Mid-Grade (3-6).  \r\n\r\nI would also buy larger graded collections and assemble myself, as I already own the Big 4 and all of the big HOFers.  \r\n\r\nPlease email or PM me if you have something to sell.\r\n\r\nRyan",
