      "post_content": "Finally at 518/520 in PSA 4.0 - 5.0 for the Monster, with just a few things to clean up for the set.  The last 2 cards are Cobb (Bat Off) and McCauley (SL).\r\n\r\nDecided to go for a full PSA set, and so I need PSA copies of Cobb (Red, Bat On, Bat Off) in PSA 4/4.5/5.\r\n\r\nI have a very strong, dead-centered SGC 5 Red Cobb that I would move to acquire any one of the 3 Cobbs on my list.  \r\nI also have a nice SGC 5 E90-1 Cy Young that I am open to moving to help with my last T206 needs.  These two cards are not for sale, only up for trades that help with the T206 set.\r\n\r\nOutside of the Cobbs, just need a Lajoie (Throwing) and Bender (w/ Trees) in PSA 4.0 -5.0 to replace SGC copies.  Happy to buy these outright if you have them.\r\n\r\nSee pics below -- Any and all help is appreciated!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=408066&d=1593831811[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=408067&d=1593831817[/IMG]",
