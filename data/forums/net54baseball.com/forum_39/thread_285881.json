      "post_content": "After achieving a Monster Number of over 500, I've decided that completing the Monster would be too expensive a proposition, and one that no longer really interests me. So I'm going to start a major downsizing operation on my T206s, keeping only what really interests me -- my Cubs and White Sox team sets, most of my tough backs, top-tier HOFers, and a few cards that I just like the look of. I'm going to list most of the rest on here, starting with the letter A. These are all raw, but I have some graded cards I will be listing too.\r\n\r\nPrices are net to me, PayPal F&F preferred. PM if interested. Add $3 shipping for any number of cards up to $100; above that, free shipping.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/gg98/dkathman1/04EB8A43_4207_4F28_9ABB_368E967BF025.jpeg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/gg98/dkathman1/6EB12D27_746D_42D2_84F4_3F64E29D10C5.jpeg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAbbaticchio brown sleeves: $35\r\nAbbott: $30\r\nAbstein: $40\r\nAdkins: $25\r\nAmes portrait: $30\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/gg98/dkathman1/346A7661_1CE3_49BC_8553_624E78A7EA86.jpeg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/gg98/dkathman1/09DD0D6B_2D31_4BEC_B9B3_277436F8010B.jpeg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAmes hands in front: $30\r\nAnderson: $25\r\nArellanes: $25\r\nArmbruster: $30\r\nArndt: $20",
