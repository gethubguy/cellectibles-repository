      "post_content": "In the first thread of this series, I mentioned how, after achieving a Monster Number of over 500, I've decided to downsize my T206 collection to focus on tough backs (of which I have many), Cubs and White Sox (of which I have both team sets), top-tier HOFers, and a few nice cards that I just like. I'm selling the rest, starting with the letter A in that first post:\n\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=285881[/url]\n\nI posted cards starting with B here the other day. Now I'm reducing the prices on the cards that remain, and adding new cards starting with letter C in a new post. Prices are listed after each picture, PayPal F&F preferred. PM me if interested. Please add $3 for shipping for any number of cards up to $100, after which shipping is free.\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50156827188_4131f9167d_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50157382561_5a00847035_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBarbeau 25\nBarry 50 (SOLD)\nBastian (SL) 80 (SOLD)\nBeaumont 40 (SOLD)\nBell 35\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50156829023_dd27a218c7_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50157620507_938499c2bc_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBergen 22\nBirmingham 25 (SOLD)\nBlackburne 35 (SOLD)\nBrain 27 (SOLD)\nBransfield 20\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50157384671_ba8eb2bc90_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50156831098_3aaeb96bb5_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBresnahan (HOF) 60 (SOLD)\nBurchell 30 (SOLD)\nBurke 22\nByrne 35 (SOLD)",
