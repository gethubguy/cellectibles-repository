      "post_content": "In the first thread of this series, I mentioned how, after achieving a Monster Number of over 500, I've decided to downsize my T206 collection to focus on tough backs (of which I have many), Cubs and White Sox (of which I have both team sets), top-tier HOFers, and a few nice cards that I just like. I'm selling the rest, starting with the letter A in that first post:\n\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=285881[/url]\n\nI posted cards starting with B in a separate post the other day, and now I'm adding new cards starting with letter C in this post. Prices are listed after each picture, PayPal F&F preferred. PM me if interested. Please add $3 for shipping for any number of cards up to $100, after which shipping is free.\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50167826043_f547b22f9d_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168360941_abb9a8066f_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nClarke portrait (HOF)(trimmed) 50 (SOLD)\nClarke batting (HOF) 75 (SOLD)\nJ.
