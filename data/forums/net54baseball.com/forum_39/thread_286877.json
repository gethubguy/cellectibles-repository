      "post_content": "Offered here is a beautiful, crease free Murphy Horizontal pose. It is 1/16 short top to bottom. Instead of 2 5/8\" it is  hair short an closer to 2 9/16\" . It has a Piedmont 350 back which is clean. It is still a great card but I believe it would not grade . The width is correct. If it is trimmed my guess is it is on the bottom where the border is smaller and close to the name. No charge for USPS first class mail if paid by paypal f & F\n$49.00 sold",
