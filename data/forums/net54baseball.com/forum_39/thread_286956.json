      "post_content": "Hi - selling the pictured T206 Marquard portrait.  Centering looks awesome, corners are pretty nice on it as well, and it has those nice big borders we all like to look for.  There are a series of light creases across the card, which you should be able to see in the scans here.  PM me if you want me to email you bigger pics.\r\n\r\nPrice is $135 delivered - PayPal F/F preferred but happy to take whatever.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\nScott",
