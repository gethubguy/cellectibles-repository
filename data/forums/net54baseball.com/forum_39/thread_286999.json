Make me an offer, especially if you\u2019re interested in multiple cards. \n\nEdited to add: I've added a new card below (a cheap but presentable beater) and lowered prices on the remaining cards. Let's move these!\n\nMy sale of many of my T206s continues with players starting with the letter D, plus the B and C cards that have not yet sold. Here is the previous post in the series:\n\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=286773[/url]\n\nAs before, please PM me if interested, or with any questions. PayPal F&F preferred.
