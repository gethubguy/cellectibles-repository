Photos are also below. \r\n\r\nI've had lots of inquires about these T-card and Goudey frames. I've found the only way to get them to a reasonable cost is to order in large quantities. I'm offering pre-order for various quantities, at a discounted price, in hopes of meeting the minimums required. I recognize this cost still may not appeal to some. It's truly surprising how hard it is to source suitable stock at a reasonable price. \r\n\r\nThese are 100% acid free and made to hold a single card in a standard size top loader. Please find available quantities and order details [URL=\"https://www.prewarprints.com/#4\"]here[/URL]. \r\n\r\n** Pre-order until 8/31. I expect all frame orders to begin shipping in early-October.**\r\n\r\nNoting that I do not have any additional sizes or styles at this time. Depending on the demand for these I can certainly consider that in the future. \r\n\r\nThanks for the interest! Feel free to contact me with questions. \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/SnrwC0F/IMG-1135.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/55zpRbG/IMG-1136.jpg[/IMG]",
