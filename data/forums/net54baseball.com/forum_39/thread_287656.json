      "post_content": "Hi all, adding something to [url]www.prewarprints.com[/url] that I hope the binder collectors will find useful. \r\n\r\nThese are custom designed and cut-to-size placeholder cards for the Big Four, plus O'Hara and Demmitt, and also blank front placeholder cards with subtle Sweet Cap and Piedmont backs. Just enough design to fit in your collection without taking away from the real cards. \r\n\r\nAvailable as a package of the 6 image cards, plus two blanks, and then blanks only in packages of 25 and 50. \r\n\r\nI will begin shipping these Friday, 8/21. Photos below. Purchase details [URL=\"https://www.prewarprints.com/#4\"]here[/URL]. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/qyRPfVM/all-t206-placeholders-no-package.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/ZdJHy0c/t206-big-four-placeholder-cards-in-package.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/ypQzsmv/t206-placeholder-cards-in-binder-page.jpg[/IMG]",
