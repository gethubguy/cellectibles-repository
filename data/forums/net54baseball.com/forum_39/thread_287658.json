      "post_content": "Hello all T-206 collectors - \r\n\r\nAbout a year ago I wrote about having a Blue Old Mill back in my collection.  This card is unique because its face is an Elberfeld Washington portrait while its back is a BLUE Old Mill back.  To the best of my knowledge only 3 blue Old Mill backs exist and only 2 of these have been authenticated and graded.  This card is one of those.  \r\n\r\nI've decided to put my card up for auction at the next REA auction in December.  So if you want to add a unique T-206 card for your collection, be on the look out for it.  \r\n\r\nHappy collecting and best regards to all.  Howard\r\n\r\nPS  Apologies to Leon for posting this in the wrong place at first.  Hope this time I got it right.",

It could have been a lazy worker that didn't clean up the Piedmont blue ink before adding the Old Mill black ink. So the first and maybe the second sheet came out in blue.
