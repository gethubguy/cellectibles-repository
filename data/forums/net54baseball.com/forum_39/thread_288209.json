      "post_content": "Finally at 519/520 in PSA 4.0 - 5.0 for the Monster, with just a few things to clean up for the set.\nLast card is the Bat Off Cobb, and then have 4 others that I need to move from SGC to PSA for a complete PSA set of 520.\n\nOffered is this beautiful, dead-centered SGC 5 Red Cobb that I would trade to acquire either of the 2 Cobbs on my list (Red or Bat Off) in PSA 4 - 5 grade.  Cash to even it out, whatever is fair.\nAlso have some other in-demand (Non-PreWar) cards in the hobby that I am considering moving as well (See Pics).  Willing to build them into a trade as well.\n\nI am not considering an outright sale on the Red Cobb.\n\nOutside of the Cobbs, just need a Lajoie (Throwing), Bender (w/ Trees), and a Tom Needham in PSA 4.0 -5.0 to replace SGC copies.  Happy to buy these outright if you have them.\n\nSee pics below -- all help is appreciated!\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=415914&d=1598722910[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=415915&d=1598722913[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=415917&d=1598722927[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=415916&d=1598722924[/IMG]",
