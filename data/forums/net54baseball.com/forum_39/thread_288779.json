      "post_content": "I'm finally back with more T206s for sale. I've been drastically downsizing my T206 collection, keeping only the top-tier HOFers, Cubs and White Sox, and tough backs. In previous posts I sold cards starting with the letters A, B, C, and D, and now it's time for letters E through H. I've already sold a bunch, and these are the ones that remain from those letters. At the bottom I've also included the eight cards remaining from the letters B, C, and D.\n\nPlease PM if interested, or with any questions. PayPal Friends & Family preferred for payment. Add $3 shipping for any number of cards up to $100; free shipping for orders over $100.\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50322023427_72446b6f77_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321174093_0011d008cf_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEgan 30 (SOLD)\nEwing 30 (SOLD)\nGanzel 35\nGraham 20 (SOLD)\nHannifan (DOUBLE NAME) 50 (SOLD)\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321846066_41ae69cf58_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321846486_1e60b61a3d_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHemphill 30 (SOLD)\nHinchman Cleveland 30\nHinchman Toledo (PSA 2) 40 (SOLD)\nHoblitzell 35 (SOLD)\nHowell 40 (SOLD)\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321847086_00da166eb1_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50322025647_87d443d64b_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBarbeau 22 (SOLD)\nChappelle 32 (SOLD)\nCharles 22 (SOLD)\nClark 30\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321176528_cf72bfd078_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50321848336_1d084367fc_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nCross 25\nDoolan 22 (SOLD)\nDunn 22 (SOLD)\nDygert 45",
