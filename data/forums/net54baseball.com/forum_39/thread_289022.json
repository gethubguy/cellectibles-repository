Don't accept (for example) PM offers by people looking to talk down the card, make a low-ball offer, and then try to sell it for significantly more money later.  Ironically, when they go to sell it, they'll downplay the mark and hype the good qualities of the card.  I've seen it all too often.  Again, auction the card.  Don't get ripped off.",

Appreciate the tips.[/QUOTE]Yes auction would show the true value of the card. But remember that \"true value\" is 20-28%(depending on tax) more than the hammer price.  And you do not see any of that, plus have to pay a consignment fee yourself.\n\nI agree the card would sell for around the same of 2.5 to 3 with the marks. \n\nIt sold in Dec 2018 for $500, at that time that was between the price of a 2.5 and 3 most likely. I would assume the same would be true today.\n\nBest of luck whatever you decided.\n\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk",
