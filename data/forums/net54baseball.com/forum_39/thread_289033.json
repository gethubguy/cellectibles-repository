They include a Southern Leaguer (Thebo) and a HOFer (Willis) which are graded SGC 20 and 10 respectively, but which both look nicer than their grades.\n\nAs before, please PM me if interested. PayPal F&F preferred for payment. Add $3 shipping except for orders over $100, for which shipping is free.\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50339186063_b2182d1f00_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50339875661_d3b3e38b3a_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLeach PSA 3.5: 55 (SOLD)\nMiller PSA 4: 65 (SOLD)\n\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50340031132_885809861e_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50339876931_83b920dab8_b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nJordan batting SGC 45: 55 (SOLD)\nThebo (SL) SGC 20 (erasure on front): 75\nWillis (HOF) SGC 10: 100 (SOLD)",
