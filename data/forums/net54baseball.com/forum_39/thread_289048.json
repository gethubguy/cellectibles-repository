My favorite back ...... :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically the last 3 SLs I need -- Ellam, Foster, Mullaney.\r\n\r\nIn general, anything I don't already have (sitting at 70 right now).\r\n\r\nI'd be looking for lower grade.  So not to waste anyone's time, my price range would be up to $400 on commons, and up to $700 on HOF/SL.\r\n\r\nAll I have to trade is on my ebay -- sg713.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=418297&d=1600100761[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=418298&d=1600100769[/IMG]",
