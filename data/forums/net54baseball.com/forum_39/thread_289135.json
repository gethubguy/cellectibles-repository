I thought there was a typo or something in his listing - that's the mistake I thought we were talking about - not that he listed something, researched it more a couple hours after it was sold and paid for and THEN decided to back out of the deal and cancel the transaction. While I can appreciate that he kicked down a 20-spot, IMO the right thing to do would be to follow-through with the transaction, even if it meant taking a 200$ equity loss on it. Gotta do the research before you post. That said, and perhaps it's mearly a linguistics issue, I dont necessarily think that \"scammer\" is the right word. But it's 100% bad form to back out of a deal you made because you decide to research it later. I think buyer's case could've been better articulated in this thread rather than the fury and aggressive words, but as far as the deal is concerned, buyer is right to be pissed off.",
