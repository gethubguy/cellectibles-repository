      "post_content": "I\u2019ve been selling too much 50s, 60s and 70s.  Time to get back to basics with a good \u2018ol T card listing.  \n\nT206 Drum Murphy Batting (trimmed) SGC - Authentic - Trades for Mid grade 52T Robinson, 51B Mays, Or Cobbs considered \n\nT206 Tolstoi - Cy Young Glove - PSA 4.5 - tiny stain at top - corners are exmt. $5200\nT206 Hindu F. Jones.  PSA says 2 - not sure what they see here I was hoping for a 3.5 or 4.  $650\nT206 AB460 L. Tannehill PSA 3 - dramatically undergrads perhaps a tiny stain on reverse?  I would grade it Ex+ $500\nT213-1 \u201cCoupon\u201d Wilson.  Poor but complete. Three spots of paper loss on back.  Some folks attribute these to T206 - and would be about as tough as Carolina Brights.  Personally I think it\u2019s a separate issue.  $375\nT206 Sov460 Duffy PSA 3 $475\nT206 Cycle 350 Maddox SGC 40/3 - Centered, nice card $325\nT206 Jennings Two Hands AB350 NF PSA 6MC - typically off center for the issue $1400\nT206 Huggins AB350 Frame PSA 3.5 $550\nT206 Ford Sov460 PSA 3 spot of paper loss on front - $95 over graded to be honest. \nT206 Clancy AB350 Frame PSA 6 MC - nearly perfect centering - I guess it\u2019s the slight oc on the back?  If it doesn\u2019t sell will probably submit to SGC - IMO doesn\u2019t deserve a qualifier - $650\nT206 Chase Portrait (blue) P350 Ex+. $275\nT206 Devore Batting Sc 350-460 F42 - accurately graded $80\n\n\nAll prices are net to me.  Orders under $100 kindly add $5 for shipping.",
