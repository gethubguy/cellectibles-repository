I'm going to start a raw, non-HOFer (want to keep this low dollar to start), non hat wearing, color gradient T206 portrait collection.\n\nI'd be looking for VG copies with good color, centering etc etc etc but I'm not going to be too picky. Just nothing with any egregious defects on the front. I'm not looking to buy too many in one shot (1-3 at a time) and spread it out and take my time. \n\nPM or email [url]adamwanaselja@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks for looking.",
