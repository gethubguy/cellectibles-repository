      "post_content": "So I\u2019ve been thinking...Id really like to add a Cobb to my collection. Likely a Red or Bat On/Off are going to be in my price range, condition of a 1 or A with a strong presenting front, full card, I don\u2019t really care about the back. My plan isn\u2019t set in stone, but I\u2019d like to evaluate some options. I have a bunch of trade items \u2014 I\u2019d want to work a cash and trade deal if possible. Am I crazy? Probably, but it would be nice to have at least 1 copy of the big dog 6 HOFers in the t206 set.",
