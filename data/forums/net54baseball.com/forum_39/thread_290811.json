      "post_content": "I am looking for high end Polar Bears, PSA4 up to PSA 6.  I am paying a nice premium for them right now.  I know a bunch of 4 to 6s sold on ebay over the last few weeks that I missed out on and I would pay more than the final prices on a lot of those by quite a bit.  +$100 for the 6s and +$50 for the 5s, maybe more depending on the card.  \r\n\r\nLet me know what all you have available, paypal ready and references available if needed.  Thanks, and happy collecting!  :)",
