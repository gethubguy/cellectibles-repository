      "post_content": "Boy oh Boy (as Grandpa Gross used to say), There seems to be quite a lull in mid-tier backs available these days .....  \n\nI \"think\" it's because there are so many new \"back\" collectors.  I'd say a year and a half ago, I could think of 3 or 4 collectors actively seeking these cards.  Now it seems there are 3 or 4 times that many.  The old double edge sword:  Great for the interest, not so great for availability. \n\nAnyway, my wants/needs are limited, but if you don't ask, you don't know .... ;)\n\nHere is what I'm looking for:\n\n1 -- SL Hindu -- Ellam, Foster, and Mullaney\n\n2 -- Any AB, Cycle, EPDG, or Tolstoi (as available):  Cross (:eek:), Knabe, McGlynn, Shaw, Prov., Taylor, Thomas.\n\n3 -- Any EPDG, Hindu, OM, or Sov.150 (as available):  Alperman, Mathewson/white, Pastorius (to replace SC150/649ops); Bridwell, no cap, Jones, hips, Lajoie, port.,  (to replace Sov.350s)\n\n4 -- Also any lower grade Hindus that I don't have ...........\n\n[url]mybuddyinc@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nEasy as that ----- :rolleyes:\n\nThanks, Scott",
