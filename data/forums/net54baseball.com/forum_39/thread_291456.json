List of names below.\n\nPlease PM me with asking price and pictures.  I don't typically check often but I did put an alarm to check on here every day mid-morning and evening (what can I say, I'm a dedicated wife haha) so please bear with me if there's a little delay before I respond.  Once I get on though, I can pay immediately if all is good to go!\n\nSome of the names he needs are:\n\nBurch (fielding)\nCassidy\nCharles\nConroy (Bat)\nCravath\nCriger\nDavidson\nDessau\nDonlin (field)\nDonlin (Seated)\nDonohue\nDooin\nDorner\nDougherty (portrait)\nDowney (field)\nDowns\nDubuc\nDunn (Balt)\nDygert\nEasterly\nEgan\nEngle\nEvans\nEwing\nFerguson\nFlanagan\nFletcher\nFord\nFromme\n\nThanks! \n\nJenni",
