      "post_content": "Offered here is a very sharp looking Cobb portrait. Graded a 1.5 by SGC mainly due to what looks liked a hand pressed letter of some kind. Bright colors, solid registration, and decent corners make this a perfect example of \"buy the card not the grade\" in my opinion. Have 2 other 06`s with same mark most likely from an old time collector. Please see enclosed scans and ask any questions via PM/email or post. 1`st \"I`ll take it\" is new owner. Asking XXXX net to me, through paypal. Ins priority shipping included. Thanx for looking............Murph\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2hXX5bX][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49203553363_dbe6477f90_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2hXX5bX]T 206 Red Cobb Portrait,   SGC  1.5[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/154296763@N05/]Hugh Murphy[/url], on Flickr \r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2k3L62P][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50570705981_d249d5af1b_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2k3L62P]Untitled[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/154296763@N05/]Hugh Murphy[/url], on Flickr",
