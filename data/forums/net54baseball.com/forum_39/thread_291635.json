      "post_content": "Hi All, I just joined this site, and have reached out via email to Leon to confirm I am legit. I would like to sell/purchase T206 cards, as it is something I have become very interested in, rather quickly over the last few months. I have a nice Cubs collection I have put together, and am looking to sell as I accidently went in a direction I did not intend to. Currently my set contains the following, although I have other cards, they are for my private collection. I would like to sell these cards as a set, and am right now open to offers for the set, or a reasonable offer for any of the cards below. I am versed on the value of what I have, based on the many aspects available online. I can email close ups of each card, as I now have pictures taken this morning, so you may take a closer look. I currently have the following and am only posting this for a week, before I go back to adding to the set:\n\nFrank Chance Batting Pose (Polar Bear) (Raw)   My guess is 1 or 1.5 if graded  ($180)\nJohnny Evers Batting Yellow   PSA 3   (Not in possession until next week) ($425)\nSolly Hofman PSA 4  ($230)\nJohnny Kling PSA 2  ($247)\nRube Kroh PSA 4   ($208)\nPat Moran  SGC 50/4   ($82)\nOrval Overall Portrait   PSA 2 ($145)\nOrval Overall Hands at Face    PSA 4  ($265)\nFrancis Pfeffer (2) PSA 4 and SGC 40/3  ($165 and $100)\nJake Pfeister Pitching   SGC 60/5   ($204)\nFrancis Pfeister  Sitting     Raw (Crease not visible, I will undergrade as a 2) ($110)\nEd Reulbach  SGC 30/2  ($193)\nJimmy Sheckard No Glove Showing    SGC 40/3   ($135)\nHarry Steinfeldt w/ Bat  PSA 4    ($189)\nHeinie Zimmerman  (Very nice!) SGC 50/4   ($177)\n\nRemember, there is a cost that goes in to grading, on top of the actual card value. I also offer free shipping, and pricing for the set would be lower than what I am asking for individual cards (Think 15%-27% discount for set) I am completely new to this (selling on this site is what I mean), and will be transparent. Looking for an offer to be made, and I will cover shipping cost via FedEx.  We can discuss payment transfer as well, and how to contact me.",
