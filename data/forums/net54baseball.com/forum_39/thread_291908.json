      "post_content": "Hi Everyone!   I am starting to think SGC grading is more accurate than PSA. Since I am new to collecting, I am curious what you, the experts think. Everyone is welcome to comment, as I think this will benefit us all. Looking forward to what everyone has to say. Also, PSA has a good population report, but I am struggling to find where SGC reports on cards. Any help is appreciated, and ALL FEEDBACK IS WELCOME!!!!",

And to me SGC is more consistent in their grading. That said, I'll still buy a nice looking PSA card. Just buy the card, not the grade.",
