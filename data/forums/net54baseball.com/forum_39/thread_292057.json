Probably see who comes close to what I am hoping for, and I am not basing my pricing off what I see on Ebay either.    I am asking something reasonable, but want to see what offers come in.   Thanks, James",

I\u2019m sure all the guys I\u2019ve been generous in selling to aren\u2019t complaining about me on here or eBay.  Thanks for the input though!!!  I\u2019m definitely not asking an arm and a leg, and would definitely like $2500 for it. It looks way better in person, and laying next to the PSA 3 I bought and sold for under what I paid, you can see how valuable it is.",
