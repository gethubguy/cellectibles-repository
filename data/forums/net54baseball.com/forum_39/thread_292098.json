I am open to considering any condition of unaltered card... but would prefer not to pay more than $40 for the most common front/back combinations, and would prefer not to have wrinkled faces. \r\n\r\nI obviously would be willing to spend a hair more for Dahlen and any other lower population front/back combinations (I do have a love for Polar Bears...but who doesn't?).\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration... and proud to be a member of such an awesome community. \r\n\r\nBK",
