      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently acquired a t206 bat on shoulder. It's in poor condition and currently at SGC being authenticated/graded (should be back next week). I'd like to float the idea of trading it potentially for one of the following:\n\nCobb Bat off shoulder\nCobb red portrait\nCobb green portrait\nJohnson portrait\nMathewson portrait\nYoung portrait\n\nTo be honest, I'd be the most excited/willing to trade it for another Cobb (and offset any difference with cash necessary)\n\nPlease email me at [url]wazywhoa@gmail.com[/url] for pics so we can discuss further. Thank you!\n\nWazoo",
