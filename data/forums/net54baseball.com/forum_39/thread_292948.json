I was looking at the top left of the page, which must have been their last auction they had. But yes, it ended in 2011. So maybe not a huge return for the time past, but the auction isn't over yet. 7 watchers and everyone loves to bid at the last second. Hope he pulls a good profit for his time in the card. That spot is probably just glare. The phone or camera was too close to the card when taking the picture. It's better to be one to two feet away from the card and then zoom in, to avoid reflections and blurry photos.",
