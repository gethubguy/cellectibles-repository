      "post_content": "T206 Red Cobb SC 460/30 PSA 2, which, I feel, presents much nicer than it's appointed grade... vivid color, fat borders, exceptional centering, no creases or any other hidden problems. Front appears to be a 3 or 3.5, but has 2 small spots of slight paper loss along border, as well as a minute tobacco stain on reverse.\r\nI also found this back to be one of the tougher red Cobb common f/b combinations as confirmed by Scot Reader's in-depth analysis from \"Inside T206.\" \r\nWould be willing to trade only for any similar condition (or better plus cash) Cobbs from my wantlist below, especially the Piedmont 350 (far & away the most common back, but the final piece to my realistic back run).\r\nAlso searching for \"Bat On\" with SC 350/25 and \"Bat Off\" with P 350 backs.\r\nAny assistance that can be offered to help an old-timer complete a 40+ year old project would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks for looking!",
