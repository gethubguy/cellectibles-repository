      "post_content": "We are hosting our first Not for Profit T206 Set Break Auction at [url]www.T206Cards.com[/url] which features over 800 individual T206 cards in varying grades.  \r\n\r\nThe intent of our auctions are to acquire large T206 collections and offer them back to the collecting community with out seeking to profit from the individual card sale.  All proceeds from the auction cover the cost of the set purchased and the cost of hosting the auction.  There are NO BUYER FEES, no hidden fees, no reserves, no gimmicks of any kind...  Any net profits are reinvested into buying the next set/collection to break and offer back to the collecting community.  \r\n\r\nThe starting bid price for each individual card is the cost we paid to obtain the card within the set + 5% which covers the time to scan and document each card, and the cost to host the auction.  These starting prices are almost always below comps.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a T206 collector, check out the auction now at [url]www.T206Cards.com[/url]!  \r\n\r\nBidding is open on all 800+ listings and they will end in alphabetical order by last name with the following schedule:\r\nA-F: Friday Dec 18th\r\nG-M: Saturday Dec 19th\r\nM-Z: Sunday Dec 20th\r\n\r\nI apologize if this post violates any rules of the forum.  Please advise if it does and we will move it to a more appropriate section.",

HA    I will even drive up from Colorado Springs and hand you cash for the cards in person, instead of dealing with USPS!!!!   Great amount of cards, and the raws you have are perfect for what I am doing!",
