      "post_content": "My boss' son has recently gotten into pre-war baseball, after I recommended The Glory of Their Times. She told me today he'd been googling T206 cards of Cobb, Wagner, and Tinker/Evers/Chance. \r\n\r\nI'd love to surprise her with one of these to give him for Christmas. So if someone has a real beater of one they'd sell me cheap, I'd appreciate it. Ungraded, creased, some paper loss, or a mark is fine. Just so you can see the player, read his name, and it has some sort of back left. Thanks!",
