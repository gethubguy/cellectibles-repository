      "post_content": "I\u2019ve been working hard on the t206 Hall of Famers recently. I\u2019d like to start filling the remaining holes. I\u2019m picky as all hell and there are some that I much rather have than others. Looking in the good to very good range, raw or graded. For the higher end guys, poor to good+ typically works for me. \n\nI have denoted which ones I want with off backs, and corresponding priority levels. Off backs are great but I can live without them. Thank you for looking and feel free to PM or email me at [url]wazywhoa@gmail.com[/url]. Also please see the ones I\u2019m looking to upgrade, and will always consider OM southern leaguers. Thank you!\n\nBender - trees (off back only, low priority)\nBrown port - (off back only, high priority)\nBrown - Cubs on shirt (off back preferred, medium priority)\nChance - batting (off back preferred, low priority)\nCobb - green (high priority)\nCobb - bat off (highest priority)\nJimmy Collins (off back only, low priority)\nCrawford - throwing (off back preferred, medium priority)\nDuffy (off back only, low priority)\nGriffith - batting (off back only, low) \nJennings - port (off back only, high priority)\nKeeler - batting (off back preferred, medium)\nLajoie - throwing (I have an A to upgrade)\nMarquard - hands at sides (off back only, low priority)\nMarquard - throwing (off back only, low priority)\nMatty - portrait (want to upgrade my 1.5)\nIron man (off back only, low priority)\nMcGraw - cap (off back only, low priority)\nMcgraw - glove (off back only, low priority)\nTinker - bat off \nWillis - all (would prefer off backs)\nYoung - port (high priority)\nYoung - no glove (medium priority) \n\nWould like to Upgrade: \nSpeaker - (SGC 2)\nChesbro - (SGC 2)\n\nOpen to:\nCad Cole\nEd Foster\nCharlie Fritz\nGeorge Manion*\nPat McCauley*\nGeorge Paige*\nRay Ryan\nShag Shaughnessy*(biggest priority) \nJuan Violat (Violat)\n\nAlways looking for off backs of commons as well.
