If you have any available, please let me know.  Would also be interested in 150 only subjects with sovereign 150 backs in any condition.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you have any PSA graded stuff for trade, would consider.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2km8UDQ][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50767343962_36f9d068fd_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2km8UF3][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50767344032_48262558f0_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
