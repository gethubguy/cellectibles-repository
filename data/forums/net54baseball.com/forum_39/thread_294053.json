Price includes registered mail with insurance.  \n\nWould consider trades for anything I need in t205 or t206 (PSA only 5 or better).  Still looking for a Green Cobb in PSA 4-5 too so this could be used in part (with cash) for one of those.  \n\nHappy to discuss with anyone who may be interested.  Would appreciate an email at [url]tbrambo@yahoo.com[/url] versus PM's here (I sometimes forget to check the PM's here). \n\nThanks!",
