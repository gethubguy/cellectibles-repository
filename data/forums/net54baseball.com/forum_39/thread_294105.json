      "post_content": "THRILLED TO SAY HE IS TRADED! ;)\r\n\r\nHave this Bender with trees EPDG available. Weird but fun card, kind of a pain to find and he\u2019s the toughest of the Benders.  Pop reports show six PSA 4\u2019s as the highest grade....while SGC has a single 4.5 as its highest graded along with two 4\u2019s including this one. Good get....\r\n\r\nAsking $625 via a no fee method of payment. Will consider trades for other HOFer EPDGs that could be upgrades for me. \r\n\r\nAvailable via PM. Thanks for looking!!!\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2knrALt][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50782112307_37a839a87a_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2knn8fA][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50781239298_9f15a9aed2_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
