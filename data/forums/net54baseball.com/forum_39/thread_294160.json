      "post_content": "You may buy one or more for any Reason\n\n#1 - Tubby Spencer - SC 150 Fact 649 BVG 3 - $72 or $70  ALMOST SOLD\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10210/spencer[/IMG]\n\nTubby is well centered and would be a nice addition for the \"649\" collector.\n\n#2 - Claude Rossman - SC 350 Fact 30 BVG 3.5 - SOLD\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10191/rossman[/IMG]\n\nClaude has a very nice image with only a vertical centering issue.  I do not see any thing at the top edge to suggest calling it a double name card.\n\n#3 - Sam Strang - P 350 Fact 25 BVG 4 - $82 or $79 ALMOST SOLD\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/53448/strang[/IMG]\n\nSam was disappointed in his grade.  i see no reason why his card didn't grade higher.\n\n# 4 - Charlie Rhodes - SC 350 Fact 30 BVG 4.5 - $98 or $95\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10189/rhodes[/IMG]\n\nCharlie has a fine image as well with a visible centering issue.\n\n# 5 - Admiral Schlei (Sweater) - Polar Bear BVG 5 - $165 or $160\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10194/schlei-portrait[/IMG]\n\nThe Admiral has a couple of typical Polar Bear tobacco stains in the top border.  The left upper corner has been touched (as they say) but not by me.  I strongly suspect that he is wearing the sweater because of the Polar Bear reverse.  It's cold up there.\n\n# 6 - Jack Quinn - P 350 Fact 25 BVG 5.5 - $175 or $170\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/13729/quinn[/IMG]\n\nA very slight diamond cut is the only deficiency (?) I see on Jack's card.\n\nIf you are keenly observant, you will notice two prices listed for each card.\nThe first price is for PP Goods and Services.  PP F&F is not offered for this sale.\nThe second price however excludes the PP tariff and may be utilized for payment by check, money order or wire.\n\nIf you are over 65, please do not purchase with the intent to crossover to a PSA slab.  You may not live long enough to see the card again.\n\nI know 99% of you buy the card and not the holder though.  Right????????:eek:\n\nI will cover the postage either way.\n\nRespond in the thread or by PM, and I will give out my address to send the loot if you want the lower price.\n\nIf you are hungover, no problem, we can work out the details later.  If you are sober, Happy New Year.",
