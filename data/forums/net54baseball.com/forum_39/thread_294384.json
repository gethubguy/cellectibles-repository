While condition of card isn\u2019t great, I like that it has a full ad back and the front image is still strong.\r\n\r\nAsking $SOLD shipped with a no fee method of payment if possible (PayPal friends, Venmo, CashApp), or check/MO with shipping on receipt.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kpwsPz][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50805694127_b42424a254_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kps2Se][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/50804829733_f43816952f_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
