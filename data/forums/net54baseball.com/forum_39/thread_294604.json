He is pretty funky. The neatest part about this card is the hand-written Nov 3 1909 date on the back that seems likely to have been the printer's notation of the day he made this card. Hand cut. \n\nMoriarity is missing color passes (rose and maybe peach), has a spill/splash of blue ink on the bottom right, and is hand cut.\n\nThe regular cards are not included, they are only for illustration.",
