I don\u2019t know how to download from my IPad the pictures, so any help or input would be well received.\n\nI have the following for sale-\n\nSOLD******Roger Bresnahan Batting-Sweet Caporal 350/30, probably a 1. Asking $65 for it\nLots of color, and nothing that would take away from the front overall.\n\nSOLD*******John McGraw Glove at Hip-Sweet Caporal 350-460/42, probably a 1. Asking $65 for it. One crease across the top third, doesn\u2019t take away from the card though.\n\nSOLD********\u201cIron Man\u201d Joe McGinnity-Sweet Caporal 350/30. EASILY A 2, no creases, color is really good. Asking $85 for it.\n\nNot making any money off these three cards, just want to use the cash to get other cards I am after or find. Feel free to email me anytime at \n\n[url]Jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url]\n\nI have no problem emailing pictures back, probably don\u2019t want to budge from asking price either, unless there is a compelling trade offer (portraits only). I will ship FedEx Ground as well. Payment method is PayPal F/F or Venmo. Nothing else.\n\nThank You,\nJames",
