      "post_content": "Hi All, I am looking for a Tinker Portrait that is raw. Do not want a graded one. I need something that is around a 1 or 2, and can have creases, as long as it does not take away from the integrity of the portrait. Not looking to spend over $175. If anyone has one, would love to purchase it!   Thanks, James",
