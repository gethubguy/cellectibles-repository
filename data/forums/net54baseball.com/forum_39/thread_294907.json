      "post_content": "Hi-I have an Eddie Collins SGC 1, with no creases or flaws.  It is miscut, with his name at the bottom, and at top. There is one very similar on eBay that is graded PSA 2 MC. I am not asking nearly that amount. Looking to negotiate. I would even trade straight up for a raw Collins portrait which would be considered lower grade.   I can\u2019t post the picture, because I still can\u2019t figure out with my iPad. I can email it though. Feel free to email with an offer, or trade. I am mainly after portraits, lower grades, that can be creased as long as the integrity of the portrait isn\u2019t affected. Also, will trade and take cash combo as well.    Thank You, James\r\n\r\n[url]jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url]",
