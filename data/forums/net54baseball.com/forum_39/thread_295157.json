      "post_content": "Hello, a few years ago, I started a project of trying to collect all the Sweet Cap factory 25 in all series.  I'm about half way through, and need help finding a few more.  Please, if you have time, look through your collections to see if you have any you want to get rid of!\r\n\r\nI've got cash, and I've got trade bait.\r\n\r\nI've completed the 460 series, so don't need any of those.\r\n\r\nPlease pm or email what you have and hopefully we can make a deal.\r\n\r\n[url]anthonyddavis@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nTony",
