Seems like a great group of people - I've learned a ton from this group just by poking around old threads.\r\n\r\nI am building a T206 set and am working on commons in a PSA 3-4. I am willing to look at cards other than commons, still missing quite a few mid tier and top tier HOFers. \r\n\r\nMy email is: [url]simonb@rlspencer.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!",
