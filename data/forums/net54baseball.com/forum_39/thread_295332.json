Piedmont or OM back is fine, looking for raw or 1.5 to 3 condition.  I need the following:\n\nManion\nMcCauley\nShag\n\nI also would be looking to trade up or buy ones which I already own, but aren't in good shape.  I am fine with poor back condition if the front is presentable.  Particularly, I am looking for Rockenfeld, Persons, Seitz, and Bay.\n\nThanks for the help. \n\nWill",
