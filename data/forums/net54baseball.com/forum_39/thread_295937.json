I'd be your buyer for any 1's or 2's you upgrade.\r\n\r\nSecondarily; I thought you would like to know that you have officially helped me kick off my 3rd run at the set with this purchase.\r\nI've entered a set on the PSA Registry with the Ritchey being the first card.\r\nRanked at #172, my run of purchases over the weekend should help me move a few ticks.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated.\r\nRayB",
