I won't have it in hand until tomorrow, so I'll probably wait until I go pick it up from the Post Office before accepting the best offer.  Obviously if someone takes it at list price, that supersedes all negotiation.  Also, if you'd like better scans, let me know and I'll send them on Saturday.\r\n\r\n$625 or best offer",
