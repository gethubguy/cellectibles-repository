(before you ask, these are forged signatures that I did for the display.  I won't reveal my secret, because they're pretty darn convincing). \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.billykoehler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_7113-1-scaled.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMy budget really restricts me to fair market value for a PSA/SGC 1.5-2.0.  If you have any leads, please PM me... or email me at [url]williammkoehler@gmail.com[/url] \r\n\r\nThanks so much, and have a great weekend!\r\nBilly Koehler",
