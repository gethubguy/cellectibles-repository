      "post_content": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nFinished the long road to 520 on the T206 set in late 2020.  Was a ton of fun, with lots of great board members helping out.\r\n\r\nFinally got a PSA submission back with the other 5 remaining cards, after 7 months away on a 20-day submission...  I think a lot of us are in the same boat here.   \r\nThat leaves my only non-PSA graded card in the 520 as this particular Bender.\r\n\r\nI am in need of one PSA-graded copy, a Bender w/ Trees in PSA 4.0 - 6.0.  \r\nA copy in a '5' would be absolutely ideal, but any help at all is appreciated.\r\n\r\nHave PP Gift funds at the ready.  If a trade or part-exchange is preferred I do have a centered SGC 4 Bender w/ Trees.\r\nAlso have some other nice stuff back -- PSA 4 George Mullin (throwing) and Wildfire Schulte (Front View), both are tough, and an SGC 4 Bud Sharpe as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n|",
