      "post_content": "A large find new to the hobby in 2008 was garnered by Beckett for grading.\r\nAndy Broome may have touched these cards in 2008.\r\nCert #s all began with 544xxxx.\r\nAll cards were sold initially through REA.  If this provenance appeals to you, I have other cards from this find including Cobb Bat On\r\n\r\nFor sale are ten cards from the find all graded 4.5 and all with Sweet Cap NY backs (both 150 and 350).  Therefore they are a uniform set of cards for a midrange upgrader.  Sold individually or in bunches.  Add $3.00/card for regular PP.  No FF for this sale.  Check or MO okay.  I'll cover shipping for multiple card orders, otherwise add $5.00 as well.  Have at it.  Representatives are waiting for your PMs.\r\n\r\nRed Ames Portrait  $OLD   \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10016/ames-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\nShad Barry   $OLD\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10018/barry-s[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLena (The Mud Man) Blackburne   $OLD  \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10050/blackburne[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBill Dineen    $OLD\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10095/dineen[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBill Donovan Throwing   $OLD  \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10096/donovan-pitching[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRed Dooin    $OLD  \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10083/dooin[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPatsy Dougherty   $OLD   \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10085/dougherty-portrait[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTed Easterly   $OLD\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10088/easterly[/IMG]\r\n\r\nCharlie Hemphill   $OLD.  \r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10111/hemphill[/IMG]\r\n\r\nJames Jackson   $OLD\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-bvg/10120/jackson[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the current market prices are good for a month from the original listing or until March 18.\r\nThey may be raised then.
