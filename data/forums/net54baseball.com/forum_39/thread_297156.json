I don\u2019t know much about t206 cards but am searching for examples of Brown, Tinker, Evers, and Chance in PSA/SGC 2.5-4.  I\u2019m looking for a clean image of the front and I don\u2019t care too much about the back type.  Let me know what you have.  Thanks!\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
