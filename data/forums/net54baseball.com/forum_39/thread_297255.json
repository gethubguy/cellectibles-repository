      "post_content": "*sold* Card has no creases and still has factory style gloss.  Unfortunately, when I sent it in to be slabbed it it came back trimmed. The card looks like an 8+ with great centering.  I was originally asking $1200, but now open to offers.  DM me if you have any questions. \n\n[url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppmwmcb4lftki12/T206%20Johnson%20Front.jpg?dl=0[/url]\n\n[url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/byelb1z3ay0redg/t206%20Johnson%20Back.jpg?dl=0[/url]",
