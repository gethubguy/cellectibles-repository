I try to stay in the 4 to 5 range on grades, but I certainly add esthetic lower grades when possible. I\u2019m not looking to low ball and flip, and I can provide several Net54 references to attest to my sincerity. I\u2019m looking for anything not piedmont, SC or Sovereign (unless it\u2019s a SC \u2018no print\u2019 or Sovereign 460 \u2018super print\u2019, etc.). I enjoy adding really tough backs (Drum, Uzit, BL, CB, etc), but I also appreciate the 150/350 OMs and collect the Hindu subset. PMs are fine, but I prefer email to [url]sonnytutor@gmail.com[/url]. Thank you for your consideration. \r\nSonny",
