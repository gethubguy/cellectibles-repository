      "post_content": "Hi everyone.  New member here.  I'm relatively new to T206.  My son and I typically focus on post-war cards but became entranced with T206 after a neighbor sold us a Tinker, Evers, and Chance with Polar Bear backs.  That purchase led to a lot of research and we have become obsessed with the set and have been picking up cards here and there.  We are mostly picking up commons and are working toward building the HOF portrait set.  \r\n\r\nWe have a modest start on the HOF portraits but am missing most of the big names.  We are hoping that there may be a few of these lying around that we could pick up.  PSA 1-2 or raw are preferred but we are open to anything - please let me know if you are willing to part with any of the following HOF portraits (in order of preference):\r\n\r\nLajoie\r\nJohnson\r\nYoung\r\nTinker\r\nEvers\r\nChance\r\n\r\nCommon backs are fine (and preferred due to cost considerations).\r\n\r\nThanks for any and all help! \r\n\r\nTake care,\r\nTom",
