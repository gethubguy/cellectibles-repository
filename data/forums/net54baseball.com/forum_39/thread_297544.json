With the extensive grading delays, I will no longer have the patience to wait.\r\nSo, despite this card being perhaps the nicest one I own, I'm parting with it.\r\n\r\nEdited to add its been TRADED. Trade for a PSA graded T206 of equal, lesser or greater value with cash or additional cards making up the difference.\r\nRayB",
