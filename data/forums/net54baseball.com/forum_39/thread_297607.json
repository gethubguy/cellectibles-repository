That said, I collect vintage signed cards and am looking for a few signed T206 cards to add to my collection.  I'm not 100% sure what I'm looking for just yet, but I'll know it when I see it.\r\n\r\nIf you have any signed T206's that you would be willing to part with, please email me at [url]martyesullivan@yahoo.com[/url]\r\n\r\nMy best,\r\nMarty S.",
