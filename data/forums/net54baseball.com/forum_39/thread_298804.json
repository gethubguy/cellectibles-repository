I'm early in my T206 quest and it seems like a goal I can reach and get a sense of accomplishment early on.  :)\n\nI currently have 5 of the 11.  I would like to purchase any of the others in raw, low-grade condition.  Please feel free to send images and asking prices via PM or email.  I'm fine with PWE shipping for single cards.\n\nNeeded:\n\nBrain\nBurchell\nClancy\nFlanagan\nMalarkey\nTaylor\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTommy",
