      "post_content": "Widely regarded as the most obscure subjects of the three Johnny Evers T206 poses. \r\nOnly been bested by a mere 7 Piedmont examples listed on the PSA \"Pop\" chart, with only 2 other Piedmont specimens reflecting the PSA 6 assessment.\r\n\r\nNear-perfect horizontal centering, with the \"side-to-side\" positioning revealing a significant partiality towards the left edge (most likely preventing a \"NM/7\" assessment). Snow-like borders, relatively clean surfaces, four uniform right-angled corners and a super bold Piedmont Cigarettes verso\r\n\r\nThe last PSA 6 to sell was via PWCC last Dec for $2,750\r\n\r\nWill deliver priority ship for SOLD via PP F&F \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nWayne",
