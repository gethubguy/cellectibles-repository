Per the chart below (using PSA pops), the below cards have generally similar pops to the Elite 11.  \n\nIt's taken about 2 years to assemble this nearly complete binder page.  I see A LOT of raw cards and these are not easy to find.\n\nIf all that means nothing to you, then selling some nice raw commons :)\n\nThe pictures are as a binder page, so backs are flipped.  E.g., Conroy is the backstamp.  Free shipping.  Prices for FF.\n\nDonovans: Left SOLD; Middle (recolored) $50; Right SOLD\nBergen batting SOLD\nLeach portrait SOLD\nMcQuillan fielding: Left SOLD; Right $50\nKonetchy glove up: BOTH SOLD\nConroy fielding: $85 (00209 backstamp)\nPastorius: $125\nMcIntyre: SOLD\nCovaleski: Left (ugly back) $50; Right (clean back) $85",
