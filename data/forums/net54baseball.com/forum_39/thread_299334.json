      "post_content": "I would like to spend $200 to acquire some low grade commons.  I'm hoping to spend about $20 or less each.  I do have a couple of requirements though:\n\n1. Intact cards are preferred.  No missing pieces.  :)\n2. Not trimmed.\n3. Not graded (of course)\n\nOther than that I'm open to whatever backs, missing paper on backs, creases, etc.\n\nI would prefer to buy in one single lot if possible. I'm still fairly new in my T206 journey so my wantlist includes most cards.  \n\nPlease send me some pictures and asking prices to [url]tommy.patrick at gmail dot com[/url].\n\nThanks so much!",
