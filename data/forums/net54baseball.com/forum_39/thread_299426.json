The (unobtrusive, in my opinion) corner crease at the bottom right is the only thing I can see that held this back from the higher grade it would otherwise merit. \n\n$500 shipped via tracked USPS First Class, net to me. Multiple payment methods accepted. \n\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/UmAFwUO.png[/IMG]",
