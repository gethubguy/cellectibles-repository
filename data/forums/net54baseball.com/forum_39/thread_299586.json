      "post_content": "Well it's been a fun ride.  I started consolidating my entire card collection in July 2018. Working from the bottom, \"keeping my favorites\",  re-evaluating my favorites at several steps along the way.  I've been at it steadily almost 3 years now.  Pre-war thru modern, baseball, football, basketball, hockey.   Very very very few found the trash can.  Many many many went for a few cents a piece.  It was great re-discovering my cards and I believe I truly enjoyed sending them to new homes as much as I enjoyed collecting them in the first place\r\n\r\nI knew all along my raw 520 set in a binder would be the last of any value to be consolidated.  Fall of 2020 I had met my goal of fitting my \"surviving\" cards into various vintage boxes, drawers, and cabinets around my home.   The last major effort - selling my fairly extensive Barry Larkin collection - was starting to slow to a crawl, and I was down to relisting a few stragglers from the 90's over and over on eBay.\r\n\r\nIn October Morrie Mullins posted a WTB on the BST  for a PB Demmitt and O'Hara. Those were the last two cards I acquired for my 520 so it seemed fitting that they were the first two to go.  I decided it was time.  I reached out to Morrie and had a short pleasant PM conversation over 2 or 3 days.   I learned the meaning of the word magnanimous, and at the end sent my Demmitt and O'Hara onto Morrie to keep for a while.  \r\n\r\nIt's been a steady five months..... My monster number is now 184 and I have 6 remaining of those I identified to sell.   I love these little cards and am happy that most of my former 520 now resides in net54 collections.   As I described in most of my eBay listings,  I enjoyed these in my collection for a few years, and am passing them on for someone else to do the same..\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the remaining 6.  \r\n\r\nPriced individually.  Paypal preferred.  add $3 shipping for any number of cards.\r\n\r\n[STRIKE]$70Ames (Hands above Head)[/STRIKE]\r\n$35Camnitz (Hands above Head)\r\n[STRIKE]$35Hemphill[/STRIKE]SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]$70Lattimore[/STRIKE]SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]$25Milligan[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n$35Smith F.
