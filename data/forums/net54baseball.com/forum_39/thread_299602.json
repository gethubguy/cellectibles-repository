If the prices seem too high, wait a week or two.  If they still seem too high, wait a month or two.  In the unlikely event that they still seem too high, wait a year.\r\n\r\nBut why, ten years from now you will patting yourself on the back for taking advantage of these remarkable slabs (with the cards included), that will seem like bargains in retrospect.\r\n\r\n1.

Yes, your eye\u2019s do not deceive you.  90% off April 1st only on all cards except the Overall Portrait\n\nTo calculate 90% off either\n\n1.  Remove the last zero from the listed price or,\n\n2.  Move the decimal point one column to the left.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see a decimal point, find one and put it in front of the zero that you didn\u2019t remove.\n\nIf this is too complicated, move on to another thread.\n\nTwo members have expressed interest in the Overall Card.  The reduced price is $108 for this card.  I am asking both members to place a bid greater than $108.  High bid wins, but the winner will pay only one dollar more than the losing bid.\nGood luck to both of you.",
