Cobb will ship via USPS Registered (my insurance requires this) so it will take a little longer, but be very safe.\r\n\r\nCobb has a litte crack on the back of the holder that does not affect the card\r\n\r\nThere are no creases on either of these.  They are basically VGEX in terms of Printer's Scrap, though of course they will always grade Auth.\r\n\r\nCobb $3095 paypal Goods or $3000 ppff/check SOLD\r\nMathewson $2200 ------> $1850 SOLD",

      "post_content": "Hey sorry for the slow reply.  This article does a pretty good job of answering, but I'll give an answer for these cards specifically also:\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.thatt206life.com/2018/03/04/t206-printers-scrap-101/[/url]\r\n\r\nThe last one in that article applies to the Cobb here.  The borders on the top flare out pretty far to the left and right, and if you imagine how large all four borders would have had to be before trimming, it becomes pretty hard to imagine this card being anything other than cut from a sheet by hand.\r\n\r\nThat last category is more art than science, and pretty tough to prove one way or another.  I've looked at hundreds of thousands of t206 cards and scans and these things kind of pop out at me now.\r\n\r\nThe Mathewson has huge borders, so it's clearly not trimmed, but all edges are uneven.  It was mostly like cut from a sheet by hand, but it's possible it was factory-cut this way.  The top and bottom cuts kind of match up but the left edge doesn't line up real well with the right.",
