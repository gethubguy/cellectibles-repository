This one is nice!\n\nIf interested please drop me an email to discuss. No PM's please! Commitment to purchase outweighs any ongoing negotiations. \n\nIf a deal is struck and PP is used please add 3%. If I know you and we've done business before a personal check is fine. If not it would need to be certified.\n\nThanks all, Tony\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/t206cobbgreenfrontnoadj.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/threetwocount/threetwocount/t206cobbgreenbacknoadj.jpg[/IMG]",
