I have to collect sales tax from WA state buyers.  Price assumes a no-fee payment method, but I am fine with PP Goods.  Just add 3%.\r\n\r\nPretty incredible card for the grade in my opinion.  Just a few wrinkles and corner wear.\r\n\r\nNot exactly sure how to price this one.  A couple 1.5s with tough backs have sold lately.  A Sov150 PSA 1.5 went for $4550.  That was a nice card, but eye appeal not quite at the level of this one.  And a PSA 1.5 EPDG went for $3035.  The back of that one had some issues.  Obviously Hindu is quite a step up from either of those backs.  I think about double the Sov150 is about right, but feel free to send me offers.  As always \"SOLD\" or \"I'll take it\" takes precedence over any outstanding offers.\r\n\r\nThis scan looks a lot bigger if you open it in Paint so feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like me to send it to you.\r\n\r\n$8900 obo",
