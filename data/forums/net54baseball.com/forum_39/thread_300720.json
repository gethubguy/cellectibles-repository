I\u2019ll be posting a number of Baltimore cards over the coming days. Some raw some graded all different backs. If these sell I\u2019ll continue to post more. \n\nPrices are net to me and include shipping. PayPal FF preferred (add 3% for goods)\nAny questions just ask. Any issues let me know and we\u2019ll take care of it. \nI can send better pictures if needed.\n\n4 raw cards to start: \nJimmy Jackson Piedmont - SOLD\nPhil Poland Piedmont - SOLD\nJack Dunn Sweet Caporal 350/30 - SOLD\nJimmy Slagle Sovereign - SOLD - difficult combo - creases and measures slightly short\n\nThanks for looking",
