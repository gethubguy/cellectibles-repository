Surface resembles what a lot of vintage 6s look like, with T206 dull \"gloss\" full & prominent.\r\n\r\nSold Paypal FF, (G&S w/fees), Venmo, Zelle. Earliest timestamps on PMs or this thread of \"Sold\" take precedence.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/SKhoJybh.jpg?1[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/uXOJK6Zh.jpg?1[/IMG]",
