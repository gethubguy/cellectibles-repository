      "post_content": "For sale is a beautiful oak storage box for T206's. Box measures 9\"X13\"X4\". The bottom has green felt so box can be displayed anywhere without leaving scatches. Inside of box also has green felt on the bottom as well as 4 divider panels creating 5 rows of card storage. Outside of box has brass hinges and is lockable with key. A really nice way to store and display your T206 collection. $100 net to me plus $20 for shipping.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\n[url=https://postimages.org/][img]https://i.postimg.cc/hjSjmhBh/top.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://postimages.org/][img]https://i.postimg.cc/MTdGmx65/open.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://postimages.org/][img]https://i.postimg.cc/4NK3Vrrv/front.jpg[/img][/url]",

      "post_content": "The dividers can be removed so technically you could store slabs horizonally in the box but only a very limited number would fit. The box is designed with the divider panels to hold raw tobacco cards in tobacco card size plastic sleeves. I've added a picture to show how the sleeves fit in the rows, i will include the sleeves (30) with the box. Hope this answers your question.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[url=https://postimages.org/][img]https://i.postimg.cc/LXZQFk5Z/slabs.jpg[/img][/url]",
