      "post_content": "I have this gorgeous Piedmont 350, PSA 3.5 Tris Speaker. Dead centered, full borders, deep blue background with fantastic registration and no creases or wrinkles. I\u2019m looking to deal it for a similar, high quality, Speaker graded by SGC. The rest of my T206\u2019s are in SGC slabs and, well, I\u2019m one of those sticklers. I\u2019m not looking to sell and I\u2019m not looking to deal it for anything else. I bought this card from a fellow Net54er who graded the card himself.
