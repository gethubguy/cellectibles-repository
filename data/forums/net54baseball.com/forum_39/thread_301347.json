      "post_content": "Really cool Rube Marquard miscut.  These types of front/back miscuts are extremely rare, and even more so on a Sweet Caporal. \r\n\r\nThe top of the previous card on the sheet during production can be seen on the front, and the back is equally off center.  Typically miscuts only show the nameplate.   \r\n\r\nPSA graded 2 (MC)\r\n\r\nLooking for SOLD obo, net to me.  I will pick up shipping.  \r\n\r\n\"I'll take it\" takes precedence over ongoing negotiations.",
