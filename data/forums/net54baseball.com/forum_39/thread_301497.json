      "post_content": "**ALL CARDS SOLD**\n\nThe Cobb has a couple small spots of paper loss on the front with some slight creasing and well rounded corners but colors are nice and the face and lettering look sharp.  \n\nThe Speaker has slight creasing but the background and details all look great.\n\nThe Johnson has plenty of wear and tear to it but has nice appeal to it for a battered up \"1\"\n\n\nAsking:\n\nCobb - $2900\nSpeaker $1100\nJohnson $600\n\nPrices include shipping and insurance.  DM me for questions.\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/cobbfront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/cobbback.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/speakerfront.JPG[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/speakerback.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/johnsonfront.JPG[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.mcsheaphotography.com/johnsonback.JPG[/IMG]",
