      "post_content": "Got a Kling raw I will trade for a Abbaticchio Blue Sleeves. Looking for something that would be a grade 1 or 2. Will give you a choice of two very nice Klings to choose from for a trade. Will not trade for anything that has markings, stamps, or creases that degrade the integrity of the card/picture.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have two Ames portraits. One is definitely nicer than the other, but both are nice portraits. Looking to trade one for his other two cards, or a fair trade for one with equal integrity to the portrait. \r\n\r\nFeel free to PM me, or email me at [url]jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url]",
