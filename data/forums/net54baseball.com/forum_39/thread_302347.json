Obviously has its issues that account for the grade, but I think this presents better than most 1s - great registration, great color, and the creases thankfully spared the face. \r\n\r\n$3700 shipped, net to me. Multiple payment methods accepted, and plenty of references available. \r\n\r\nWould prefer cash sale but am open to trades/partial trades for top tier T206 HoFers like Cy, WaJo, Matty, or other Cobbs. \r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/8MBV1bZ.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/sWxzzQl.png[/IMG]",
