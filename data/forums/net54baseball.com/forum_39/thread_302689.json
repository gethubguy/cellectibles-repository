It assumes PayPal FF to me, add 3% for goods.\n\nThe Elite 11 cards are very hard to price.  Several of them in PSA 3 grades sold last summer for between $1,900 and $2,500.  \n\nFirst I'll take it supersedes all on-going negotiations.  \n\nP.S - The brown mark on the case below his name is a tiny piece of string that somehow made it's way onto the scanner and is NOT a mark on the holder.  I can email a picture of the card showing no brown string if need be, just let me know.\n\nPlease email me at [url]frankbev29@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions.",
