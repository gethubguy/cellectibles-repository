The photo is close to the likeness of the t206 card, both hands in the hair and right knee kicked high, but I've been told by guys that know alot more about photos than I do, that it is not THE photo the card is based on. Still a cool piece of baseball history and a great image of one of baseballs most animated fellas. Selling as a pair only. $750 shipped, US.  REDUCED  $675",
