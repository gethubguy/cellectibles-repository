If graded my guess would be a 2 or 3, as there is the tiniest of wrinkles at the top of the front only.\r\n\r\nAsking $185 delivered. \r\n\r\nPlease PM if interested.\r\n\r\nI am doing a serious Spring cleaning and will be posting a bunch of items all over the BST in various categories from autographs to type 1 photos to various cards etc. Keep an eye out because I intend to price these items as well as I can for quick sale. This is not to say I wish to give them away, as they have been in my collection for a long time and can just as easily remain there. But if I can pass them along to others who can appreciate them more, and do so at a good price for the buyer, I am more than happy to do so.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/yy203/collectiblesgains/(edited)_img20210531_09060731.jpg?width=960&height=720&fit=bounds[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/yy203/collectiblesgains/(edited)_img20210531_09054199.jpg?width=960&height=720&fit=bounds[/IMG][/URL]",
