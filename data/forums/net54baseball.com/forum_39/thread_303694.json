The actual Doyle error only occurs on Pied350s. While this printers mark does show up on other backs, I think it\u2019s cool to imagine this P350 being printed with the same plate as the Doyle error (with just 99% of the error removed).\r\n\r\nSee thread here: [URL=\"https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=87066&highlight=slow+joe+doyle\"]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=87066&highlight=slow+joe+doyle[/URL]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/9152/files/B27B162B-0F2C-4DC0-9CAC-2C8E1A7A1F78_600x600.png?v=1623932064[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/9152/files/457E72DC-72FA-44AA-BD52-AEE875AFC388_1024x1024.png?v=1623932106[/IMG]",
