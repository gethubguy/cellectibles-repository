PM or email (tbrambo@yahoo.com) if you have any of these you're looking to sell.  \r\n\r\nAlso happy to do a trade of mine (grade shown to the right of the need) plus cash to balance for your PSA 4 or better.  \r\n\r\nNot interested in selling cards from the below list, either.  Just want to upgrade my set.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTroy Rambo",
