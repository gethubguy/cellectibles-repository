      "post_content": "Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a doubly graded card.\nSeveral years ago I took the risk and submitted my 20 GAI slabs for\ncrossover after cracking them out of their GAI tombs.\nAll 20 received numerical numerical grades from SGC.  Only five of the twenty remain in my possession.\n\nOverall the SGC grades were slightly lower, but these five cards received 24.5 GAI grade points as a group and also received 24.5 SGC grade points.\n\nThe last five are offered for sale.  As an added incentive, if you are a serious buyer and guess correctly the GAI grade after we have agreed on a price, you will get 10% off the agreed on price.  Don't guess until you have committed to buy the card.\n\nCamnitz Hands over Head - $180\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10607/camnitz-hands-over-head[/IMG]\n\nJoe Dunn Brooklyn - $OLD\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10591/dunn-joe[/IMG]\n\nFromme Pitching - $140\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10592/fromme-pitching[/IMG]\n\nOakes - $250\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10598/oakes[/IMG]\n\nWright - $OLD\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10604/wright[/IMG]\n\nAsking prices are based on the SGC grades and not the original GAI grades.\n\nGood luck.;)",
