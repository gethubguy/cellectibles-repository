Looking for something with equal value and nice eye appeal. Only looking to trade for now. Thanks in advance.\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1127&pictureid=22710[/IMG][IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1128&pictureid=22712[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1127&pictureid=27752[/IMG][IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1128&pictureid=27753[/IMG]",
