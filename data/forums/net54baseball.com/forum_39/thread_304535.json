No creases on this guy and the image and color are great. \r\n\r\nAsking $SOLD for him.  Available via PM to discuss or you can email me at [url]thromdog@hotmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2m97wkZ][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51287632623_d65d5a1394_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2m96LUZ][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51287486521_411cc26fb7_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
