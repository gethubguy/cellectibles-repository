This one is graded SGC 5.5 and is nearly identical to the one that just sold on eBay: [url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/144100014380[/url]\r\n\r\nI am asking SOLD for the red and [STRIKE]$7950[/STRIKE] SOLD for the green, net to me including the shipping.\r\n\r\nBecause I am new on this forum I am happy to accommodate any payment details that we are both comfortable with.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\nSteve",
