      "post_content": "I listed it in the ebay section but guess I should list it here too.  First sold in 2008 in REA.  Little line next to his hands is not a crease or wrinkle.  I have not tried to cross it to PSA or SGC, nor did the original owner.  I see no reason it wouldn't grade but I think standards are a little tougher now than when this was graded.  $8500 dlvd. no fees.  Not looking to trade.  A PSA 4 with much more corner wear sold in May in PWCC for over 10K for reference.\r\n\r\nREA link.\r\n[url]https://robertedwardauctions.com/auction/2008/spring/600/1909-1911-t206-cobb-bat-shoulder-bvg[/url]",
