I tried it using both methods and neither worked.  It's a little bizarre, because I have never had an issue uploading photos and am using the same method I always have.",

      "post_content": "Really nice card!! And it's a Factory 25. I'm just bumping your post to the top and commenting on the picture upload issues you were having. I never had any problems and didn't change anything. Then one day my photos stopped showing up in the preview section. But others would see my pictures that I posted, just not me. Kind of odd and never figured out the problem. I had a similar issue when I was running my own web servers. I couldn't view the websites from my browser on the web server but had no problem viewing them from a different computer visiting my web server. I remember fixing the issue by changing a setting on my web servers. But still don't know the fix for my current issue with seeing my pictures. I tried smaller graphics, which was never a problem in the past, and I even tried a different browser. Switching from Internet Explorer to Google Chrome. When I look at my post from my phone, the pictures are viewable. Just not from my computer. I'll have to see what happens if I remove the www from the link.",
