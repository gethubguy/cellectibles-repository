      "post_content": "I\u2019m presently trying to swap out my Piedmont and Sweet Cap backs for Sovereign or better off backs. Below is a list of the cards I still need. In most cases I can include a P or SC version of the card in any deal or purchase outright. My set is graded so preference for graded but raw good as well. PSA/SGC only. \r\n\r\nSweet spot is 2.5 to 4.5 but anything with nice eye appeal works. I personally don\u2019t do Authentics or really off condition cards. \r\n\r\nWould sincerely appreciate any help you might be able to provide me towards my goal. \r\n\r\nPM, email or posts in this thread all work. \r\n\r\nThanks.
