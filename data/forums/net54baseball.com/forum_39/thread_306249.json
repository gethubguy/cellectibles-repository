Their mom is undergoing chemo, I\u2019ve shared some of the pics of my collection with the dad and he says his kids are crazy for my cards. Boys are 10 and 12, both play ball, both collect cards.\r\n\r\nTo make this cool, another co-worker [who happens to be my bff] asked me to check out his \u201cjunk wax\u201d as he\u2019s looking to declutter his house. I told him of my idea w the tobacco cards and he jumped in and will be gifting his 80s and 90s collection to these two boys. \r\n\r\nSo\u2026let me know if you guys have two starter cards - like $30 - !\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nKevin",
