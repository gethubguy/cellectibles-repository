      "post_content": "Hi all - \nI am starting the process of breaking up a t206 set.  Most of these cards are commons or minor HOF and they mostly all have great visual appeal.  Most, if not all, are full sized, and many are oversized as well, as I have been very conscientious about adding cards to this set that I felt were unequivocally original. \nPricing = not cheap, but still reasonable in most cases, especially considering the fact that so many T206 are setting records daily, and there is no Buyer's Premium.  I have picked the Jimmy Sheckard (no glove) and Spike Shannon cards as examples:  \n\nShannon PSA 5 w/Sweet Cap 350 30/24 $325\nSheckard PSA 3 w/Sweet Cap 150 Fac. 649 with Overstrike $175\n\nA total of around 350 cards are available.  I'm hoping to find other collectors that want and need these cards for their sets, and NOT that guy that is going to ask me about 80 cards to just find that one that I have undervalued so that he can make $50 on his flip.  If that part describes you then please ignore this post.\n\nLet me know what you need!\ncrispycards\nChris P\n[url]chrisportersa@gmail.com[/url]",
