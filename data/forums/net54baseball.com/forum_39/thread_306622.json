      "post_content": "Hey guys\r\n\r\nFirst timer for T206 / vintage card collecting in general-Found my childhood set of junk wax and reminded myself of how awesome baseball cards are. I\u2019m captivated by the great artwork and coloring of the T206 and the idea of owning something with more stories than I can think of excites me. Wanting to dive into a few raw or low graded commons- Anyone have any they are looking to sell or have advice to a young collector? Been researching the series, watching ebay etc to get a feel for what to look for, but looking for a place to start. \r\n\r\nThanks!",

Shout out to Eliot and 53ToppsCollector for helping me get my first couple of cards. Can\u2019t wait to share them with my boys when they are older! \r\n\r\nStill interested in getting a couple more raw or low grade commons, or any advice you have had collecting T206. I know there is a tremendous wealth of knowledge and experience in this group!",

Up to a mighty 6 total! It\u2019s fun thinking about the long term growth though of my collection and passing it down to my sons one day.\r\n\r\nI still have a modest $38 left in my budget for the year. Anyone have any commons they are looking to sell? Let me know, thanks!",
