As you can imagine, the off-backs are harder to locate.\n\n\nI'd love to find graded versions of these guys in lower grades (\"A\" through 4), so if you have examples you're looking to sell please send them along.\n\n\n\nFeel free to email me at [url]helfrich91@yahoo.com[/url] or shoot me a PM.\n\n\nIt's great to have the Net54 community in your corner for a project like this!\n\n\nBest,\nTodd Helfrich",
