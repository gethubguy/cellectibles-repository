I'm looking for reasonable offers on any or all but would prefer to sell as a lot.  \r\n\r\nI will plan to send up to two cards via pwe.  Three or more will ship via first class bubble mailer.  If the entire lot sells as one I will ship in a flat rate small priority box.  Shipping will be included in any agreed upon price.  The cards are viewable via the link below.   Please let me know if you have any questions. \r\n\r\n[url]http://imgur.com/a/SZGewrg[/url]\r\n\r\nPayment by PayPal f&f preferred.  Thanks.",
