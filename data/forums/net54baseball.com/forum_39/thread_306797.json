      "post_content": "Looking to buy a Harry Howell Portrait in PSA 6, 6.5 or 7 grade with no qualifiers.  Any back is fine.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe pop report says there are 50 of these out there which fit this criteria.  Likely a needle in a haystack ask (like my green Cobb ask that took 18 months) but if you have one feel free to PM or email [url]tbrambo@yahoo.com[/url].\r\n\r\nThanks!!",
