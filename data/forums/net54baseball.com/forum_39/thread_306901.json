Should have listened to all of the people that told me to buy the Cobbs first. \r\n\r\nLooking to cross a Cobb off the list in the near future. \r\n\r\nPrefer PSA. Ideal grade is a fair 3 but willing to go a grade in either direction depending on the card/eye appeal. \r\n\r\nI respond quick to emails: [url]simonb@rlspencer.com[/url]\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated. Thank you ahead of time!",
