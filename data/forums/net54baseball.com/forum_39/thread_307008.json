But mine are nearly all non Piedmont/Sweet Caporals. The few that you do have, I already have those in graded form already. Maybe if you get others in the future, I might have something that would work in a trade.",

I should be able to find raw copies of those cards without much issue. Still hoping to trade for raw versions of the off backs of what remains.",
