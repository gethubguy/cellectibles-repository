Regular paypal, buyer pays the fee.\n\n\nFor my records, the following have been SOLD on this thread:\n\nAmes, hands over head, PSA 3;\nChase throwing, dark cap, PSA 2.5;\nHarry Davis [Davis front], PSA 3;\nDowney batting, PSA 3;\nLarry Doyle with bat, PSA 3;\nLatham, PSA 3;\nMagee batting, PSA 3;\nMeyers portrait, PSA 3;\nOverall, hands at waist, PSA 3;\nSchlei batting, PSA 3;\nSeymour, portrait, PSA 3 [In my opinion, over-graded, and discounted];\nStahl, glove shows, PSA 3;",
