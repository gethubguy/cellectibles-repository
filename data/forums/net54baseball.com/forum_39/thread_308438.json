      "post_content": "I have hundreds of t206 for sale.  I have a bunch of graded and ungraded in various conditions.  most the ungraded are in the PR to VG range.  Could work with you on putting together a great starter lot.  I used to be a dealer who specialized in just T206 but I have been selling off all of my inventory to fund my new app [url]www.sportscardscanner.com[/url].  Send me a PM and let me know what sort of budget you are working with and we can start to put together a lot for you.  I have plenty of references on this site and others, am the owner of t206cards.com, and my ebay store is t206cards-com.  \r\n\r\nFred",
