      "post_content": "Hi all, I am selling a 175 card raw lot. I would only consider selling the entire lot to one buyer. A few key details:\r\n  \r\n- 175 total cards (all raw)\r\n- 8 HOF cards \r\n- 5 cards are duplicated (all commons) \r\n- A mix of Piedmont, Sweet Cap, Polar Bear and 1 EPDG (a HOF card - Bresnahan)\r\n- While raw, the condition of the cards are quite nice. None of the cards are terrible. \r\n- 7 of 8 HOF cards are very nice, 1 has a small crease\r\n- I have scans of all the cards and an excel checklist I can share.\r\n\r\nSerious inquiries please email [url]ariskarras13@gmail.com[/url]",
