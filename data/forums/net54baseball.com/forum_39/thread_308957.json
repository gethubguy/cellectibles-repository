      "post_content": "I was looking to trade my Cobb for an E92 Wagner, which is no longer available for trade.  I'm not really looking to move it.\r\n\r\nI got three replies regarding it's value:\r\n\r\n1. [First evaluation was $3.5K] \"$4k might be a better guess since your card presents very well\u2026.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"I think overall it presents well, just need the right buyer who doesn\u2019t mind the stamp. \r\n[Messenger 2 compared this Cobb to another at an attractive price, but I don't want to specify, not to identify him or give away his information].\r\n\r\n3. \"I'd say yours is at least 4000, maybe 4500 to the right buyer.\"\r\n\r\nI think those are all good estimates.  ButI do collect back-stamps myself, and I value it more than that.\r\nThe pointing finger is my favorite stamp, and to me the stamp adds to, not detracts from the value.  I fully realize that many collectors don't feel the same way.  So that's why I'm keeping it.\r\n\r\nI did get a couple of other pm's from people interested in buying/trading for  it.  I won't rule out selling it or trading it for a bigger/more desirable card.  But I likely over-value it.  As [3] above says, it would have to be to the right buyer.\r\n\r\nThanks for the interest and the input.",
