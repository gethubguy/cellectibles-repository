Use the attached trade bait toward t206 Cobb\u2019s or Young portrait. \n\nAttached are \n(1) Green Cobb SGC 1 \n(2) Mathewson portraits, Both SGC 1.5\n(2) Piedmont 350 Elite 11 - (Jones / Schaefer)\nEPDG 2.5 Jennings Two Hands. \n\n2. Upgrade either of my Matty portraits to a higher grade portrait. I have (2) 1.5s. Maybe combine into a SUPER MATTY.",
