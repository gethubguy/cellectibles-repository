      "post_content": "Hi,\r\n\r\nHaving just started collecting I would like to get hold of some cheaper cards that are PSA graded, don't mind what grade really. I do prefer portraits but am open to anything really.\r\n\r\nOne thing I should mention is I am based in the UK but am prepared to pay the extra to have it shipped over of course. I do understand some sellers may not want this though which is fine.\r\n\r\nPM or email [url]jpwinn@hotmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nJoe",
