      "post_content": "Offered is buyers choice of one of Piedmont or Polar Bear Back T206 Cobbs in SGC 3. Price for either (I'm selling one only) is firm at $8150 net to me which includes overnight shipping. NO TRADES. You'll have it to show the family at Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nThe Polar Bear is really clean and centered. One light crease bottom as shown. \r\n\r\nThe color on the Piedmont is ridiculous. It also has severe diamond cut and wst on back (which I personally think is cool as crap). \r\n\r\nOne of these belongs in someone's collection \r\n\r\nI'll take (whichever you choose) in the comments takes it and its over. Good luck!",
