      "post_content": "Recently upgraded my Green Cobb so making this available. Asking $TRADED for it. Card is really nice for the grade. Formerly in a BVG 2 holder. Has a small crease left to right but image and color are really good.  Really nice card.\r\n\r\nI will consider trades\u2026..I\u2019m looking to get a PSA 3 Cobb bat on, if you have one available, let me know. Could work a deal on a 2 also\u2026..\r\n\r\nI\u2019m available via PM.  \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2mLyMRQ][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51700151582_db0f6cfc1a_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2mLGkzc][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51701624049_b2cfeb72e4_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
