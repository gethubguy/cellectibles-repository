Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nEthan - See if this helps.\n\nPosting Images to Net54 Boards:\n\nScanned image will need to be converted to .jpg \u2013 I use an old Google product called Picassa for that (there are others also)\n\nI use a Free Flickr (flickr.com) account for creating online albums and then uploading scanned .jpg images to the cloud.\n\nOnce you have uploaded an image to Flickr you will need to :\n\nSelect the image in your Flickr Album.\n\nScroll Down to \u201cViewing Privacy\u201d options and change from PRIVATE to PUBLIC.\n\nThen scroll back up and click on \u201cShare Photo\u201d which will give you several options for sharing.\n\nI typically use \u201cBBCODE\u201d and copy that link over to my Net 54 post and Submit.\n\nYour Image(s) will now appear in your post.\n\nThere are several other ways (including upload to Net54) but this has always worked for me.",
