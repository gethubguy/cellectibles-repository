I\u2019m still doing my name at top t206 set and I\u2019ve been putting them I\u2019m the tobacco sized top loaders but am having a hard time finding the ones I like.  Everything now is so thick that a single card with a soft sleeve just flops around inside. Does anyone have some of the thinner style they will part with?  If so, please email at [url]dmb102175@comcast.net[/url]. Thanks, Doug",
