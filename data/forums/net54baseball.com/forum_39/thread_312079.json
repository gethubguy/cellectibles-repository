That's why I bought it!\n\nColor and registration are off the charts. Crease free. Oh yeah, these are on fire. Asking $7750 net overnighted. I'll take it in the thread beats on-going negotiations, but honestly there's not much room here. These are trending similar to Goudey Ruths if anyone happens to be paying attention. Just saying",
