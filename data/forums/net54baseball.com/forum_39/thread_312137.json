Generally looking for lower quality raw cards, in tact with decent eye appeal. I'd also be fine with PSA/SGC A's, 1 or 2s if the price is right. These are the cards I am looking for in particular right now\r\n\r\nCrandall WITH Cap\r\n\r\nSC 350/460 - 42 OP\r\nAB 460\r\nCycle 460\r\nEPDG\r\nOld Mill\r\nPolar Bear\r\n\r\nKrause Portrait\r\n\r\nSC 350/25\r\nEPDG\r\n\r\nWright\r\n\r\nSC 350/25\r\nAB 350\r\nCycle 350\r\nEPDG\r\nSovereign 350\r\n\r\nBatch\r\n\r\nSC 350/30\r\nAB 350\r\nCycle 350\r\nEPDG\r\nSov 350\r\n\r\nDessau\r\n\r\nSC 350/30\r\nAB 350\r\nCycle 350\r\n\r\nSouthern Leaguers\r\n\r\nKing - Old Mill\r\nPaige - Piedmont 350\r\nLipe - Old Mill\r\nColes - Piedmont 350\r\nFoster - Piedmont 350\r\nOtey - Old Mill\r\nWestlake - Old Mill\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for any other portrait/back combos I don't currently have but it will all depend on price.
