This one has a date stamp on the back and I think it's the first I've seen that has a stamp.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with these (I'm not trying to put a hard sell on anyone, just provide a little info):  There were a few sheets of these cards sold on ebay one at a time over the course of a month or two about 5 years back.  The theory is that the cards were all meant to be printed with the Factory 42 Overprint, but they were pulled from production before that overprint was printed.  So, that's how this card can exist with a SC 350-460 Factory 30 back, when Downey was not printed with the factory 30 back.",
