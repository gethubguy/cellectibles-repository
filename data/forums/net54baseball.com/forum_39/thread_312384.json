      "post_content": "I know this is a long shot here, but I\u2019m looking to trade my ungraded 2011 Bowman Chrome draft Mike Trout refractor rookie for a lower grade (doesn\u2019t have to actually be graded) T-206 Mathewson, Young or Nap. Hoping one of you collects all eras like I do and we can swing a trade that we\u2019re both happy with. Accidentally posted same thread in the other BST Tobacco card sun (not t-206), so if someone could kindly delete I would appreciate it. If anyone is interested I will PM pics......the Trout is near perfect although I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t Gem if you sent it in. Visually with the naked eye, I cannot find any faults. \r\n\r\nJP",
