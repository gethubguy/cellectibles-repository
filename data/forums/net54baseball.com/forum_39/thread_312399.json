      "post_content": "FS: T206 Piedmont Dark Cap Mathewson. This one has been in my collection for well over 30 years. I never graded it and won\u2019t speculate what it would grade. It is a very pretty example. There is a light crease that runs through his glove and is visible on the reverse running through the M. It doesn\u2019t detract from the eye appeal.  I\u2019m asking $1650 delivered payment via PayPal. PM me if you are interested. Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\nMike",
