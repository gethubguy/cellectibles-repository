      "post_content": "Hello, friends. Looking to add to my modest T206 Brooklyn collection. List of cards I still need is below. \n\nAlso showing a pic of the cards I currently have to give a sense of the condition I collect: pretty good centering, no big creases, but round corners welcome. Would love to see what you have available.\n\nThank you! Jason\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20211223/74d67b0bdf821f590aea82347f1eb5f3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20211223/b519d4bcc64d3d526e5d3a73b75c115c.jpg[/IMG]",
