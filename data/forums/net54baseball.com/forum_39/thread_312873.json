      "post_content": "I live in Canada (and may be interested if the price and pictures are right).  When shipping to the US, as I understand it, import prices are paid by the purchaser and are based on the declared value of the cards.  You can artificially declare the value to be less than the actual value, but that will limit your insurance coverage if the package is lost.  It is also considered mail fraud, so you do it at your own peril.  I usually ship at full declared value, with full insurance coverage.  It is more expensive, but it\u2019s the only guarantee you are protected.  You will pay postage based on the declared value, amount of insurance, and size/weight of the package. That can be costly too, but there\u2019s no good way to avoid it\r\n\r\nYou also need to give consideration to your choice of shipper.  Since COVID hit, getting packages across the border in a timely fashion has been extremely difficult.  I\u2019ve had a few packages with basic traffic take over a month to arrive (and one never did arrive). You\u2019ll probably want to pay a bit extra to get expedited shipping, priority mail or a courier service).  It reduces the timelines, and gives you some proof of delivery in the event of a dispute.  \r\n\r\nUltimately the amount you pay depends on the value of what you\u2019re shipping, and the risk you are comfortable assuming.  I can\u2019t give you a flat cost estimate, but you\u2019ve got the basics to weigh into your calculations.   \r\n\r\nNow just let me know what you\u2019re selling\u2026:)",
