Its the old saying....buy the card not the grade.   PM or email me and I would be happy to give more info on contacting this particular seller.  But I do like the card.  Prices have been ticking up for portraits.  Its all about what the card means to you for the price.",

A lot of people have moved into the hobby in the last few years.  I think they are realizing that the new stuff is mass produced and highly speculative.  As a collector, I love the beauty and grace of the 110 year old cards.  They are not making any more of them.  I'm on a lot of the auction sites, and have read threads about high prices being paid for the portraits.  That is consistent with what I am seeing.  There are guys on here who have a lot more knowledge and experience than I do.  But that is my \"2 cents\", for what its worth.\r\n\r\nBrian",
