A smidge off left to right.  My PSA 4 wishes it was as nice.  I can't keep both or could I?\r\n\r\nLets give this a go. Full disclosure, this card is on its way back from PSA after the review process did not change the grade.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep it, for now, thanks for your inputs.\r\n\r\nThanks, Joe",

Or did they just pass it back to you along with the $100 fee (or whatever they are charging for that service level?\r\n\r\nKind of surprised they didnt give it the bump and then upcharge you the difference!
