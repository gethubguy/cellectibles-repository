PayPal family and friends is great, but I would also accept straight PayPal. I am disappointed in paying high eBay fees.\n\n(Sorry, but Eddie sold!)\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220120/f2f61ae1a8568c4729a4840e0c2211be.jpg[/IMG]\n\nA question on Eddie\u2019s rating. His card has not been trimmed. In fact, it may be slightly larger than normal. Therefore, I assume the \u201cA\u201d grade is for the miscut, losing his name. Did they not, in the past, grade cards independent of a miscut, and mark the cards also as miscut. I ask because I love this Collins card in its presentation, and I think the \u201cA\u201d grading is misleading.\nThanks for looking,\nJeff[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220120/39b5edc9c831cd2daf0463422f68dcb8.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220120/8b3ea13c1bafe04804a7699b72559402.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220120/b97d00a1c87a3dd87acd18e8042536d1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
