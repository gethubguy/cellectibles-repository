      "post_content": "Offered here is a very nice Oberlin Minneapolis with a Piedmont 350 back. The card is crease free with great color, clarity and centering. The card does display slightly rounded corners.  The back is solid with some honest age wear. Selling as ungraded with no guarantee what numerical grade SGC or PSA would give the card. It is a nice card and I would grade it as a raw vgex\r\n79.00 Net plus 5.00 shipping with tracking SOLD",
