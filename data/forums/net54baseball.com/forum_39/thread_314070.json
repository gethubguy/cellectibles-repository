      "post_content": "Hi guys, I'm a Canadian hockey nut (go figure) but with a huge soft spot for my long departed Montreal Expos, and the game of baseball.  I collect high end Hockey Cards and have recently sold off most of my smaller hockey cards in order to acquire some whales like Howe and Orr rookies.\n\nI'm looking to do the same with these cards, trade them all for one significant Graded Baseball card and was wondering if there might be a suitor in this group.  I'm very happy to add money.  Being from Montreal, I would like to ultimately have a Jackie Robinson, possibly the 1949 Bowman, but a nice T206 graded would be great also.\n\nAnyways, just throwing this out and hoping there may be a suitor.\n\nThe backs are Sweet Caporal and if you want to send me an email at [url]mark.bartholomew@hotmail.com[/url] I can send you more pictures",
