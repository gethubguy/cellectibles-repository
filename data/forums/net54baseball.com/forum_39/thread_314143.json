      "post_content": "Some years ago I had 20 older GAI graded T206s.  All had cert numbers beginning with 101, 102 or 103, indicating that they were graded early before any of the GAI shenanigans.  All twenty cards received grades from SGC when crossed.  Only three remain in my collection. \r\n\r\nMr. Fromme was in a GAI 4 holder and crossed to an SGC 60.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10592/fromme-pitching[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMr. Camnitz Hands over Head was in a GAI 7 holder and crossed to an SGC 70\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10607/camnitz-hands-over-head[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMr. Oakes was in a GAI 6 holder and crossed to an SGC 70 as well\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/10598/oakes[/IMG]\r\n\r\nChecks or money orders are the preferred method of payment over \r\nPP F&F, but I am willing to consider any of the three.  PayPal payments should not include any mention of a transaction, a card or a mailing address.  Just consider me a hobby friend who is under the weather, even though the sun is shining today.\r\n\r\nResponse via PM is preferred.  If you accept the asking price and are first in line you win.  If you choose to haggle, there is a possibility of losing your option to buy to a full price buyer.  Shipping is included in the asking price.\r\n\r\nAsking prices are\r\n\r\nALL SOLD",
