      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\r\nI recently had my OMSL subset slabbed SGC, cards look great in all new uniform holders, however my Revelle was too ugly to send so I\u2019m hoping to find a decent example to upgrade this guy.  Raw or Graded works, I can always have it re-slabbed to match the set.\r\n\r\nAnd while I think this Westlake card looks amazing and should have graded a 1 only due to that one darn corner, it did not, and its now my only southern leaguer sitting in an A holder, so it needs to go. \r\n\r\nAny help finding these two in decent condition is much appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks All\r\n\r\nColton\r\n[url]Nineunder71@hotmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\n.",

Hopefully, he comes back a 1 and gets to stay in the collection, fingers crossed. \r\n\r\nOn to ELLAM, this guy got a 1, but in my opinion is the ugliest of my 1\u2019s, so while I wait to see what happens with Westlake I will look to upgrade ole Roy\r\n\r\nAny help is Much Appreciated, thx All",
