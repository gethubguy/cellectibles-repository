I\u2019ve tried to price it based upon what I could locate online. If I am way off, my apologies. SOLD shipped (USPS First Class) payment via PP/FF. Hopefully someone here will appreciate this one more than I do. Sorry for the flash in the pics, if you need more pics or better pics please message me. Thanks.\r\n\r\nRob",
