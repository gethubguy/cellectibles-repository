Eventually I will be buying a version of this card back.\r\n\r\nThe person I acquired this from indicated it was an SGC A snap out, and my assumption is that it might be trimmed. That said, it is a very clean copy, as you can see from the scans. Light corner wear, but still sharp, very good registration and very bright colors, especially on the front. \r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51857145578_11559f8b03_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51857145798_2e34bd7db3_c.jpg[/img]",
