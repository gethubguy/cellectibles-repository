      "post_content": "Hi Everyone- I have a Johnny Kling PSA 4, that is a little too high for my current collection goals. Looking to trade it for a group of lower grade or raw portraits, or a trade for a couple HOF LOW GRADE or raws portraits. Asking price is $475, and that includes FedEx shipping.    Email me for pictures    [url]jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url]    or PM me!  Only interested in portraits that are low grade, which does not take away from integrity of card, and are major league only (no southern, minor league).  Thank You!!!",
