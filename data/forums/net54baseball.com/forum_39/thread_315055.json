Hoping I can make some trades with folks here versus just buying and selling. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any available and let\u2019s see if we can work something out.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJeff \r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2n2SZey][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51873449302_6e52d7623b_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2n2YiAe][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51874486613_eb5b2a666b_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2n32cR4][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51875052625_f82c6965e5_b.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2n32cR9][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51875052630_9e3a4cdf6a_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
