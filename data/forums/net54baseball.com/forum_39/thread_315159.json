      "post_content": "I've started on a new collecting goal to keep me occupied waiting on Des Moines OJs.  \r\n\r\nFrom my count there's 361 common T206s.  I'm going to see how many of them I can pick up for between $15-$25.  I know that many will say that I can't get them that cheap.  I started 3 weeks ago and have picked up a handful.  No condition is too rough.  This is just a fun project.  Curious to see how many I can get in 1 year.\r\n\r\nMessage me if you have any T206 that meet my terms.\r\n\r\nThanks Craig",
