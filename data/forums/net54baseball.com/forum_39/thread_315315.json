Looking to get ahead with some Southern Leaguer T206's....have put a good dent into the HOFer's but have only a few Southern Leaguers at this point...willing to do any combination of low grade (1-3 range) to equal value or throw a little cash either direction if necessary as well....\r\n\r\n(If you aren't familiar with these PC's, these are quite large.  Off the top of my head they may be 6x4 but I can measure this evening if somebody would need to know for sure.)  These are tough to find. \r\n\r\n[url=https://ibb.co/d66pS6S][img]https://i.ibb.co/2PPMwPw/1909-Atlanta-Crackers-PC-Bayless-F.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://ibb.co/y5LWxQF][img]https://i.ibb.co/gwszcRZ/1909-Atlanta-Crackers-PC-Bayless-B.jpg[/img][/url]",
