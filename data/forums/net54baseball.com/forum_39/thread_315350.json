None of his 3 poses have a spelling variation, they just finally spelled it correctly on his Portrait card in the last series.  I like Myers cards as an 'uncommon common', not a long career but one heck of a great player at the time his cards were issued.  Smashing .300 with ease when most catchers were absolutely terrible at the plate.",
