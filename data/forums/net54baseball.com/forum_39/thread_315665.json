Now that some time has passed since then, I am trying to get back in the swing of my t206 collecting and figured I would see what was available and where prices are right now (looks like they have risen quite a bit since I last bought cards in 2017). \r\n\r\nI only have somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 cards right now, so I think it would be easier for me to just say I am looking for any t206 commons that are graded in the 3-4 range. If I happen to have one of the cards you are offering, I will let you know.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you all again! Thanks.",
