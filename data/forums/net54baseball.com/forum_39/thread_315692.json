      "post_content": "Before I put this card up for auction on ebay, figured I would see if anyone is interested in trading my PSA 4 Johnny Kling for a PSA 1 or 2 Kling, and cash.\r\n\r\nAlso, would be willing to trade for T206 portraits, that have a sum equal to value of this card.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to PM me if interested, or email for scans of card.
