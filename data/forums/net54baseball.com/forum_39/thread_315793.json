Might have an opportunity to buy soon from a Net54 member. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a twist - if anyone is both coin AND card collector, I\u2019d love to put this beautiful pair of 1910 and 1911 $5 Indian Head gold coin cufflinks toward my Cobb. They have total weight of 29.2 grams and the accent gold is available 14kt\r\n\r\nI got some great advice on the water cooler section here and figure these are probably worth $1500-2000 (I already have 2 offers from local dealers for about $1400)\r\n\r\nI thought I might take a chance to see if anyone might be interested in these coin/cufflinks toward your Red Portrait Cobb. Probably a long shot that a Cobb seller is also a coin collector but you can\u2019t score if you don\u2019t shoot, Gretzky!\r\n\r\nSee images below. \r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\nJeff",
