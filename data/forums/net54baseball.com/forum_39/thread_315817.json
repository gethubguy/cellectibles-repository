      "post_content": "Chase $125 OBO - Decent corners.  Nicely centered.  Minor creasing.  Paper loss on the back near the top (above the words \"NEW\").\r\n\r\nHerzog $100 OBO - Presents as Ex/Mt, but a low technical grade due to the stamp on back and being O/C on back.  No creases or other issues.  \r\n\r\nMy scanner does not scan graded cards very well.  If you need better pics, PM me your email address and I'll send you pictures from my camera phone (it takes amazing high quality pics).  \r\n\r\nPrices listed are OBO and net to me.  A commitment to buy trumps ongoing negotiations.",
