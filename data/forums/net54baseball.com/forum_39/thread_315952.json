Am I crazy for thinking this looks more like a PSA 5 than a 2.5?\n\nP.S., I was thinking about bidding, so put it in the B/S/T forum, but apologies in advance if this belongs in the other forum.\n\n[URL=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/115261860964?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D237207%26meid%3Dbff8a95c1e664c9d819e6001e1740377%26pid%3D101195%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D154864783245%26itm%3D115261860964%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DSimplAMLv9PairwiseWebMskuAspectsV202110NoVariantSeedWithWeightedSampleMeHot&_trksid=p2047675.c101195.m1851&amdata=cksum%3A115261860964bff8a95c1e664c9d819e6001e1740377%7Cenc%3AAQAGAAACMO5CNkeAHCQBK38CwclDaMjrySl3hDb3ol4bMf4XivfmJPqN0qeOKyLK1G%252F2WPvsanJAWzDarGfjG99MUDW31US51Px4%252F00suXthuY1S%252F3UNediEy0c7mdtyPVYRxDCqUImWoWpQaCMogItX01iSs23NRpM8CrQ%252B1EXIOlB1a17C62rMKbynICUi5YM2DSr6DeZZ2RAtE3Z1g2pQJn2RqsvPlMAl7F5AC18VflinIz2lA6FOkbBEG0byBwYWzgvXhMLZ%252FL%252Bigw2VP24OGbpYZgQf8ovz1PC4DPIm3VTavLTuH%252FT1YZGOsP5m6QqE59tQYqDRIlTnIqJ8kNzvxlacVZ2x3jI7d0aCn4upa%252FeLzZk%252F9xhSY3EWiQMNNtDCHWliImDpe5gm0GrGNYBRLTSiuVIthqrDHaj3XXcDDoieJqBf1NpWHkA9D0x05YDorpEfK4j8B5DXKGnEx%252BvujQ4Gp9v9F33YUwh97Q4UaNpY8rEPyKOV21Xmq%252BU%252BDz3%252BZszlBWe8iAyO1diEbAg5w62eCRnzCas%252BFxt0v0xzUetx%252BvjGvomlKi1o9GFQ93ivJautWyqoLRLLluVBaN1zqoGdH1qKxv%252BP2d3Xc%252FCDZe7zbk5rvCOqaXVb7FFO73kOV%252Br78NJyYds%252FE78mEtYCH2oRJEsQonpU9q03o7v97efx0uft0%252F4ljYzMjfr%252B%252BHwr8VPolY5quOSqrJP9OFs11X0U0jiVpczgk4kKzU%252FHB9KyYQfo%7Campid%3APL_CLK%7Cclp%3A2047675\"]https://www.ebay.com/itm/115261860964?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D237207%26meid%3Dbff8a95c1e664c9d819e6001e1740377%26pid%3D101195%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D154864783245%26itm%3D115261860964%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DSimplAMLv9PairwiseWebMskuAspectsV202110NoVariantSeedWithWeightedSampleMeHot&_trksid=p2047675.c101195.m1851&amdata=cksum%3A115261860964bff8a95c1e664c9d819e6001e1740377%7Cenc%3AAQAGAAACMO5CNkeAHCQBK38CwclDaMjrySl3hDb3ol4bMf4XivfmJPqN0qeOKyLK1G%252F2WPvsanJAWzDarGfjG99MUDW31US51Px4%252F00suXthuY1S%252F3UNediEy0c7mdtyPVYRxDCqUImWoWpQaCMogItX01iSs23NRpM8CrQ%252B1EXIOlB1a17C62rMKbynICUi5YM2DSr6DeZZ2RAtE3Z1g2pQJn2RqsvPlMAl7F5AC18VflinIz2lA6FOkbBEG0byBwYWzgvXhMLZ%252FL%252Bigw2VP24OGbpYZgQf8ovz1PC4DPIm3VTavLTuH%252FT1YZGOsP5m6QqE59tQYqDRIlTnIqJ8kNzvxlacVZ2x3jI7d0aCn4upa%252FeLzZk%252F9xhSY3EWiQMNNtDCHWliImDpe5gm0GrGNYBRLTSiuVIthqrDHaj3XXcDDoieJqBf1NpWHkA9D0x05YDorpEfK4j8B5DXKGnEx%252BvujQ4Gp9v9F33YUwh97Q4UaNpY8rEPyKOV21Xmq%252BU%252BDz3%252BZszlBWe8iAyO1diEbAg5w62eCRnzCas%252BFxt0v0xzUetx%252BvjGvomlKi1o9GFQ93ivJautWyqoLRLLluVBaN1zqoGdH1qKxv%252BP2d3Xc%252FCDZe7zbk5rvCOqaXVb7FFO73kOV%252Br78NJyYds%252FE78mEtYCH2oRJEsQonpU9q03o7v97efx0uft0%252F4ljYzMjfr%252B%252BHwr8VPolY5quOSqrJP9OFs11X0U0jiVpczgk4kKzU%252FHB9KyYQfo%7Campid%3APL_CLK%7Cclp%3A2047675[/URL]",
