      "post_content": "T206 Cy Young Portrait -- SGC 1.5\r\n\r\nSubmitted to SGC in July 2021, so relatively recently graded.  Thought it had a solid shot at a 2.\r\n\r\nPresents really nicely in hand.  Lower right corner is the biggest issue.  A couple of light wrinkles on the front that do not appear to penetrate the back...neither impacts his visage.  Those are a little more visible on the picture with the flash glare...they really aren't very obtrusive\r\n\r\nAsking $2450 shipped,  net PayPal.  \r\n\r\nI will listen to reasonable offers and have a little wiggle room on this...but this stacks up nicely to recent auction comps...feel free to reach out via PM with questions.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nMike",
