The signatures are clear and legible.\n\nNone of the sigs are HoF's, but neat and cool none the less.\n\nThe autographs were obtained in person by myself about 6 years ago.  The players are all well into their 70's and 80's.  Two have since passed.\n\nWhat I am looking for is a t206 in trade.\n\nAll I ask is that I receive a card that I do not have, and we can work out details if you are interested.\n\nI will let you determine the value.\n\nI can send you images as I do not have a scanner.\n\n\nLou",
