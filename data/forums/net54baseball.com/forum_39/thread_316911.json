      "post_content": "This sale begins at midnight 3/19/22 in the time zone in which you live.  It ends 24 hours later at midnight 3/20/22.  If you choose to purchase a card within 1 minute of the vernal equinox in your time zone, the asking price will be significantly discounted.  The beginning and end of the auction and the timing of the discount will vary depending on your location.  Shipping is free.  Payments are net to me.  Once again PP F&F is accepted as long as you do not reference a purchase, an address or any other mention that would suggest a sale.  You give me the money and I will give you the card in return.  Checks and money orders are also welcome.  Here are the offerings:\r\n\r\n\r\nPat McCauley - PSA 2 - OMSL - $280\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/10471/mccauley-omsl[/IMG]\r\n\r\nJohn McGraw HOF - Glove at Hip - SGC 4 - Polar Bear - $444\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/31477/mcgraw-glove-at-hip-pb[/IMG]\r\n\r\nGeorge Merritt - PSA 5 - P350 - $300\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/57852/merritt[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAmbrose Puttman - PSA 5 - P350 - $275\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-psa/10556/puttman[/IMG]\r\n\r\nGeorge Perring - SGC 5.5 - P350 - $240\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/frankbmd/t206-sgc/17717/perring[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPlease respond via PM with your method of payment and mailing address which will be used for time zone verification.  \r\n\r\nThe total amount allotted for the discount will be shared by up to five winners equally.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the judge (me) is final.
