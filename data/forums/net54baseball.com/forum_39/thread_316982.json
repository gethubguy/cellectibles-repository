      "post_content": "Hello- I now have two Addie Joss portraits. \n\n I am looking to trade my SGC 50/4 for either Cobb portrait that is graded Authentic or a 1.  \n\nAlso looking to trade for a Walter Johnson Portrait of equal value, or a Cy Young Portrait\n\nMust have a clean front, creases are ok. I have some other portrait duplicates in possession as well I would throw in.    Please email me at [url]jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url] or PM me.  Hope to hear from someone!  Thanks, James",
