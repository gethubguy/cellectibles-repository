So if you're interested, this is last chance before you'll have to just bid later this summer.\n\n\nNeed to move a few old things to make room for a couple new things.\n\nI'll take it takes precedent over any negotiations.\n\nPrices are delivered and net to me, or add 3% for G&S.\n\nCan provide additional pictures if needed, just let me know.\n\nDM or email to [url]david@davidratliff.com[/url]\n\nI would consider some partial trade in certain instances, but needs to be HOF graded and/or liquid enough that I could sell for comp values, as I really do need to raise some funds.\n\nLet's do some deals!",

      "post_content": "Wajo Portrait PSA 2 - $NLFS\nHuggins & Scott just sold an SGC 2 for $3,444, this one is easily better.\nIt's not really stains (which is an optional qualifier now anyway), maybe it got wet at some point and bled?\nRegardless, great registration as well.\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/vYqJc6ql.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/5GDtZt3l.jpg[/img]\n\n\nMatty Portrait PSA 2.5 - $NLFS\nLast PSA 2.5 got $2.9k in mid-March, this one is a far better example.  That \"ding\" on the right edge is what held this back, possibly an entire grading point?\nReally nice color and registration.\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/X1fojRYl.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/5zLwITWl.jpg[/img]\n\n\nYoung Portrait PSA 2 - $NLFS\nLast PSA 2 got $2.8k, this one has a bit better centering.  Nice deep green and great registration.\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/5ukn6Yvl.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/181COHUl.jpg[/img]\n\n\nMatty Dark Cap SGC 50 - Polar Bear - $NLFS\nPolar Bears graded 4 and higher are actually tougher than most people think.  Also, this is his only pose with a Polar Bear back.\nThere's only 8 higher in SGC, and 10 higher than a 4 in PSA.  This is a tough card that gets overlooked due to general views on Polar Bear backs. \n[img]https://i.imgur.com/M7UW3wFl.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/gCaue49l.jpg[/img]",
