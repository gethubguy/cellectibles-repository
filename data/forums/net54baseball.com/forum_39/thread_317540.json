You may have a lower grade Broadleaf and want to trade up and have a low grade CB or Hindu to throw in, etc...same with the Lajoie...willing to listen for low grade rare backs.  \r\n\r\n[url=https://ibb.co/Y2WXxt4][img]https://i.ibb.co/qBnCvRL/1910-T206-Clancy-Broadleaf-F.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://ibb.co/d2x68tL][img]https://i.ibb.co/QNtnykC/1910-T206-Clancy-Broadleaf-B.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[url=https://ibb.co/mXcKR20][img]https://i.ibb.co/QCKVJTk/1910-T206-Lajoie-SV350-F.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://ibb.co/rvXm41b][img]https://i.ibb.co/wY2RMxJ/1910-T206-Lajoie-SV350-B.jpg[/img][/url]",
