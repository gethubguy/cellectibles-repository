      "post_content": "Hi all - for sale is a lot of 12 T206's, including 4 HOF's, all in poor condition.  The creasing on most of them is pretty evident in the pics.  On the Matty Portrait, the crease going through his head is so severe that the card is actually TORN about 1/3 of the way from the left border.  This one is quite fragile.  The Huggins looks like someone/something was snacking on the bottom border.  Fred Merkle has writing on the back.  The Ames portrait has discoloration along the right border.  And yes, poor Tommy Leach has a hole right through his chest.  Needless to say, these cards have issues.  \n\nPrice is SOLD, delivered net to me for the dirty dozen.  I'd also be up for a trade.  I collect mostly T206's, but have other pre-war interests as well.\n\nClaim in thread or PM me with your email if you want better pics.\n\nThanks,\nAnthony",
