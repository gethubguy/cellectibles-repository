      "post_content": "Offered here is aT206 cards with a clean Polar Bear back that is ungraded. They are both nice.  \r\nThe Payne card is nice with slightly rounded corners with a touch of product staining in the white borders. For accuracy there is a very small wrinkle in the left side border about eye level that is about 1/4\". It isnt visible in the scan. I would guess this one to be in the 3.5 range at SGC. I only can guarantee it is authentic and measures correctly. Polar Bear backs have become more collectible as of late . Price is net to me, plus 5.00 shipping with tracking\r\nSOLD",
