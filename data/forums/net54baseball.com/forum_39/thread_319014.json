      "post_content": "Zero graded cards for sale: Tom Needham, SGC 2, (SOLD) has a rare Sweet Caporal back. According to the T206 Society, Sweet Caporal 350-460, Factory 25, is 19/39 in scarcity, more scarce than EPDG or American Beauty 350 frame, for example. PSA pop reports lists only  5 graded examples, with only 2 graded higher than the card I am offering. For Pat Moran, (SOLD)\nEither card is $137, with $3 for shipping. Shipping is the same for one or both cards.[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220501/57a32bd3d25c4ff37a704e9c3899fe4c.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220501/2b87cfd19b688fcec4523207289cc88b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220501/0d95ca47bcde1208e843084f82dc422a.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220501/4fef499fada1160ba7861ed4b6b0d1a0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",

Their T206 book, The T206 Collection,  is fabulous, and I have purchased four great T206 cards from the organization. \n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",

      "post_content": "One last item about the Sweet Caporal 350-460, factory 25 subset. The number of graded cards specifically in that subset will not include the cards graded before PSA or SGC separated the card grading by factory. I do not know when that occurred, but there certainly are cards graded but not identified by factory that fall in the more rare categories. So, the PSA or SGC pop reports will somewhat \u201coverstate\u201d the rarity of the Piedmont 350-460, factory 42, or the Sweet Cap 350-460, factory 25, for example.\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
