Looks like this was stacked on another Evers, and it picked up the bat and some of his sleeve/belt.\n\nSOLD\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220506/7bde04d2f2a7f9b2c270735f0fcc8368.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220506/5a945efd64f7bf498f04ae3f2e1ee235.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
