      "post_content": "I started collecting these in 2013, and at my high water point had 104 different Sweat Caporal Front/Back combinations of the Cubs.  Over the last couple of years I have been trading or selling off a good portion of my collection to pursue other card interests.  Now I have decided that with prices where they are, I will probably not attempt another run at this subset, so I am offering the balance of what's left for sale.  Some of the cards offered are extremely tough front/back combinations, including a good number of factory 350/25 & 350-460/25 & 42 backs. A couple of the cards listed are in the top 3-5 condition wise known to exist for their respective front/back combinations.  There were quite a few of these that I have only found 1 or 2 examples of that have been on the market over the last 9 years.\r\n     I lieu of posting pictures of all of these cards, I am only putting up the complete list.  If you would like scans of the cards, I will be more than happy to email front/back scans of any of the cards.  I will take care of shipping costs, all cards will ship Priority Mail.  Payment via PayPal F/F is preferred, but I am willing to possibly accept other forms of payment.  \"I'll take it\" will own card over any [B]ongoing negotiations for the same card, I will try to get back to everyone as quick as I can, but I do have a day job, so requests during the day may have a little delay in getting replied to.\r\n    Here is the complete list, and hopefully these cards can find new homes with some Net54 members.  You can reach me by PM or email [url]Asmusstephen@gmail.com[/url]\r\n\r\nMordecai Brown (Chicago on Shirt) SC 350-460/42   SGC 5          $1800\r\nMordecai Brown (Cubs on Shirt)SC 150/30            SGC 2        $450\r\nFrank Chance (Batting)SC 350-460/25            SGC 4       $1000\r\nFrank Chance (Yellow Portrait)SC 350-460/42    SGC 2.5$550\r\nJohnny Evers (Chicago on Shirt)SC 350/25            SGC 4        $750\r\nRube KrohSC 350/25                                            SGC 2.5$135\r\nHarry McIntyre (Bkln & Chi)SC 350/25            SGC 2        $105\r\nHarry McIntyre (Bkln & Chi)SC 350-460/42    PSA  4        $215\r\nHarry McIntyre (Bkln & Chi)SC 350-460/42(OP)PSA  4        $215\r\nPat MoranSC 350/25                                            SGC 3.5$225\r\nTom NeedhamSC 350-460/25                            PSA 4.5        $375\r\nTom NeedhamSC 350-460/42(OP)                    SGC  3        $175\r\nOrval Overall (Hands @ Waist)SC 350-460/42(OP)PSA  2        $100\r\nJeff PfefferSC 350-460/42(OP)                            SGC  3        $175\r\nEd Reulbach (No Glove Showing)SC 350-460/25    SGC  2        $140\r\nEd Reulbach (No Glove Showing)SC 350-360/42(OP)SGC 1.5$165\r\nFrank Schulte (Back View)Old Mill            PSA   2(MK)$250\r\nFrank Schulte (Back View)SC 350-460/25            SGC   5        $650\r\nFrank Schulte (Back View)SC 350-460/42(OP)    SGC   3        $250\r\nJimmy Sheckard (Glove Showing) SC 350-460/42(OP)SGC  2$100\r\nJimmy Sheckard (No Glove Showing)Soveriegn 350SGC   1$100\r\nJimmy Sheckard (No Glove Showing)SC 150/25     SGC   4        $200\r\nJimmy Sheckard (No Glove Showing)SC 350/30    PSA    3        $130\r\nHarry Steinfeldt (With Bat)SC 350/25                    PSA    4        $315\r\nHarry Steinfeldt (Portrait)SC 350/25                    SGC   4        $500\r\nJoe Tinker (Hankds on Knees)SC 350/25            PSA   2.5$625\r\nHeinie ZimmermanSC 350/25                            PSA    3        $200\r\n\r\n[STRIKE]Mordecai Brown (Chicago on Shirt) SC 350/30    SGC 2        $450[/STRIKE] SOLD[STRIKE]\r\nFrank Chance (Batting)SC 350-460/42            SGC 2.5$350[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Frank Chance (Yellow Portrait)SC 350-460/30    PSA 1(MK)$150[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Orval Overall (Hands @ Face)SC 350/25            PSA   2        $125[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Orval Overall (Hands @ Waist)Sovereign 350-460 PSA  3        $325[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Orval Overall (Hand @ Waist)SC 350-460/25    PSA  3        $160 [/STRIKE]SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Orval Overall (Potrait)SC 350/25                            PSA   3        $275[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jeff PfefferAmerican Beauty 460                    PSA  2(MC)$250[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jake Pfeister (Seated)SC 350/25                    PSA  3.5$225[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jake Pfeister (Seated)Polar Bear            PSA   2        $115[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jake Pfeister (Throwing)Sovereign 350              PSA   3        $235[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jake Pfeister (Throwing)SC 350-460/42(OP)    PSA   5        $400[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Jimmy Sheckard (Glove Showing) SC 350-460/30     PSA    3$165[/STRIKE] SOLD\r\n[STRIKE]Frank Schulte (Front View)SC 150/25                    PSA    1        $145[/B[/STRIKE]] SOLD\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve",
