      "post_content": "I just picked up another one of these for the all PSA 2 set so this one needs a new home.  Obvious issues but it's still a stunning card despite them.  \r\n\r\nAsking $7,100 net which includes shipping via registered mail.  Happy to entertain trades in part or in full for other PSA 2 HoF players I need for that set or t206 in the 6-7 range that would upgrade there.\r\n\r\nPM or email me at [url]tbrambo@yahoo.com[/url] to discuss.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
