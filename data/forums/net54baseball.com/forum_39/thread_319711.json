      "post_content": "Available is the start to an all PSA 1 set that I abandoned after realizing I would rather work on the other sets I have.  39 cards in all and all are graded PSA 1 with no qualifiers.  Please don't ask me to break the group for the Cobbs or HoF only as I'd prefer to sell as a group right now.  \r\n\r\nHere's a full list:\r\n\r\n        Arellanes, Frank\r\nSLBay, Harry\r\nBecker, Beals\r\nBell, George (Pitching, Follow through) \r\nHOF Chance, Frank (Portrait Yellow Background) \r\nChase, Hal (Throwing-Dark Cap)\r\nHOFCobb, Ty (Bat Off Shoulder)\r\nHOF Cobb, Ty (Bat On Shoulder) \r\nHOF Collins, Eddie (Philadelphia) \r\nCrandall, Doc (No Cap)\r\n Donovan, Bill (Wild) (Portrait) \r\nHOF Flick, Elmer \r\nGandil, Chick\r\nGanley, Bob\r\nGanzel, John\r\nGoode, Wilbur\r\nGray, Dolly\r\nHOFGriffith, Clark (Batting)\r\nSL Hickman, Gordon \r\n Howell, Harry (Portrait) \r\n Jacklitsch, Fred \r\nHOFJennings, Hughie (One hand showing)\r\nHOFJennings, Hughie (Portrait)\r\nJones, Fielder (Chi)\r\nKnight, Jack (Portrait)\r\nHOF Lajoie, Nap (Portrait) \r\nLake, Joe  St. Louis, (No Ball)\r\nHOF Marquard, Rube (Pitching- Follow Through) \r\nHOF McGraw, John (Portrait With Cap) \r\nOwen,  Frank\r\nParent, Fred\r\nPattee,  Harry\r\nPhelan,  Jimmy\r\nSL Ryan, Ray \r\n Shaw, Al \r\n Titus, John \r\nHOFWallace, Bobby (Portrait)\r\nHOF Willis, Vic (Portrait) \r\n Young, Irv (Minneapolis) \r\n\r\nAsking price is $13,000 net and includes registered mail shipping.  Happy to entertain trades in part or in full as well but only for t206 PSA 2 HoF players I need or PSA 6-7 upgrades I need for that t206 set.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the registry w/front and back scans of all:\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/psasetregistry/baseball/t206-sets/1909-11-t206-complete-player-image-set-no-wagner-doyle-n-y-natl-plank-magie/publishedset/455885[/url]\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me at [url]tbrambo@yahoo.com[/url] or PM here to discuss.\r\n\r\nScans of the Cobbs are below.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTroy",
