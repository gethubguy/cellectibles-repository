So I'd say this is probably VG. I'm looking to sell/trade it. Willing to trade for 1960s-early 1970s stars and HOFers. Or I'd consider selling for $45 shipped F/F. A VG-VG-Ex went for $100, while a VG went for $55. Thanks for the look.\n\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/qq9poUT.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Yuety21.jpg[/img]",
