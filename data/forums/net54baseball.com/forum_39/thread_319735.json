      "post_content": "I've been working on a fun project over the past 8 months, and have accumulated a lot of low grade and raw duplicates.  Most of these I have purchased as part of \"lots\", which has resulted in many duplicates.  \n\nAll orders over $100 are free shipping.  $5 for all orders less than $100.  Shipping will include tracking.\n\nI will also do discounts for multiple cards being purchased in same order.  \n\nAll prices are PayPal FF net to me.  \n\nFirst \"I'll take it\" supersedes all on going negotiations.  Please PM or email me at [url]frankbev29@yahoo.com[/url] with any questions.  \n\nGraded Cards:\n\nDavis PSA 2 = $70\nGanzel PSA 1.5 = $65\nSchreck PSA 1.5 = $70\nSharpe PSA 1.5(MK) = $60\nSeymour Throwing (Polar Bear Back) SGC 1 = $70\nCongalton SGC 2 = $70\nChase Holding Trophy SGC 3 = $230\nDoc White Portrait BVG 3 = $SOLD\nWallace SGC 2.5 = $225\n\nIndividual Raw Cards:\n\nGermany Schaefer Sovereign 150 = $350\nKrause Portrait = $70\n\nRaw Card Lots:\n\nAll lots below are sold in 3 card lots.
