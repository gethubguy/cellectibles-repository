      "post_content": "Here's one you don't see every day (or ever) -- I had this original 1909-11 T206 Ty Cobb autographed by Herschel Cobb a few years ago.  Herschel is Cobb's grandson, and authored this book:  \r\n\r\n[url]https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Tiger-Growing-Grandfather-Cobb/dp/B00GDSMFVK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1EOEKXSLC7YFQ&keywords=herschel+cobb&qid=1652808140&sprefix=herschel+cobb%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-2[/url]\r\n\r\nI'm asking SOLD on it, delivered with insurance, which in my view is a fair price in this market even if you don't consider who signed it as adding value.  Great chance to own an authentic T206 Cobb at a low price, with a little bit of baseball history attached to it! \r\n\r\nEmail me at [url]SignedT206@gmail.com[/url] if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52080472016_3af67b3938_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52080960380_7c8ca36611_b.jpg[/img]",
