      "post_content": "Hi all - for sale is a T206 Walter Johnson Portrait with a Piedmont 150 back.  The card is well centered, but has some flaws that can be seen in the pics.  Price is PENDING net to me delivered, but I might also be up for a trade/partial trade.  Maybe a centered 1933 Goudey Foxx #29?  I'm interested in other cards as well, but that's the first thing that popped in my head.  Anyway, thanks for looking!",
