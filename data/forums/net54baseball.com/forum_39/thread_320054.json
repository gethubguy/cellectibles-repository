      "post_content": "Longtime lurker, first post.  I\u2019m looking to buy T206s (lower value) in raw condition that would grade in the 2-3 range.  I\u2019m not looking to grade, just giving a general idea of the condition I\u2019m looking for. Not interested in major creases, paper loss, hand writing, stamping or significant staining.  Would prefer to buy in quantity, but okay with single purchases.  Right now I only have 20, so not sure if I\u2019m going to make a run at the set, sans the BIG 4.  I have a ton of feedback on eBay and Blowout forums if needed.  I\u2019m still getting my feet wet with this set/chase so please forgive any ignorance on my end.  Thanks!",
