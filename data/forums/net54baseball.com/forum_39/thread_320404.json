      "post_content": "This is a revival of a traditional N54 thread, established well before I joined.\nThe idea is to create a centralized market place for those who want to trade.\n\nMyself, I want to add some new cards to my collection.\nSupply and prices being what they are, the time to trade has come.\n\nAnyone who wants to trade is welcome to post.\n\nI prefer ungraded cards for my binder collection, but I'll trade for graded too.\nI'm always looking to upgrade any card, but am interested in SC 460/25's, off-backs, back-stamps, h-o-f, in particular.\n\nI have a basic collection of 518, but now I collect all different backs and have well over 700, so I have many bigger cards [h-o-f'ers, off-backs] to trade if you have bigger cards but are not interested in these.\n\n\n\nUngraded, with my estimated grade:\n\nBell, follow through, SC460/30, G, \nDonlin batting, SC 350/30, Fair, \nJENNINGS, one hand, SC 460/42 OP, G, \nElberfeld, SC460/25, G-VG, \nBell, follow through, SC460/30, G-VG,\nBall, Clev, hands at chest, SC 460/25, Poor,\nHoffman, St. L, SC 350/30, F-G, \nHoffman, Providence, Polar Bear, [G] \n \nJones, St. L., SC 150/30,  [Like Schlei below, I bought this on ebay and thought it was okay.   Now looking it over in hand, I think it's trimmed].\nBay, Piedmont 350/25 [SL], has clipped corners, no apparent creases, \nSchlei batting, Old Mill, is short, doesn't look trimmed, but ... miscut at best.\n\nNew additions [not pictured}:\n\nMurphy batting SC 460/25, G-VG,\nKonetchy fielding, SC 460/25, G,\nDonovan portrait, Old Mill, presents well, but I'd say trimmed on top,\nGRIFFITH batting, Poor, specks of paper-loss on back.\n\nNote on scans: As the page turns, the backs are in opposite order.\n\nHere's a list of the graded cards: \n\nSC 350-460/25:\n\nBergen catching, SGC 40,\nLake, StL, ball in hand, SGC 40,\nMcGraw, portrait, with cap, SGC 40,\nRed Murray, portrait, SGC 20,\nHerzog, in sweater, PSA 3,\nStovall batting, SGC 20,\n\nLefty Leifeld, striped sleeves, Old Mill, PSA 1.\n\nScans of these to come/upon request.",
