      "post_content": "Hi all, I have this Old Mill Ty Cobb Red Portrait available for sale this week.\r\n\r\nThis card presents very well but is altered. It has been retouched around the D on front and the red has been recolored at the very top. On the back you can see areas of erasure with parts of the border and letters redrawn back in (tastefully done, if I do say so myself!)\r\n\r\nFull disclosure that I sent this to SGC and they declined to grade. Their claim was that it was too fragile to slab, but I suspect that they were uncomfortable with the degree of alteration. I have emails with them that I am happy to share if interested. I am planning to send it off to CSG if there are no takers this week (I have already been in touch with their customer support about slabbing this card with these alterations) to get it slabbed as an \"Authentic Altered\" but thought that somebody might be interested in this one raw and save me the time and trouble.\r\n\r\n[strike]Asking $3000 delivered[/strike] -- card has been Traded 6/3/2022\r\n\r\nWould also consider Trades or Cash + Trade for other pre-war HOFers. Especially looking for presentable, low grade T206 Matty, Johnson, Lajoie, Speaker and Walsh right now.\r\n\r\nPhotos below, [URL=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/qUzVoqqXLR39MB5z9\"]here is a link too[/URL] that lets you zoom in a bit more. \r\n[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUWj4Dszv6y56J9l36lOrvQtT0Q-HrU-rPieovu27QWwFxwFVUpWFBenccuDA31hgy5wkrkIl-dUA9BnENqCvUq0r_yQzcqXHqQdUINqUQ2AZHq6C7PGGD4Iyu3UxfuKMUsCbN-Zhs36oWhe6yzlb0mOA=w450-h599-no?authuser=0[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWLgAvb4wziMUlUtOUZpWFgey20SIb-Dbet6wcyuZkq-SDeZ8yeyV6OYkr8Mp_uJ3uOczMziOvZMVWiP4T1K4Xv4ugDZ544A8ECTE7pRhLYBx-dIq0fWqDClUAdFORzkMMnn_xZFds7ld8KxEJC-sQoyA=w450-h599-no?authuser=0[/IMG]",
