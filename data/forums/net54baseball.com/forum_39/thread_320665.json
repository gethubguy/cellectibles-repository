      "post_content": "Hello all,\n\nWTB a Frank Smith (F Smith version) T206 PSA 6 or higher.  Probably can\u2019t afford anything above a 7 at this point but also happy to look at those if you have.  I may have some trade bait - more likely looking to do cash.  Back agnostic, but I do like off backs.\n\nFeel free to email [url]Paul.curlee1@gmail.com[/url] or text me at 915-449-7623.  Thanks!",
