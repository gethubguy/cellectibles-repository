      "post_content": "Hi. \r\n\r\nI would like to buy your lower grade EPDGs that you may be looking to part with.\r\n\r\n* I'm generally fine with issues on the front of the card, I'd like to avoid holes in the card if possible\r\n* I'm looking for nicer backs without paper loss on the actual red printing, if possible, but a small imperfection won't be a dealbreaker\r\n* If I have the subject with a different back, I'd be willing to trade/add cash to equal it out, if you are interested in just downgrading (or in a few cases, upgrading) to a different back. I'm happy to just pay cash too. \r\n\r\nI only have a handful of EPDG backs, so this is the beginning of my quest. I'm generally going to avoid graded copies due to cost consideration, but if you have a really nice A or a 1 or 2 with good eye appeal at a reasonable cost, that works too. \r\n\r\nThanks",
