      "post_content": "Hello- I have a Lundgren Chicago Piedmont 150 for sale ($750). It is raw. Front looks incredible, and back has a couple missing spots that hurt the integrity.\r\n\r\nI would also be willing to trade this, and an Ames Piedmont 150 hands at chest for a graded Lundgren Chicago in the 1-3 range, preferably SGC (keep the wife happy with that holder).\r\n\r\nI am flexible, feel free to email me at [url]jamesmckee2018@gmail.com[/url] for pictures and/or offers.",
