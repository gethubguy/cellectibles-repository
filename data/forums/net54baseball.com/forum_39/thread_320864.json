      "post_content": "For sale is a t206 Frank Isbell Sovereign 150 raw (G/VG).  This card is colloquially known as the \u201ctoughest\u201d sovereign 150.  Crease running from top middle on front of card leftward to the edge about 1/3rd of the way down the card.  Back is dirty but not stained and doesn\u2019t detract from the overall sovereign brand picture.  This is the card that sold on eBay back in February and generated a thread in the discussion part of this site.  Looking for $800 shipped. PayPal f&f. I can take more pics if you\u2019d like - but I posted it here with an sgc 3 sov 150 Isbell for reference.",
