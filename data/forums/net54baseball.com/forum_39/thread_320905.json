One of the other PSA 4s recently sold for $13,200 with multiple surface issues and off-centered from left to right.  \r\n\r\nI am asking $13,750 net, via PayPal. I will pay to overnight it to the buyer.\r\n\r\nPlease PM me or email [url]matt@gentryfinancialgroup.com[/url] to purchase or ask questions.
