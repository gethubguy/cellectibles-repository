I've made deals with a lot of people on here after messaging people on eBay - and would obviously prefer to sell to Net54ers, and with the addition of Sales Tax, I know both buyers and sellers are looking to go off eBay to complete a transaction. Also, I will happily never bump this again if anyone is annoyed by it. \r\n\r\n\r\nJust PM or email me at [url]the.cards.of.our.pastime@gmail.com[/url] with what you are looking for, or with what you have interest in. You can make an offer or ask for my best price. I'm not offended by price offers and will always respond. Offer me $1 for a Cobb and I will politely decline. Worst that can happen is that we disagree and go about our business, I'll think nothing of it. At bare minimum, you can assume to take off at least 10% and know that I will accept the offer. \r\n\r\neBay Links: \r\n\r\n[URL=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/m.html?toolid=20001&mkcid=1&_ssn=the_coop&_osacat=0&campid=5338812911&_armrs=1&siteid=0&_sop=15&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&customid=link&_odkw=T206+-rp+-reprint+-psa+-sgc+-sale&_from=R40&_trksid=p2046732.m570.l1313&_nkw=T206+-rp+-reprint+-psa+-sgc+-sale+-uncut&_sacat=0\"]Ungraded T206s[/URL] \r\n\r\n[URL=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/m.html?_ssn=the_coop&_osacat=0&_armrs=1&_odkw=T206+-rp+-reprint+-psa+-sgc&_from=R40&_trksid=p2046732.m570.l1313&_nkw=T206+-rp+-reprint+%28psa%2C+sgc%29&_sacat=0\"]Graded T206s (PSA & SGC)[/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding payment - I prefer Paypal F/F but won't make a deal contingent upon it - nor will I add 3%.
