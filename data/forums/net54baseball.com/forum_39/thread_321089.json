      "post_content": "Hi all, I\u2019m looking to buy a common back Matty portrait in the 1-1.5 grade range, depending on price. No pin holes or tears, and not interested in a beater or altered example. Some paper loss or wrinkles are ok. I prefer graded but would consider raw, as well. I found an SGC 1 on ebay that\u2019s tempting but wanted to check here first.\r\n\r\nPM me if anyone out there has one for sale!\r\n\r\nThanks!",
