Since I am working on the complete set as well, I try to avoid buying duplicate cards just for the sake of the back. \r\n\r\nOf course I forgot I already had a Devore, so I am looking to trade this one for a comparable Tolstoi of a different player. I would also consider old mills and other mid range backs. \r\n\r\nThanks!",
