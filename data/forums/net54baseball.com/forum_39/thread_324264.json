      "post_content": "Looking to buy T206 cards that recently went through ebay via Greg Morris. They were part of a scrapbook collection that was sold as a group on HA initially. Almost all have red tape on the backs which held them in place at one time. Most also have paper loss on backs from removal. Most are also Sweet Cap. Interested in commons and stars. Singles and groups. If one is in your collection I may be able to trade you the same card w/o tape. Have done that several times already. Please message what you have. I also have a post in the FB groups. Thanks",
