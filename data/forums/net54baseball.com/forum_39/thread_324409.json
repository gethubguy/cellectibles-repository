      "post_content": "Looking to build a HOF set of graded (preferably SGC) t206 cards mostly portraits. I have tons of antique uniforms and equipment from 1900 to 1920s. I\u2019m selling off a lot of my stuff to buy these cards and would like to trade instead. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested please let me know. There\u2019s something about putting on an old glove or holding an old cap and jersey like the ones pictured in the cards. \r\n\r\nI have many listings on eBay: [url]https://www.ebay.com/usr/vintagebaseballbats[/url]\r\n\r\nI also just posted here on net54 a 1930s Hillerich and Bradsby monster 42 in store window display bat. \r\n\r\nLet me know if interested. \r\n\r\nThanks \r\nMark",
