Being OCD, I can't look at it in my PSA HOF portrait display without seeing the difference from all of my other clear backed PSA T206 portraits! :D\r\n\r\nI would love to trade this card for another portrait HOFer that I need and I can add cash based on the grade/value difference if necessary. Needs to be graded either PSA or SGC.\r\n\r\nIf you have anything available, please feel free to shoot me a PM.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nThese are the portraits that I need:\r\n\r\nFred Clarke\r\nJimmy Collins\r\nJohn Evers\r\nClark Griffith\r\nHughie Jennings\r\nRube Marquard\r\nJohn McGraw\r\nJoe Tinker\r\nVic Willis\r\n\r\nWould also consider Sherry Magee",
