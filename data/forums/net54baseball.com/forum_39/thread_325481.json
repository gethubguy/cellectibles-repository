Again, I have a bottom line on this card, based on all recent sales, and the back of this card as well as how the front looks and what is being asked on here AND EBay. The front quality on this is very good, so is the back and it being Old Mill.\r\n\r\n Would love to get this shipped out FedEx TODAY or MONDAY!!!!! Listening to offers, as I missed out on something I needed from Heritage. \r\n\r\nFeel free to email me or text at 719-757-0008.  Look at what I am asking above, and do the math on what eBay takes as a cut or consigning and make an offer. Listening to them all today!",
