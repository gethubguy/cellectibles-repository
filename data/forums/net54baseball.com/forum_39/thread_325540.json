Any Backs are fine, but no qualifiers, please. \r\n\r\n1) Bell, Hands over Head \r\n2) Chase, Pink Portrait \r\n3) Evans\r\n4) Schulte, Front view \r\n\r\nI have plenty of good trade bait or can pay cash.  Also happy to pay a finder\u2019s fee if someone could help track one or all of these down.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\nJoey",
