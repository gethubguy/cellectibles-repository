Another Sweet Caporal PSA 1 sold for $3899 in September. Polar Bear a bit tougher, of course. \r\nHappy to hear offers. \r\n\r\n[IMG][url=https://flic.kr/p/2nX6RXd][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52475735550_6dcfe20f68_k.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2nX6RXd]IMG_7156[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/190525740@N03/]Philip Golden[/url], on Flickr[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG][url=https://flic.kr/p/2nX6RVK][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52475735465_40e6de16a1_k.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2nX6RVK]IMG_7157[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/190525740@N03/]Philip Golden[/url], on Flickr[/IMG]",
