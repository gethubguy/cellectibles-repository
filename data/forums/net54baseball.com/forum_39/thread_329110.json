      "post_content": "Prices are net to me and delivered. SOLD here or via PM trumps any offers or negotiations. \r\n\r\nPSA 3.5 Warhop $115. A SGC 4 just did $140 on eBay. Super nice card. New flip. \r\n\r\nSGC 2 Ritter with a clean Polar Bear back $75. \r\n\r\nTake both for $170. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52567365432_e6fee81b06_c_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52567827146_e4e0c04514_c_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52567365477_d2f2d2cfb8_c_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52568103384_d9a7b724e4_c_d.jpg[/IMG]",
