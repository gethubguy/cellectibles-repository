      "post_content": "Am looking to trade this Bender portrait beauty for a similarly centered, similar eye appeal Rube Waddell portrait \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure this Bender rates a 2 technically but it compares to others at least a grade or two higher.  Hard to let this one go!\r\n\r\nDepending on specifics, cash available to balance the deal but best deal would be cashless.  Am flexible here.\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\nJeff",
