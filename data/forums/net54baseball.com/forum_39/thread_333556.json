Price is net to me and includes shipping and insurance.  I am also open to trading for Zach Wheat, Bill Dahlen, Clark Griffith or Miller Huggins cards of similar grade.  Due to recent shenanigans I will request references if using PayPal.  Feel free to email me or message on here with any questions.\r\n\r\nCards for sale\r\n\r\n1) George Davis P150 PSA 7 - $3500\r\n2) Hugh Duffy P460/25 PSA 6 - $2200\r\n\r\nIf you take both, 10% discount.\r\n\r\nPaul Curlee\r\n915-449-7623\r\n[url]Paul.curlee1@gmail.com[/url]",
