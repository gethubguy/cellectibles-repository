Only 1 of 2 on the pop reports.  \n\nExcluding the Ty Cobb and Brown Old Mill, Brown Lenox is the rarest of all T206 backs.  Hall of Fame examples of Brown Lenox are super rare.  At one point I was working on a Brown Lenox subset, but I have decided to give up the ghost.   I will list these here for 2-3 days. If they don't sell, I will likely take down the listing and keep or consign.\n\nWill accept wire, check, or PayPal FF.  I will cover shipping. \n\nPM me with questions",
