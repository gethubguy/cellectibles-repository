This is the only example on the pop reports, however, I am almost certain there is one other.  Very few Brown Lenox are graded 3 or above.    \r\n\r\nExcluding the Ty Cobb and Brown Old Mill, Brown Lenox is the rarest of all T206 backs.  Examples of Brown Lenox in this condition are super rare.  At one point, I was working on a Brown Lenox subset, but I have decided to give up the ghost.  I will list these here for 2-3 days. If they don't sell, I will likely take down the listing and keep or consign.\r\n\r\nWill accept wire, check, or PayPal FF.  I will cover shipping. \r\n\r\nPM me with questions",
