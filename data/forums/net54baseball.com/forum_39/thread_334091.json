      "post_content": "T206 Brown Lenox Sam Crawford Batting, PSA 1: $30,000.\r\n\r\nThis card is 100% Brown.  PSA blew the label.  I am certain this is the only example of this front-back combo.  There is another purported brown Lenox in a BVG flip, but I am almost positive that example is black, which would make that the only black lenox example of Crawford batting.  Thus, the example presented here is either the one and only brown or black lenox example, except this card is a 100% very nice brown lenox.\r\n\r\nExcluding the Ty Cobb and Brown Old Mill, Brown Lenox is the rarest of all T206 backs. Hall of Fame examples of Brown Lenox are super rare. At one point I was working on a Brown Lenox subset, but I have decided to give up the ghost. I will list these here for 2-3 days. If they don't sell, I will likely take down the listing and keep or consign.\r\n\r\nWill accept wire, check, or PayPal FF. I will cover shipping.\r\n\r\nPM me with questions",
