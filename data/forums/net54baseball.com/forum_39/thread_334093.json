Examples of Brown Lenox in this condition are super rare. At one point, I was working on a Brown Lenox subset, but I have decided to give up the ghost. I will list these here for 2-3 days. If they don't sell, I will likely take down the listing and keep or consign.\r\n\r\nWill accept wire, check, or PayPal FF. I will cover shipping.\r\n\r\nPM me with questions",
