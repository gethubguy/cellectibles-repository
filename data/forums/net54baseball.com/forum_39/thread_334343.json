      "post_content": "Way before back collecting was in vogue - dad and I bought literally thousands of T206s often searching for tough backs.  In the time we founds almost every possible back \u2026 except for Ty Cobb, Brown Lenox, Drum and BL460.  We had to buy these separately at auctions.   \r\n\r\nFlash forward to 2023 - offered here are two of those extremely tough backs - a trimmed drum and a low grade brown Lenox.  These are duplicates in our back run \u2026 so happy to give another collector a shot.  Please sent inquiries / interest to [url]scottglevy@yahoo.com[/url]",
