I\u2019m specifically looking for one of the following in return, but would entertain any EPDG I don\u2019t have. What I am really in search of though: \r\n\r\nHarry Gasper EPDG\r\nDick Hoblitzell EPDG\r\nMickey Doolin EPDG\r\nRed Dooin EPDG\r\nJack Barry: Tolstoi \r\n\r\nRaw/slabbed doesn\u2019t matter to me. Let\u2019s make a deal. Thanks in advance. \r\n\r\nChris",
