Bad combination. \r\n\r\nI'm considering a number of things but specific to T206 would be very interested in the following:\r\n\r\nTy Cobb Bat On (any common back) in PSA / SGC 1-1.5\r\nTy Cobb Bat Off (any common back) in PSA / SGC 1-1.5\r\nWalter Johnson Hands at Chest in a Sweet Cap 460 series or Tolstoi back in PSA / SGC 1-2 or raw\r\nLenox Back (ideally a New York Giant but open to other teams, player unimportant) in PSA / SGC 1-1.5 or raw\r\nUZIT back (any player / any team) in PSA or SGC 1 or raw\r\nDrum back (any player / any team) in PSA or SGC 1 or raw\r\n\r\nIf you have any of the above and are looking to sell, please let me know.
