      "post_content": "As I'm getting close to the 520 in the all PSA 2 set, I've been looking at the set I've put together and my Elberfeld Washington portrait is not great.  I'd like to upgrade it.  I know it's not a cheap card and I'm looking to pay a fair price for one (read, I don't need the deal of the century or even the deal of the day).\r\n\r\nIf you have a PSA 2 only (no half grades, qualifiers or other grading companies), please PM me with a price.  I'll likely ask you to email me a photo of it as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!  I'm just over 500 into the all PSA 2 set so getting a better example of the 2 I have would be great!\r\n\r\nTRambo",
