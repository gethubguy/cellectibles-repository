You can actually see this card in the first picture in this Reddit posting [URL=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/r54sgl/a_consignor_dropped_off_a_nearcomplete_t206_set/\"]https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/r54sgl/a_consignor_dropped_off_a_nearcomplete_t206_set/[/URL].\r\n\r\nSam is a little rough on the front with a creases and slight paper loss. Certainly a lower-end card, but still a decent example of the legendary HoF Detroit Tiger.\r\n\r\nCard has sold.  Thanks!",
