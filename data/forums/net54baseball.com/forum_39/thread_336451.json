      "post_content": "FS: T206 Walter Johnson Hands at Chest SGC 1.5 - Polar Bear. Has some very minor tobacco staining on bottom and a hard to notice wrinkle near his mouth. Main reason for the grade being a 1.5 is the miscut Polar Bear back, as two backs are visible. \n\n$1350 delivered no fee\n\n\n [IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230609/5aaac50809ca1d1bf10b9ad1ba60643e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230609/b8c477b158864497ac07e2c40886f4be.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230609/045a1cb8174f90d988aeca591b46ba3f.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
