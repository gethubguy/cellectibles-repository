      "post_content": "The recent Tolstoi postings made me take a look at my collection and I found a Ganzel. I've owned him since 1980 or earlier.  Clean, has a nice gloss, no creases. Just some sort of dirt or something.\r\n\r\nLooks like PSA has graded 2, SGC, 3.\r\n\r\n$1800ppd.  Please see high res images below (600dpi) and pm if interested. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\nETA: Added a photo from my cell phone to show the color is more vibrant than the scans.  (Not loving my new Epson v600).",
