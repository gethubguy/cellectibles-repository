      "post_content": "Last card I am selling or trading from a collection I bought last year. Was glued in an album but soaked off with VERY little paper loss, only a speck on reverse at bottom. Technical grade would be a 1-1.5 but great looking card if you need one.\n\nOpen to trading for essentially anything. I have no attachment to the card. \n\nVintage football, basketball, baseball. Another t206, or 33 Goudey HOFer in low grade. If you want the card throw something out there in the $50-100 range.
