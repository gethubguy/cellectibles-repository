Given the volume, in an effort to minimize back and forth, I am looking to pay the price from the PSA guide (path at bottom). If you have cards that fit the criteria, assuming I don't already have that card, I am willing buy it/them off of you at the price listed below.\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/priceguide/b...te-border/1055[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTaylor",
