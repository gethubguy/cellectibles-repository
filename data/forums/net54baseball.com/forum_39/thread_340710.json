This one has better eye appeal. Unfortunately the tape on the back caused SGC to deem it a 1. I would really appreciate to hear what others think the actual value of this card is. Thanks for looking and I look forward to hearing everyone\u2019s opinions on this one.",

The tape may well be able to be removed without damage to the back but even if not it is worth more than $3K IMO because the front displays very nicely.",
