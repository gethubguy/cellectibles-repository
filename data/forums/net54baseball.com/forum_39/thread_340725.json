      "post_content": "Hi all- I'm looking for certain T206 commons (non HOF), thought I'd ask:)\r\n\r\n Specifically, Magee portrait or Bat, Kling portrait, Lobert portrait, Oberlin, \r\n Pattee, Powers, Burch Batting, Durham, Beaumont portrait.\r\n\r\n What is important-\r\n\r\n 1) Nice looking example for the assigned grade\r\n\r\n 2) No trimmed or altered cards\r\n\r\n 3) Graded or raw both fine. Looking for cards in \"3\" to \"5\" range.\r\n\r\n Not important-\r\n\r\n 1) Card back. Pied or SCap are just fine, other backs great of course.\r\n\r\n If anyone is willing to part with any of these, please PM. Thanks!\r\n\r\n Trent King",
