      "post_content": "Offered here are two very nice T206's. The first is Stanage the 2nd Cambell. The Stanage is graded a 5.5 by BVG Beckett and the Campbell is a t. They are both crease free and look incredible. They are new to the hobby as they come from a collection put together in the 1980s or earlier. They were submitted for grading by the person I acquired them from. Both have nice Piedmont 350 backs. Both cards have excellent centering, clarity, color and registration with nice wide white borders as well. Great crease free cards. I don't guarantee they will cross to PSA or SGC but think they are graded conservatively.  I apologize for the cell phone images but my scanners makes them look blurry and these Beckett holders are quite thick. Please add 5.99 shipping with tracking for one or both\n\nStanage 200.00 Net\nMcBride Sold\nCampbell Sold",
