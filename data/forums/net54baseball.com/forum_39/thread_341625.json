      "post_content": "This November I am wanting to buy a selection of Reds and Phillies with specific backs, and right now I am trying to get a sense of what might be available so I can prioritize, as I will not have the funds to purchase everything I want! Below is what I am looking for - my budget will require lower grades, in the 1-2 range. If you have anything you'd be open to selling in November, please send me a DM.
