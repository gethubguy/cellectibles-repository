Beautiful 150 series color and image. Last 2 was a PSA that did $5300 a few days back. It had paper loss on the front.\r\n\r\n$4500\r\n\r\n***SOLD***\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53275906660_d4f394baca_c_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53275792864_a52f69f642_c_d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53274546052_1eb4f40ae1_c_d.jpg[/IMG]",
