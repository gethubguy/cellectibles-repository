      "post_content": "Craig,\r\n\r\nThese double Factory numbers are neat; wish I had collected them.\r\n\r\nCan we assume that the printers missed their mark with the overprint design, i.e., that it should have covered the \u201cFactory 30\u201d line?\r\n\r\nAnd, consequently, that it only happened to a limited number of sheets, featuring these 28 subjects?\r\n\r\nI wonder if this subset could fit into any of the hypotheses on uncut sheet sizes?\r\n\r\nDid Ron do an article on them, and if so can you provide the link?  Thanks.",

I found this one later, sent it to PSA and sure enough, came back hand cut.  I've sold it since then, but it was cool to know these are still out there to be had.",
