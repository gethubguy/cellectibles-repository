      "post_content": "Not sure if this is the exact year that held cards. Value is in the Sovereign Cigarette Pack (has that great 100+ yr old smell).  Including the T206 Sovereign Karger for free (beater, missing most of the back). Hard to price..based off Piedmont pack comps, start it at SOLD Or Best Offer. \r\nPlease note, no cigarettes plus a small price of tape holding the top lid in place.\r\nThanks for Looking,\r\n-Ryan",
