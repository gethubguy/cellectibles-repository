Which is why I\u2019m selling as a cheap lot. \r\n\r\nShipping is from the UK and I will use Royal Mail International, fully tracked and insured. I have an eBay account (jpwinn1511) with 100% feedback with over 600 sales and have sold a couple of times on here a couple of years ago. \r\n\r\nI would like $750 net to me. This price includes shipping. \r\n\r\nPayment by PayPal F&F or G&S plus 4%.\r\n\r\nI can send additional pictures if anybody would like.",
