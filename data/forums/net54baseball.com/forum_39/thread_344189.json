Not sure \r\nI am willing to spend for an exhaustive set, but would like at least get 10 or so.\r\n\r\nCurrent needs:\r\n\r\nPolar Bear\r\nSweet Cap (any)\r\nAmerican Beauty\r\nTolstoi\r\n\r\nNot a high roller, so probably can't afford more than a 2-3 condition. Feel free to hit me up. If you do have some of the rarer backs (Broadleaf, Hindu,etc) you are welcome to open a discussion as well.",
