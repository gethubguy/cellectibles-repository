      "post_content": "these cards will be sold.  Toward that end, the prices listed will be randomly changed, usually downward, but not always.  Price changes will not be announced when made.  You have to keep checking.  New prices will be in effect for at least 24 hours.  If you are interested in a specific card, let me know and make an offer if you choose.  That card will not be sold for less than your offer going forward.  I may just ask you to make your payment.  Current prices will be in the original post colored red, next to the original asking price.  \nIf you have any questions regarding this format, let me know.  \n\nThe thread will not be bumped by me for serial \"price cuts\", but at least one price will be changed daily.  You have to look.",
