      "post_content": "These 2 Cobbs are amongst the very best per grade NO CREASES AND NO ROUNDED CORNERS .I will get pictures later, I dont have a scanner and am not sure if phone pictures do any justice both the GREAT RED COLOR that is sought after for looks and no creases once again, both were set to go top 5 % I didnt initially understand why to do that.\n\nOne is Old Mill and the other I believe is 350-460 Piedmont. They will be priced at 6900.00 each or maybe 13k for both. Id keep either one. Both of these look minimally a PSA 4 but small back of card issues bring them down a little a wee bit of paper loss on back of the Old Mill and the back of the Piedmont looks slightly dirty but exceptionally beautiful cards. References on how I purchase is in asking Leon, Tony Andrea or Thomas Church. I buy the card and NO ROUNDED CORNERS EVER.\n\nOLD MILL IS PICTURED BELOW",
