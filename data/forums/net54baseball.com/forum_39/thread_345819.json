      "post_content": "Upgraded my green Cobb so I would like to sell or trade my PSA 1. In my opinion it is nice for the grade (I know everyone says this). Looking for $3650.00 via no fee payment and that price is firm. I would consider trades for caramel Wagners, Planks or other Cobbs tobacco or caramel. If interested, PM me an email or phone number and I will get you pictures. This is cross posted on some of the FB tobacco/T206 groups. Thanks for looking.",
