My preference is *cheap* -- as in gently worn, ungraded, standard backs (even with paper loss). But I'll look at anything.\r\n\r\nIs anyone looking to move any of the following (mostly) commons?\r\n\r\n  * Ames (Hands At Chest)\r\n  * Ames (Hands Above Head)\r\n  * Ames (Portrait)\r\n  * Bridwell (Portrait -- No Cap)\r\n  * Donlin (With Bat)\r\n  * Doyle, Larry (Throwing)\r\n  * Doyle, Larry (With Bat)\r\n  * Durham\r\n  * Marquard (Pitching) [HOF, obviously]\r\n  * McCormick\r\n  * Murray (Batting)\r\n  * Tenney\r\n\r\n\r\nWilling to pay PPGS. Thank you in advance! -- Rick",
