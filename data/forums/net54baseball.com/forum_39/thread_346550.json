Constantly coming across large lots of 20 plus cards. \r\n\r\nI'm now 357/520 and things seem to be slowing down. \r\n\r\nUsing a pop report from PSA/SGC compiled by another user here on Net54 , I have concentrated my buying power on the top 100 cards (82/100) and now that has gotten slow I have turned to the 101-200 list. \r\n\r\nGood luck on the Binder build.  \r\nI have about a dozen doubles I'm looking to trade. \r\n\r\nHit me up if interested. \r\n\r\nBilly",
