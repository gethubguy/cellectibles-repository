Message or email at the address below.\r\n\r\nMy trading stock is a little thin at this point as I\u2019m just starting back, but figured I would start at the beginning with the American Beauty 460.\r\n\r\nHere are the duplicate fronts I have that I can add in as trade help, if you like:\r\n\r\nBender Port SGC 2.5 GD+\r\nClarke Port SC 150/30 SGC 2.5 GD+\r\nTolstoi McGraw with Cap SGC 1.5\r\n(Let\u2019s see if iPad pics load)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBob\r\n[url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
