      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following lot of T206 cards for sale. These are all low to mid-grade cards, ranging from poor to VG/EX, as the scans will show.\n\n*NOTE* My scanner does not work well with graded cards, so if you would like better pics of any of the graded ones, I can send those to you separately.\n\nPlease add $4 shipping (USPS Ground Advantage which includes $100 insurance) for 1-2 cards. For 3 or more, I will cover shipping. Prices listed are net to me, via any payment method you prefer.\n\nPlease send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!\n\nCARDS PICTURED (removing SOLD cards from list for easier viewing):\n\nBescher (print anomaly with missing ink spot on left side) - $50\nCollins - $275\nEvers - $200\nFreeman - (Sweet Caporal 350/25...tough combo) $50\nKleinow - $100\nMiller - $110",
