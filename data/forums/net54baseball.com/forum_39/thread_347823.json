      "post_content": "Hi All,\n\nI am working on a new art installation for my office that I am hoping can combine my interests in art and t206 collecting. I do not have much of a collecting appetite for the chewed up, half-card pieces that some people have in their possession, but I do still think the artwork is unique and can be displayed in a way that can be appreciated, regardless of condition. \n\nThat being said, I am looking to buy whatever torn up, chopped up, hole punched, ugly tobacco cards you may have lying around (for a reasonable price). While torn up is a plus, I would still like to look at cards with relatively bold colors if possible. If the card is particularly worthless, I will also gladly accept donations of any kind as well. \n\nThe goal is to create some sort of abstract, 3D paper collage installation that can be hung in our office lobby. Still working out the design details, but I wanted to provide a disclaimer: However the cards are displayed, they will not be glued or applied with any other adhesive (I want to protect the integrity of the card, regardless of how torn up it already is). \n\nExcited to see where this project goes - appreciate anyone willing to help out!\n\nalso, if anyone has this card, happy to make it the centerpiece of the display. \n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=616088&d=1711651437[/IMG]",

I think this will give my efforts a little more focus and give me a better chance of creating something that is actually visually appealing. The 2nd photo is the cards I have obtained so far. Starting to see a color palette take shape. I am still looking to buy (especially red and yellow beaters) and will of course accept donations for those so inclined.
