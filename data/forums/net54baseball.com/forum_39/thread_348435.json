      "post_content": "Hello. I have the following T206 card for sale.  Frequently named as the toughest SL in the set.  This one is a lower grade but decent looking example with an unusual slightly diagonally miscut back showing a small part of the neighboring card back in the top left corner.  Interesting print anomaly that I haven't seen before!\r\n\r\nCard is SOLD.  Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nPlease send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase any cards or with any questions. Thanks for looking!",
