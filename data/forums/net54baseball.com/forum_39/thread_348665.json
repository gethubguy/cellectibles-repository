Poland in any back and SL'er Ray Ryan preferably in an Old Mill.  The other 3 are Green Cobb, Demmitt and O'Hara (St Louis) and I honestly don't have the funds for any of those 3 just yet.\r\n\r\nCondition for Poland and Ryan would ideally be between PR to VG...raw or graded, I'm fine with either...\r\n\r\nPM me if you have any you are willing to sell.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the help!\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\n\r\nJT",
