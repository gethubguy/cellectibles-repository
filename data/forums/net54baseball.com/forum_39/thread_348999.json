I need both the Sweet Cap 350/460 Factory 30 and Factory 42 (not the overprint). Looking for graded VG or VGEX HOFers.  I\u2019ve got some things for trade or might be able to swap player for player if I already have him as a front (and toss in a couple $ for helping me).\r\n\r\nLet me know if anyone has anything they could pass along to help me out.\r\n\r\nThanks and any help appreciated,\r\nBob\r\nPM or email at upperhandisforemost @ yahoo.com \r\n(let\u2019s see if those spaces in the email keep the ones moving their uncle\u2019s brother\u2019s son\u2019s cards)",
