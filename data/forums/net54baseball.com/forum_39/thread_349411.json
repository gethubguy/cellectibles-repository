      "post_content": "It took me 30 years to collect this set (520 cards - not including \"The Big Four\"), and I have enjoyed having the complete set for the past 4 years. It has been sitting in a safe deposit box for a while, and I am considering selling it, so someone else can enjoy it. I have painstakingly used several methods to track and update pricing of all 520 cards in an excel spreadsheet (using this site, Beckett, Tuff Stuff, PSA, and more), and it has an estimated value of $45,000.00-$48,000.00, based on the condition of the cards (about 30 are graded, including HOF'ers).\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to sell this, so I can get the most $ for it? I know auction houses/companies can take quite a bit of commission. \r\n\r\nAny legitimate, helpful answers will be considered.",

      "post_content": "You will clearly get the most cash by consigning to a major auction house. You will be able to get a favorable consignment rate of zero for a consignment of this value so you would get the hammer price. Some houses would even give a small portion of the buyer premium for a $50K consignment.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that selling as a set will yield the most because there are plenty of collectors who do not have the patience to put a set together but would pay more for a complete set minus the big 4 and would pay more for not having to put forth any effort other than spending cash. But, the auction houses may have other opinions depending on condition of the better HOFers.\r\n\r\nSets rarely come up for auction and are usually pieced out so selling a complete set would be an oddity.\r\n\r\nBased on your valuation, the set has to be in lower grade condition. If the Cobbs, Mathewsons, Youngs, Johnsons, and the other key cards are graded higher than 1 or 2, then breaking the set might make sense. \r\n\r\nEven on Ebay, you are giving up 12.35% of the hammer so using an auction house with no fees easily surpasses selling it yourself on Ebay with no effort required on your part.\r\n\r\nJust one opinion of course. I'm sure there will be plenty of dissenters.",

      "post_content": "I can't see a better way of selling than posting a big list with higher end comps (or even more expensive based on rarity) each card Individually. There's just no conceivable way I can see them doing better as a 520 card lot. \n\nIf a Cobb goes for $5000 that you have, selling it for $5000 is far better than selling the 520 card lot and the Cobb coming out to an estimated price of $4200. That's my mindset at least. And can be applied to them all imo. Eye appeal is also huge (obviously) if you see a recent sale of a same grade lajoie for $400 and it has a small crease or something and yours looks just as good with no crease  you could easily ask for several hundred more. These kinds of things just aren't taken into account when you're talking about 520 card lots. And the numbers can really add up. It's just a lot of work and a ton of typing. Which it seems like you already did a good bit of. People will value the time it takes heading to the post office once vs 300 times and a single payment far more and happily take $5000 (or whatever the number may be) less. It's just what suits you, just my thoughts.",

Around 120 are currently in slabs, according to my spreadsheet.",
