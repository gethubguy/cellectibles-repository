      "post_content": "Have a very nice PSA 1.5 Cobb bat on that I would like to trade for a similar condition bat off or red port., WaJo port., off back Cubbies (Chance, Brown, Tinker, Kling, Steinfeldt, Overall\u2026.etc.). Card is one of the nicest 1.5\u2019s I\u2019ve seen. Has a spot of tape residue on the back, and if it weren\u2019t for that it would\u2019ve graded much higher. PWCC \u201cA\u201d for those of you that that appeals to. If interested, please PM me and I\u2019ll email or text pics. Also willing to sell outright for 3.1k.",
