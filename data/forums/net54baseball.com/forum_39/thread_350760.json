      "post_content": "Yes, it is raw.... \r\n\r\nI bought most of my T206 cards back in the early-mid 90s, and have never submitted them for grading. This would be an excellent candidate for grading, if so desired.  It should grade at least a \"6\".  \r\n\r\nSharp corners, perfect edges, beautiful centering and great registration... not to mention those beautiful pastel colors.  \r\n\r\nAsking $339 OBO  After looking at what's available on eBay (and the lack of anything in this grade), I feel this price is a steal.  But am happy to entertain offers from whoever is interested.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
