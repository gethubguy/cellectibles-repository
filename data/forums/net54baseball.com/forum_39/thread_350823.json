      "post_content": "Hi everyone.  Getting back into the hobby here and new to the forum.  I\u2019m focusing on T206 Piedmont backs that are 5 range and higher (or raw in Ex or higher).  As far as grading company, I\u2019m open.  If it\u2019s a more obscure grading company and the card is obviously altered, I\u2019m not interested :D\r\n\r\nAnyhow, if you have any cards that fit the bill, feel free to contact me.  I have a high eBay rating that I can use as a reference if necessary since I\u2019m new here.",
