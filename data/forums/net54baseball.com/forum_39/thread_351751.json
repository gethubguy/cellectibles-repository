      "post_content": "First post, hopefully I\u2019m doing this right. Want to trade FOR my first Cobb, preferably a low grade that presents well. Mainly interest in Bat Off or either Portrait. I generally collect lower grade cards that punch above their technical grade, looking for the same here\r\n\r\nWhat I have to trade:\r\n1953 Topps Mickey Mantle SGC 2 (dead centered)\r\n1956 Jackie Robinson PSA 6 (centered)\r\nT206 Walter Johnson Hands At Chest SGC 2.5\r\nT206 Cy Young Glove Showing BVG 4\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to make a deal without having to trade the few T206\u2019s I have but for the right deal I\u2019d do it. Don\u2019t have any vouches on here given that I\u2019m new but I do from other sites, or I\u2019m happy to do the trade through Veriswap. Thanks!",
