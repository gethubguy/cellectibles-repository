      "post_content": "Guys,\r\n\r\nAfter much thought I have decided to part with my entire set. I'm going to price them reasonably as this is a low grade set. Most cards are between 2-3 with a couple higher grades in the mix. \r\n\r\nI'll be posting pictures here shortly. I have come to terms with the fact this is not as nice of a set as i thought it was and am lowering my asking price for set to $49,500. I will entertain offers so price is not set in stone. Most cards are raw. The major stars like cobb are in tough shape but are graded. Both batt on shoulder and off shoulder cobbs have now been sold\r\n\r\nThanks for looking. Send me a PM here if you are interested. Final price drop before sending to auction.",
