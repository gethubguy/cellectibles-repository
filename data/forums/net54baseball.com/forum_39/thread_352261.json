      "post_content": "Hello, I\u2019m interested in adding these stamp types to my collection of back stamps. I know these tattoo-transfers and purple numbers are somewhat tough to come by, but please let me know if you have any you\u2019d be open to selling or trading. If interested I have several T206s to trade, some that have unique characteristics i.e. back stamps, missing color, wet sheet transfers, etc. Thanks!",
