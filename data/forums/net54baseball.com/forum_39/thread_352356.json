Paypal please for payment. \r\n\r\nIf you notice a slight irregularity with the cases between cards #1 and #2, I edited out the fourth card in the middle that sold already. Cards were photographed on an angle to avoid glare, so it was tough to cleanly edit out a specific card\r\n\r\nPSA 1.5 - $55\r\n2.5 - $80\r\n3.5 - $115\r\n\r\nA PSA 2.5 Thielman auction just ended for $115 shipped (plus tax) on Ebay nine days ago",
