Back on the market now, as he doesn\u2019t go with the HOFer backs run.\r\n\r\nLooking to sell or maybe trade this Elite 11 Germany Schaefer Piedmont 350. I\u2019m not sure what to price it, heard a couple of 5\u2019s sold around 3k and 5k at the peak. Was thinking about rolling the dice and sending it to auction for fun, but would rather keep it in our community if possible.\r\n\r\nSOLD\r\n\r\nWould trade for T213 HOFer..\r\n\r\nLet me know if any interest,\r\nBob\r\nPM or email to [url]upperhandisforemost@yahoo.com[/url]",
