      "post_content": "Hey all,\r\nTrying to line things up in the HOF backs line. I\u2019m trying to fill the Polar Bear spot with one of the 350 only HOFers. Struggling to get all the 150/350 and 350 only guys in spots without to much duplication of backs. I\u2019ve already checked these guys with P350 backs, but looking to use one of the HOFers in the Polar Bear spot.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anyone would be looking to move either of these guys. I could buy or might have some trade you need.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBob\r\nPM me if you can help.",
