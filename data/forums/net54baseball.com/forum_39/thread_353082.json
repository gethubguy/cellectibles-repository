      "post_content": "Hi everyone.  I am selling my T206 Green Ty Cobb.  It has that amazing deep green coloring that is hard to find on these.  The registration and centering are also very nice.  Wonderful eye appeal for the grade.  \n\nAsking $7500 delivered.  Feel free to reach out to me with any questions.  I am a full time watch dealer in Hopkinton NH and happy to meet in person to do a deal.  Also on many facebook groups.  \n\nThanks!\n\nLarry Cohen\n[url]secondhandwatches7@gmail.com[/url]\n6104202849\nIG @second.hand.watches",
