      "post_content": "Hello. I have the below pictured T206 Cy Young (glove shows) for sale. As you can see from the scans, the card is graded PSA 1, but I think could easily bump up a grade, as the only real flaw aside from the rounded corners is a very small wrinkle and paper scuff near the top left corner.  It is also well centered with very large borders all around.  Quite nice overall for the grade!\r\n\r\nPrice is $1150 (net to me) delivered via any payment you prefer.\r\n\r\n**CARD IS SOLD**\r\n\r\nPlease send me a PM or e-mail to [url]marcdelpercio2000@yahoo.com[/url] to purchase or with any questions. Thanks for looking!",
