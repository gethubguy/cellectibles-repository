I have seen the quality of the T206 cards here sorta diminish & the prices usually similar to Ebay. So thanks for a fresh look. Also many are going SGC which surprises me of the veterans that I have encountered here.\r\n\r\nBut back to the cards... I am interested in other cards if you have or compile them in the 5-6 PSA grades(a few 4's, less than 10)... but my back focus is the Sweet Caporal's if that comes your way.\r\nAgain, congrats.\r\n-Tracy Snider\r\n[url]tracy@sniderinsurance.com[/url]",
