Most people would go that route rather than eBay.\n\nBut looks like it turned out to be real so buyer got lucky for sure.",

      "post_content": "Funny story, I literally just received two T206s a couple days ago in the exact GAI slabs they are talking about. The slab just pops right open. I\u2019m a newer collector so I\u2019m nowhere close to being an expert but as far as I can tell (and smell) the cards are real and I\u2019m not real sure why someone would try and fake a $50 t206 common so I guess I\u2019m just confused as to why someone would go through all of the trouble to put a real card in a fake slab. Maybe to portray it as a higher grade than what it really is? But again, these cards are commons that I bought for $50 each so I\u2019m just not understanding I guess. \n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
