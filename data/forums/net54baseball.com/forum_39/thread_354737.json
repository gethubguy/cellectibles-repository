      "post_content": "This one has beautiful colors (deeper green than photos show) and really nice image quality front and back. O/C top to bottom as usual. Corners actually quite nice for a 3.5 except for top left which shows obvious wear. No wrinkles, nothing hidden - $SOLD including express delivery or 3% discount for Zelle/FF/check. \n\nNew seller to here - member for past 18 months - and have purchased items from a few of you before. Just selling off a part of my collection as I have a slightly different focus now (changes often). eBay user ID is megalodonteeth so you can see feedback. Thanks for looking - Steve",
