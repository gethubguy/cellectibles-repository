Looking to move this Matty portrait, as i was able to replace it in the backs line. I needed the P350 slot for one of the 350 Only HOFers.\r\n\r\nTwo surface wrinkles on his left shoulder and a little dirt spot on his forehead.\r\n\r\nMatty Port TRADED\r\nTinker Knees $$$0LD\r\n\r\nI would consider P42 HOFers or a T213-1 HOFer in trade, but cash buyer would have rights to it if trade isn\u2019t finalized beforehand.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone is enjoying the weekend,\r\nBob\r\n\r\nShoot me a PM if interested",
