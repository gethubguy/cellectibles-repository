      "post_content": "Recently , I have been working filling the gaps in my T206 collection and came upon one I need for sale. Price is right, etc, and it is even in an  SGC slab. I buy mostly raw, and have been working on this set for 30 plus years, but something about this card gives me pause. I asked the seller for clearer pictures, which they did no problem. Aside from the ink stain on the back and left side of the card, and that is offset , not centered, the card seems remarkably clean. After reading several posts here , I just want to make sure before I purchase this, so any thoughts or guidance will be appreciated. I\u2019m not saying the card isn\u2019t authentic, but I thought I\u2019d ask here. The border to me seems very white , again, let me know and thank you! Sorry about the blurry back photos, that\u2019s all I have on that.\r\nSORRY, I MEANT THIS GO IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AND DON\u2019T KNOW HOW TO MOVE IT OR DELETE\u2026..SORRY",

Bought the card , it is the last McGraw I needed in the T206 set.\r\nThank you for your input, this is the greatest collector site around as the members are willing to help and guide folks. Pretty awesome!",
