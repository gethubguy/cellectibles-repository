      "post_content": "Have this small group of name on tops available. Harder to price these so I'm going based on recent other examples. \n\n$165 JJ Clarke with Weimer name on top\nSOLD  $135 Purtell with full name on top\nPENDING  $95 Peaches Graham with half name on top...big borders \n\nAvailable via PM. As always, will consider offers....but anyway saying \"I'll take it\" gets priority over negotiations.\n\nThanks!\nJeff\n\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2qLHVxJ][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54327360524_a08d276a64_c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2qLCaky][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54326236242_8922341aae_c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2qLHVaZ][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54327359263_46283dc580_z.jpg[/img][/url]",
