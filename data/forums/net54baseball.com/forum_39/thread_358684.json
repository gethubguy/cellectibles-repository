      "post_content": "Looking to move my Gandil American Beauty 350. It\u2019s in a PSA 2(mk) slab with a tiny bit of light pencil mark on the back. Pretty nice overall and a tough back on a popular player. I suck at posting pics, so if interested shoot me a PM and I\u2019ll email or text you all the pics you want. $OLD NET\u2026.price is firm for now, or happy to discuss trades for T206 Cubs that I do not have.",
