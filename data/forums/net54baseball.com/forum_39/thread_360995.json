At the end of the list are images of a couple of the cards listed if you want to know what the stamp looks like. As always, thanks to so many Net54 members who have gotten me to this point of rebuilding a complete set, if Howe had one.\n\nRed Ames (Hands above Head)\nJack Bastian*\nJake Beckley\nGeorge Bell (Pitching Follow Through)*\nChief Bender (Pitching, No Trees in Background)\nBill Bradley (with bat)\nAl Bridwell (Portrait, With Cap)\nGeorge Browne (Washington)\nMordecai Brown (Chicago on Shirt)\nCharley Carr*\nHal Chase (Holding Trophy)\nHal Chase (Portrait, Blue Background)\nTy Cobb (Portrait, Green Background)*\nTy Cobb (Portrait, Red Background)*\nTy Cobb (Bat of Shoulder)*\nTy Cobb (Bat on Shoulder)*\nSam Crawford (Throwing)\nSam Crawford (With Bat)\nDode Criss*\nBill Dahlen (Brooklyn)\nHarry Davis (Davis on Front)\nJosh Devore\nMike Donlin (With Bat)\nWild Bill Donovan (throwing)\nMickey Doolan (Batting)\nPatsy Dougherty (Arm in Air)\nTom Downey (Batting)\nJoe Doyle (N.Y.

But instead, trying to make a complete set has turned out to be an even better adventure. Thanks, Paul M. for the idea. \r\n\r\nSince Scott broke up the huge lot, this card (and one other on its way from earlier in the week) brings the number of cards in that 975 card lot that I didn\u2019t have an example of down to just 10 now. I know who owns four of them, and after an initial exchange of emails two years ago, he has chosen not to respond to any communications. I\u2019ll just hope there is at least one other example of those four cards that I can find. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to everyone. I\u2019ll keep posting new ones in the monthly pick-up threads and updating the list here as they are found.",
