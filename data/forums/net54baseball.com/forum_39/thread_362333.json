Of the \"Big 4\" it was the only one still attainable for a plebe like me, especially in light of a Wagner now selling for $3M+.\r\n\r\nGraded AUTH, but it presents much nicer than most 1s/AUTHs that look like they've passed through a dog's GI tract.\r\n\r\n$9000 postpaid in the conus via USPS Registered Mail.  Payment must be through personal/bank check or ppff from established members only.  A commitment to purchase outweighs any ongoing discussions, especially from established members.  I can provide a mountain of references from my 15 year history here on net54 and a history with every auction house under the sun.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a PM with interest.  \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]",
