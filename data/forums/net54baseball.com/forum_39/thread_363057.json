If you see one you are interested in shoot me a PM and I can give you a number. \r\n\r\nOnly the Piedmont & Sweet Caps are available. The off backs are not outside of the Sov 150 SGC 1.5. I'd be willing to sell that one. \r\n\r\nPSA 4 cert #41087154 has been sold.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nScott\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/171415994@N04/albums/72177720312275846/with/53324800307[/url]",
