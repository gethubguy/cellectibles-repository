      "post_content": "Hey Guys,\n\nI posted this tintype on the main forum not too long ago. As you can see from the scan, this tintype is in incredible condition. The image is extremely dark and clear without any oxidation or other visual blemishes. The tintype featuers two players who I think may be on opposing teams. One gentlemen is leaning on a bat and the other is holding a baseball in his open hand. The original paper frame is fully in tact without any tears or stains. I can get a back scan to whoever would like to see one. I have an idea of what I would like to get for the tintype, but will hear any and all offers. If you're interested shoot me an e-mail with an offer and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. \n\ne-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[img]http://s107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/tintype.jpg[/img]",
