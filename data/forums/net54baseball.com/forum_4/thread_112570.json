It would seem that the R&S baseball cards are actually published by Raphael Tuck & Sons, who did all sorts of similar \"scraps\" or \"oblaten\", as well as postcards, greeting cards, and other ephemera.\n\nI am working my way through a scrapbook from 1891, and among some of the baseball cards from R&S (sic) are two boxers, both Heavyweights. Anyone ever seen these little guys?\n\nThanks,\n\nLaura\n\n[IMG]http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr56/KatyDidsCards/Heavya.jpg[/IMG]",
