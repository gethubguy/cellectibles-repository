Both of these cities did have several teams per city at this time frame.  No rosters could be found though for them.  They were class A, B, and C teams.  Could this bring in $475.  I have already spoke with another person and they gave me their thoughts about it.  I am just wondering if this carries a value over $100 mark. Thanks to all for your time and help.",
