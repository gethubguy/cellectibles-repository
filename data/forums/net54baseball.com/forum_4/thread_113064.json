      "post_content": "Looking for an affordable and presentable N162 baseball player card.  I welcome pinholes or major backside paper loss -- just so long as the card is in one piece and the player's face is in good shape I'm interested.  \n\nI can pay via any method.  Please post or email me at [url]jarharrington@yahoo.com[/url].  Thanks!",
