      "post_content": "NOW on eBay (BIN w/ Best offer option)-  SGC 60/5 JACK CLEMENTS -- Greatest Left-Handed Catcher Ever (Catchers Are Never Lefties!) He was also the first player to catch over a 1,000 major league games.  He was very durable and a much better hitter than his even more durable catching contemporary, Deacon McGuire. Clement's home run records (single-season and career) lasted until Gabby Hartnett broke them. \n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Clements[/url]\n\n$225 SGC 20/1.5 CHARLIE BUFFINGTON (Buffinton) -- nice image chipping on one corner and scrapbook removal account for the lower grade.  \"Buffinton\" (his name according to Baseball reference if not Goodwin & Co. or SGC) played 9 full seasons and parts of 2 seasons and ended his career with a 233 -152  record (winning % .605). He went 48-16 in 1884 with a 2.15 ERA, a tremendous season that -- nonetheless -- paled by comparison to Hoss Radbourn's 59-12 1.38. \nYou could look it up:\n[url]http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buffich01.shtml[/url]\n\nPrices include shipping & insurance -- the first to contact me at bhodes@rcn.com accepting these terms gets the card(s)\n\nPaypal is accepted without any surcharge.",
