      "post_content": "SGC 40 -  N172 DEACON McGUIRE.\nMcGuire was among the most durable players of all-time.  McGuire's playing career lasted from 1884-1912.  He longevity is especially remarkable because he played catcher with  little if any of the protective gear we now associate with position.  McGuire held the record for games caught from 1899 until 1925 when future Hall of Famer Ray Schalk surpassed his totals.  McGuire's record for career assists  by a Catcher still stands.\nNice strong image of the enduring Catcher in a crouch (without a glove or any of the tools ignorance).\n--> NOW on eBay (BIN w/ best offer option)\n\nSGC 50 -  N172 James \"Grasshopper\" Whitney ...  Not the famous pose with a dog.  Whitney was one of the top strikeout pitchers and one of the top hitting pitchers of the 19th century. His consistently high strikeout numbers , low walk figures and low ERA placed him among the leaders throughout his brief career.  Unlike his contemporaries Radborne, Keefe, Welch and Galvin, Whitney was seldom on a winner and failed to put up their career Win numbers (300+).  His career percentage for walks/Strikeouts is 6th all-time, well-ahead of his HOF contemporaries.  \nNice throwing image of the hurler... but no dog.\n--> NOW on eBay (Auction - NO Reserve )\n\nFirst to contact me at bhodes@rcn.com accepting these terms gets the cards -- PayPal accepted without any additional charge.",
