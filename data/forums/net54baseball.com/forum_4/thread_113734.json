      "post_content": "I have a rare N154 1890 Duke's Tobacco Presidential Baseball Club card. These cards are very hard to come by. Card is of Benjamin Harrison. This card has some issues as you can tell by the scans but overall has nice eye appeal. Does have a tear in the upper right corner. Don't know if it shows in the scan. I recently submitted the card to SGC and they did not grade due to it being skinned. I will include their documentation of the card also. Any questions, please email me [url]david.goff@insightbb.com[/url]\n\nSOLD. Price includes shipping and DC/insurance. I take PayPal, money orders, or checks.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/makersmarkambassador/nonsporttobacoocards/nonsports/N154%20Benjamin%20Harrison.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/makersmarkambassador/nonsporttobacoocards/nonsports/n154%20harrison%20back.jpg[/IMG]",
