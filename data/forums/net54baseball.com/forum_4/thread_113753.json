      "post_content": "Very Rare and highly sought after Old Judge Subject:\n Jim McCormick -- a stellar Pitcher whose 9.5 year career ended in 1887 at age 30.. He had a career record of 265-214 and was one of the top pitchers in the league for some of these years.\nGraded SGC 70 / 5.5  (EX+)  A relatively high grade and a nice fairly clear image.\n\nI can't seem to find any  prior sales results for this card (not that unusal for OJs) and I don't recall when I bought this one or how much I paid although I'm fairly confident that I bought it raw.   The closest I can find (and the only one in the past 3 yrs) is from the  most recent REA (5/3/09)   Auction   $4,406.25 which was different more difficult pose (Chic-Portrait) (310b)  at a significantly lower grade, SGC 20... There was another lower grade McCormick OJ card sold in Dec. of 05 in a different pose that went for $546.\nMOVED TO EBAY (BIN W/ BEST OFFERS option)",
