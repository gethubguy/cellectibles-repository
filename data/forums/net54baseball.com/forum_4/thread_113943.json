      "post_content": "I have this 1880's (probably about 1885 or so) unidentified Baseball team cabinet photo.  It is almost certainly a professional team but the league and year are lost to history (minor league of some type I am sure).  Measures about 8X10making it a large photo for the age.  It has a very old matting around it but it could be reframed if needed.  Really nice display item and 100% original.    $175\n\nJohn Tener (Old Judge player) campaign pin when he ran for Governor of Pennsylvania.  Amazing condition and circa 1910 I believe.  $35",
