      "post_content": "1893 N135 Honest Long Cut - Left on Base - Talk of the Diamond in an SGC 30.  Excellent graphics on this card.  Pictured on the left is the drawing of a baseball player, and on the right is a comic drawing.  One of the more desirable sets that you just don't see cards from very often.\n\n$60 now takes it!\n\n[img]http://www.247hq.com/1893.jpg[/img]",
