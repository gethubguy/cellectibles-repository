      "post_content": "Freshly slabbed as authentics by SGC due to the borders being trimmed off a long time ago and small light red ink applied in lettering or object, these rarities have nice images otherwise.  Most of the backs have a name of previous owner stamped neatly on back as well.  None of these have been skinned.  Fill in your tough poses cheap here.  Prices include deliver.  I will try to add images later but feel free to email me for scans.  First confirmation via email takes the item. The last batch from this group sold very quick on ebay for way over what i posted here so act fast!  All are SGC AUT\n\nPS PAypal add 3%.
