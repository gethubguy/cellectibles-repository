      "post_content": "Hello, I usually come on the board looking for T210 series 6 cards because I am from and still live in Kentucky.  I would really like to own just one old judge louisville card for my kentucky collection and I am looking for any low grade examples someone might have regardless of the player.  I understand these are highly collectible but if anyone has any piece they can sell just email me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  This is a rare time when I have some extra money to spend and I would really like to get just one.  I will consider high grade examples but they may be out of my price range.  Thank you for your time as always\n\nWilliam",
