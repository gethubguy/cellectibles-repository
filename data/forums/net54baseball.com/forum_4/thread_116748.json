      "post_content": "Due to recent issue I need to raise a small amount of cash.  I will sell all of my SGC AUT graded OJs listed on ebay under pastime08 to first buyer who can pay via check or MO for 60% of my BINs.  I had been getting anywhere from 80-100% as singles for these before.  I think there are 8-12 left.  Images can be viewed online.  Thanks Eric for picking up the Browns Champions group.  I want to sell at this discount the entire group only.  I would consider 80% for individual cards.  Also I have a group of 1960 Topps baseball hoard on there as well at $3,750.  I would take $2K to any board member here if by check or MO.  Thanks for any interest.\n\nJason",
