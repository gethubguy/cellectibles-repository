The reality is, they may not have any Old Judges for sale at the price you're willing to pay...  Therefore, you're not going to get any responses...  The best approach (in my opinion) is to make one post and let it sit for several days or a week...  Then bump it every few weeks after that...  I've posted my Lefty Grove wantlist numerous times over the years and gotten very little response...  For the most part, because the cards are so hard to find that no one has any for sale...  Just because you make a post on net54 doesn't guarantee that you're going to get the card or cards that you're looking for....  Sometimes the best approach is to wait and be patient...  You will eventually find the right card at the right price...  It may not be here on net54...  It might be on eBay or elsewhere....   Good luck in your search...",

Please don't make anymore new threads about Old Judges for at least the next 3 weeks. If you post about something else only do it once and even then please be careful not to bump it too often. You are hurting others' chances of finding something as well as not helping your cause when you do this. If you have any questions you can PM me or email me. Much appreciated.....Nothing personal and good luck in the hunt....",
