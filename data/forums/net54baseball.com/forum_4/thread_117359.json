      "post_content": "N172 Old Judge Chas. Com[m]iskey (86-4a) -- NOW ON eBay with option to make offers....\n\n(Catching, hands cupped about chin high, looking up at the ball) listed as \n\"Chas. Comiskey 1st B. Capt. St. Louis Browns\" w/ 1887 copyright.\nGraded PSA 2 - Good with MK qualifier -- there is a black mark (should be evident in the scan) on the lower right border although I think the +\"MK\" is for the back where there was pencil (or something) erased...\nThere is a very subtle surface wrinkle on the upper right near the border otherwise I think PSA would have given it at least a 4 or 5 (with the qualifier) -- anyway the image is good (could be a little lighter) and the corners and edges are nice although the cut is a bit weird....\nPlease make up your mind by looking at the scans....\nIf interested please email me at:\n [url]bhodes@rcn.com[/url]",
