I normally trade and sell with newer cards on other forums and boards but I would like to try and move this one here seeing as this is right up you guys alley. It is an 1888 Old Judge Mcphee. I have attached some scans of the cards so you guys can get a good look at it. I am not looking to trade but just sell. Also, any advice on the best grading company for this? Thanks!\njosh\n[IMG]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y43/jdubbs10/Cards/sc0009101e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y43/jdubbs10/Cards/DSC_0001.jpg[/IMG]",

If this is legitimate, I suggest that you send the card to SGC for grading and submit to a known auction house.  It is unlikely you will sell it here.
