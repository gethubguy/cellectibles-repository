      "post_content": "1888 N162 Goodwin & Co. Boxers JEM SMITH & JAKE KILRAIN slabbed by GAI as Authentic. These cards were rejected for slabbing by SGC and then sent to GAI for encapsulation. Both deem them as rebacked. The pair looks great, but due to the altering, thus the low price. They were  initially submitted to SGC by noted Boxing collector, Mr. Hull who had a world class boxing collection, pedigreed The Hull Collection. The SGC flips are included w/ the GAI slabbed cards.\n\nSOLD!\n\nEmail:  [url]jaycos@qualitycards.com[/url] \n\n[IMG]http://www.qualitycards.com/pictures/050110056.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.qualitycards.com/pictures/050110056b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.qualitycards.com/pictures/050110055.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.qualitycards.com/pictures/050110055b.jpg[/IMG]",
