      "post_content": "SOLD: 1866/7c Northampton MA Baseball Stereoview\n\nEarly baseball being played in front of a majestic church. Several men hold early bats while another poses as a pitcher.\n\nStamped on the back is \u201cBurt\u2019s Stereoscopic Views of Northampton and Vicinity photographed by Houghton and Knowlton. Once source of info I have indicates that this location is in Easthampton Mass.\n\nThis is one of the earlier stereo examples dating to the mid to late 1860\u2019s as evidenced by the light yellow color and its sharp (not originally rounded) corners. \n\nExcellent condition with just the set number (11) on the front and the old impression of a sticker on the back.\n\nEarly stereoviews are still much underpriced which means you can still pick up a piece of early baseball history for a relatively low price!",
