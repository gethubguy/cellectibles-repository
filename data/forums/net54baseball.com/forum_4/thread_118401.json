      "post_content": "I have the following Old Judge rare poses available.  You will see the pose and the last price reflected from VCP.  Each card has had the borders trimmed off with some small degree of light redish ink on letters on the fronts.  Most backs have a name stamp on them as well as a few with light pencil mark.  Nevertheless, extremely rare poses and are all slabbed authentic.  The names and photos are fully intact and legible.  I may be able to add scans later.  I will accept first reasonable offer on these.  Email them to [url]dduncanvintage@aol.com[/url].  Payment checks or MOs only.  I can accept CC through my own merchant account if need be.

Most have great imagry and appeal.  The ink is very minor on most of these as well. I hope there is no confusion.  Feel free to make offers individually on these.  \n\nThanks\nJason",
