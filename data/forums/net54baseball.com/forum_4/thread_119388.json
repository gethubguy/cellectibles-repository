      "post_content": "Hi. I would like to add a type card to my collection if monetarily possible. My collection is SGC graded and would like to keep it as such. I would be interested in a 1886 St. Louis Browns Champions card. No holes or creases, trimmed ok, back damage ok. Just a nice clear image in reasonable condition (Authentic-SGC 30?). Let me know what you have. Send scans/prices to: [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nThanks!",
