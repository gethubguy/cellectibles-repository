      "post_content": "I have up for sale an extremely tough item that I had personally never seen before purchasing this one. It is a coupon (a little longer than a current U.S. dollar bill) that was put out by Buchner & Co of N.Y. the makers of the N284 baseball card set and many popular N-card sets (including the infamous N283 Defenders & Offenders set). This coupon advertises a promotion where gifts could be obtained from 1890 to the Columbus Expo World's Fair of 1892. \n\nCondition: Presents very nice but there is a tear in the middle of the coupon starting at the bottom that extends half way up the item (it can be seen better on the back scan below). Regardless it is a very cool item from an extremely popularly collected N-card producer.\n\nPrice:  $40 shipped. \nI also have a one or two more that don't have the rip that would cost more than this one.\n\n[IMG]http://starsofthediamond.com/buchnercoupon.JPG[/IMG]",
