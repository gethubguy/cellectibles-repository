      "post_content": "SOLD: 2 1880's Baseball Team Cabinets. There are a total of 10 players in the picture. Some of the gentlemen seem to be much older, so this doesn't look like a high school team. Could possibly be a college team or club team? Visible in the picture are baseball bats, baseball caps, and gloves. They are wearing thick quilted pants, with period equipment showing.\n\nThe cabinet measures 5 1/4\" (w) by 4 1/4\" (h).\n\nPrice: SOLD\n\nIf interested please email me: [url]crazylocomerk@yahoo.com[/url]\n\nPayment accepted: Check, MO, Paypal (no additional fees)\n\n*****Or would be willing to trade for T or E cards.\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/FCVCI/1880sBaseballTeamCabinet1myscans.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/FCVCI/1880sBaseballTeamCabinet2myscans.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk264/crazylocomerk3/FCVCI/1880sBaseballTeamCabinet3.jpg[/IMG]",
