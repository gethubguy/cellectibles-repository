It's on the internet, so I don't need your permission to re-post it in a forum. That being said, if you don't like it I won't post anymore pics from your collection. As far as my Garters, I don't have any. I'm one of those \"Armpit Collectors\" you like to talk about. My whole collection can be seen in the link in my signature. Feel free to use any images that you want to in your new book.",
