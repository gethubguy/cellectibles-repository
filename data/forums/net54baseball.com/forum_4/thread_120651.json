I'm just telling you what he told me. I see no reason it wouldn't have got a number grade\nActually, I wish it wasn't in the slab as it would look great matted and framed as you could matte out the edge flaws.\nCard has each players 1888 stats on the back\nAnyway 465.00 shipped or trade offers accepted\nPaypal OK\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ruckers/ebayimages/websize/album1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ruckers/ebayimages/websize/album2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ruckers/ebayimages/websize/album3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ruckers/ebayimages/websize/album4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/ruckers/ebayimages/websize/album5.jpg[/IMG]",
