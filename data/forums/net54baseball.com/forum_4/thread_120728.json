      "post_content": "For sale is an N172 Old Judge Jimmy Ryan.  Graded SGC 10, but with a great image and no creasing on the front.  There is some paper loss on the back, and some extra paper glued on, as if the card was glued to a scrapbook.  Great card for the grade. \n\n$225, shipping included.\n\n[URL=http://img6.imageshack.us/i/ojs.jpg/][IMG]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/4894/ojs.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
