      "post_content": "Hello, Card is sold, thank you!\nI have an SGC Authentic Tim Keefe OJ.  This card looks like it was removed from a scrapbook which resulted in major back damage.  The damage also went through to the front of the card, with resulted in some rips along the bottom border.\n\nI would be interested in trading this card for a low grade Cobb, maybe something along the lines of a W572 in the SGC 20 range.  I am open to offers for just about any Cobb, except for the 4 T206's, and the 33 Sport Kings.  \n\nIf I can't work out a trade this card is for sale for $325 shipped and insured.  Send me a pm or email at [url]rickmcquillan@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks,\nRick",
