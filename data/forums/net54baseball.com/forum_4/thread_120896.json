I was hoping that I wouldn't have to bust out the \"top dollar paid\" or the \"most discriminating want list\" thing, but I find myself still looking for Wright objects. If you can help, it would be incredibly appreciated.  I have some decent trade items available also, assuming that you don't want to sell.  Please let me know.  Jeremy",
