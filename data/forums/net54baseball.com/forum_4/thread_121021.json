      "post_content": "Hello all. I have this book offered on the T card thread as a trade. I will offer it here for direct sale. It is hardcover with dustjacket. I only read it once and it's AWESOME. A must have for any OJ fan. Official title is: The Photographic Baseball Cards of Goodwin & Compnay (1886-1890). Photos and descriptions of ALL Old Judge, Gypsy Queen and cabinet cards produced by Goodwin & Co. If you don't have this book, you NEED this book, it's very cool! I need funds for a Tcard purchase and hate to let it go. It sold for $125 when it first came out. I will leave it as a best offer, but I won't let it go for less than $50. Paypal (gift), money order or check ok. I'll cover all shipping costs (very heavy book). Let me know if you have any SGC T206's available for trade for the book. Thanks!",
