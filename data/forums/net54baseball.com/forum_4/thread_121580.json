The back is clean with some paper loss, chipping, and surface wrinkles.\n\n$70 shipped. PayPal preffered, USPS money orders and personal checks accepted.  Card will be held until personal check clears.  Emails take priority over posts.\n\n[IMG]http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q319/jay1065/Temp/oj1.jpg[/IMG]",
