My (admittedly perverse) preference is a PSA graded specimen but that's not a necessity -- I would like one that has a nice front and generally the grade I'm looking for is VG or better (but if its too much better then the price will likely be too high -- i.e. EX-Mt or better)...Anyway, if anyone has one they would sell, or even trade..... \nPLMK.at:\n [url]bhodes@rcn.com[/url]",
