      "post_content": "F/S N172 1887 Old Judge John Ward, 478-8 Horizontal Sliding Pose/Arm Up. SGC 20.    SOLD THANKS FOR LOOKING\n\nBeautiful Card.  The front is crystal clear, with great corners.  The front easily looks like a 50 or better! What downgrades this to a 20 is that there is a crease about an inch long on the back of what would be the top of the card side, and that there is a rectangualr spot about 1cm by 2 cm where it looks like a scrapbook tab/ two sided tape was on.  Neither one affects the front at all.  The crease DOESN\"T crack through the front. The front is beautiful!  The scan doesn't do it justice and the crease on the back hardly shows up in the scan, but it is there, but light enough that it doesn't show up on the front.\n\nPlease email me at [url]stkindler@verizon.net[/url] or PM me if interested. \nPayment by Money order, cashier's check, or \"Good\" check only please, sorry no Paypal.\nThanks,\nTim Kindler",
