I have no reason to believe this card wouldn't receive a decent numeric grade...and I think the buyer will be very happy with it when it comes back in a plastic slab. This card was offered on ebay and the winning bidder never paid (after 5 emails to him and several promises from him) and will be offered here for 3 days at the \"sold for\" ebay price before I offer it to the second high ebay bidder at his bid. NO PMs, emails will be addressed in the order received [url]Snoopy525@Embarqmail.com[/url] There are no recorded sales in VCP $229.49, $2 1st class mail shipping in a secure, padded envelope. SOLD\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/For%20Sale/n172_minnehan051.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/For%20Sale/n172_minnehan052.jpg[/IMG]",
