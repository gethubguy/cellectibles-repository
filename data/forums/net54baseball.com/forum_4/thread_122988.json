      "post_content": "Hey guys,\n\nUp for sale is a fantstic looking 1887 Old Judge of catcher Dick Buckley of the Indianapolis team. This card has been graded an SGC 50. The corners are extremely sharp and if not for the slight scuff on the front, I have no doubt this would have been at least a full grade, maybe a grade and a half higher. The back is completely flawless. Great image. Looking to get $300 shipped and delivered.\n\ne-mail: [url]rare_baseballstuff@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://s107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/BuckleyOJ.jpg[/IMG]",
