      "post_content": "Good Evening, Collectors:\n\nUp for sale tonight is an extremely scarce 1879-80 New York Clipper Woodcut picturing William H. Hawes, who played one Major League Baseball season with the Boston BB Club in 1879. I am almost certain that this woodcut is his only catalogued baseball collectible from his very brief Major League career. In case you are not familar with them, during the 1879 & 1880 baseball seasons, the New York Clipper Newspaper published a woodcut of a baseball player on a weekly basis and all of the subjects from the set are catalogued in the Standard Catalogue of Baseball Cards thanks to extensive research and information originally provided by Lew Lipset. These pieces are so scarce that there are no price listings for any of the players in the set.\n\nThis example picturing Hawes was long ago glued to a scrapbook page and the back of the page includes several baseball boxscores from the same New York Clipper Newspaper, including Cap Anson, King Kelly & Lipman Pike (Jewish). This item would be ideal for the type collector who is looking for one example of every catalogued baseball set ever issued. My asking price for this rare beauty is $SOLD dlvd. and the first person to e-mail me and state \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: [url]vguerrerobb@yahoo.com[/url]",
