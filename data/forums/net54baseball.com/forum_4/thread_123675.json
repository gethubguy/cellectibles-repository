      "post_content": "THE GRIFFITH IS SOLD.  THANKS EVERYONE.\n\nUp for sale is Hall of Famer Clark Griffith's rookie card.  It also happens to be the largest N172 Old Judge I've ever seen, by far.  For comparison, I've included another Old Judge (\"Long and Short\") in the scan.  (The \"Long and Short\" card isn't for sale).  You'll see that Griffith is much \"longer\" than \"Long and Short.\"  \n\nThe card has a pink tint.  It is pose number 5 in the new Old Judge book.\n\n$760 shipped and insured.
