If you are looking for specific teams or players I can probably help(don't ask for rarities-they ain't here). Cards of many HOFers are also available. Most of these have condition issues but this reduces the prices, and the photos are generally nice. Scans are available.\nPlease email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks---Jay",
