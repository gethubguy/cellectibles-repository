The back of the wooden lid has a June 13, 1898 tax stamp.  $200 postpaid.  Paypal OK; no discount for check/MO since I have to take them to the bank.  Any questions, please PM.  First one to say I'll take it wins it.  \n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/exhibitman/interestingbaseballcards/huge/1898%20Big%20Run%20Tobacco.jpg[/IMG]",
