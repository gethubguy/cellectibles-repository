One minor imperfection along the edge on the lower right quadrant on the front (touching his left shoe) and a couple of stray ink(?) marks at the top edge of the back.\n\n$325 delivered.",

      "post_content": "I've lowered the price on the Williamson to $325 delivered and have added the Clarence \"Kid\" Baldwin card below.\n\nUnfortunately, the Baldwin card is amateurishly rebacked, but it presents a perfect opportunity to pick up a very scarce Old Judge card for a fraction of the Near Mint value. Nice clear picture of a player who could have been a star had he not fallen in love with the bottle. $375 delivered",
