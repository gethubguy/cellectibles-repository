      "post_content": "Hi,\nAs well as trading for Louisville N172, I am now selling my Old Judges. Prices are next to the player name. All prices include 1st class postage with insurance.\n \nI need all of the Louisville players except for Wolf, Stratton and Tomney. Trimmed, ad-clipped, rebacked, small holes, skinned and creases are fine. I would like to have cards with pretty good contrast.\n\nClick on the player name for a large scan of the same card. Back scans are below too. Please e-mail me if additional card scans are needed. I will try to be prompt with replies.\n\nPlease contact me by my e-mail or by PM. Thanks for looking!\n\nPeter Baldes\nsquare5000 on eBay\n[url]pbaldes@gmail.com[/url]\n\nHere are the cards that I have:\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4748960714_bff3fe6935_b.jpg\"]Andrews, CF, Philadelphias[/URL] $75  SOLDBurns, CF, Kansas Citys[/URL] $75  SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4748960678_f31a651f21_b.jpg\"]Clarkson, P, Bostons  (HOF) [/URL] $150 SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4748960648_bb5129ea02_b.jpg\"]Earle, C, Cincinnatis[/URL] $65 SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4748960632_de6d9359d7_b.jpg\"]Larkin, Captain, Athletics[/URL] $70 SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4749032719_eb447fb69a_b.jpg\"] Jim O'Rourke, C, New Yorks  (HOF)[/URL] $400  HOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4748319787_b8ab6d7a14_b.jpg\"]Sanders, P, Philadelphias[/URL] $65 SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4748319773_956b2cfea6_b.jpg\"]Townsend, C, Athletics[/URL] $80 SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4748960572_c930d92152_b.jpg\"]Welch, P, New Yorks  (HOF)[/URL] $225  SOLD\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4748960560_c1d87285a9_b.jpg\"]West, 1st B, Minneapolis[/URL] $75 SOLD\n[STRIKE]E Williamson, SS,Chicago[/STRIKE] (TRADED)\nAlso have an [URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4748960586_48acd88221_b.jpg\"]Allen & Ginter, Virginia Brights Female Baseball Player - 3rd Base[/URL] $75 SOLD\n\n[URL=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1288/4664736780_5792aa4c81_b.jpg\"][IMG]http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1288/4664736780_5792aa4c81_b.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4664734460_aae7166fca_b.jpg\"][IMG]http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4664734460_aae7166fca_b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4664108859_739c584e35_b.jpg\"][IMG]http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4664108859_739c584e35_b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1266/4664114735_cc8d0958f3_b.jpg\"][IMG]http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1266/4664114735_cc8d0958f3_b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
