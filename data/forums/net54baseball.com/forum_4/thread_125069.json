      "post_content": "This is a neat little piece that came from a magazine.  The sketch is titled \"The National Game at the Zoo\".  It is dated August 1889.  An advertisement on the other side is for June 1891 so I'm guessing it came from a magazine published in 1891.\n\nThe full page measures 6.5\" x 10\".  The baseball part is 4.75\" x 6.5\".\n\nPrice is $7.00 (including shipping).  Please email or PM me if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/baseballsketch1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/baseballsketch.jpg[/IMG]",
