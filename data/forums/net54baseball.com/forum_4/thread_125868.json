      "post_content": "For your consideration, an 1887 Buchner Gold Coin John Ward HOF. The card has corner wear and wear on the back but does not appear to have any paperloss. There are no creases, his name has been written on the front of the card in what looks like fountain pen. I have no knowledge about autographs but I doubt if Ward signed it. The card is definately genuine. I'm asking $SOLD, if Interested, e_mail me at [url]cagard1@comcast.net[/url] Thanks for looking, Chris.",
