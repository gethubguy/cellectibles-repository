      "post_content": "Good Evening, Collectors:\n\nUp for sale tonight is an extremely scarce 1879-80 New York Clipper Woodcut picturing J. H. Gifford, who managed the Albany BB Club in 1879. I am almost certain that this woodcut is his only catalogued baseball collectible from his very brief professional baseball career. In case you are not familar with them, during the 1879 & 1880 baseball seasons, the New York Clipper Newspaper published a woodcut in conjunction with a brief bio of a baseball player on a weekly basis and all of the subjects from the set are catalogued in the Standard Catalogue of Baseball Cards thanks to extensive research and information originally provided by Lew Lipset. These pieces are so scarce that there are no price listings for any of the players in the set.\n\nThis example picturing Gifford was meticulously trimmed from a full-page of the New York Clipper Newspaper and amazingly presents in (EX+) condition and includes the complete, ever elusive bio found directly underneath the image. This item would be ideal for the type collector who is looking for one example of every catalogued baseball set ever issued. My asking price for this rare beauty is $SOLD dlvd. and the first person to e-mail me and state \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: [url]vguerrerobb@yahoo.com[/url]",
