It seems dealers are interpreting some of the actualized prices at auction as being \"steals\" and think they can sell them for quite a bit more.  At some point they will wake up to find no one willing to pay more then they did at major auction.",

Yet over the previous 15 days he's only sold 2 cards for over $500.  Clearly only the most irrational fool(s) are being caught by his prices...and yet he still soldiers on.",
