Players names are clearly marked on the bottom right portion of their jerseys in their photo. See this [URL=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=25079\"]LINK[/URL] for the 1889 Miller roster. I am only selling them as a group right now. It would be a shame though to split em' up after all this time, don't ya' think? They measure roughly 4-1/4 x 6-1/2 each. All three have pin holes on the top and bottom. I'm mentioning for accuracy, but this really shouldn't matter in this case. Can't be many more of these that survived, if any. Emails take priority over post's. \nThanks all, Tony\n[url]andreatny@q.com[/url]\n\n \nJoe Miller - \"3rd base\"\nJohn Mitchell - \"Pitcher\"\nJohn \"Dummy\" Ryn - \"1st base\"  (one of the earliest deaf players in baseball) Has a crease.\n\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/minnmillerjoemiller3rdbase-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/minnmillerjohnmitchellpitcher-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/minnmillerjohnryn1stbase-2.jpg[/IMG]",
