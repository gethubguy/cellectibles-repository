There is some creasing to the upper right corner and the reverse has some 100 + year old doodling.\n\nPrice is $12.00 (including first class shipping).  Please email or PM me if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/kimballtradecard.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/Baseball%20BST/kimballtradecard1.jpg[/IMG]",
