According to the SGC population report there were four cards graded 84. If you have one and would like to upgrade or know who has an 84, please let me know.\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v140/jennepenn/1884Catcher.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v140/jennepenn/1884Catcher1.jpg[/IMG]",
