Not looking to rip anyone off or anything but going with current value trends and the fact that a member of this board will most likely read this I just want to set it straight I am looking for FAIR deals. I have baseball from 1887 - 1954 for offer. I also have some boxing memorabilia from the 19th century and a boat load of authenticated cards. I am looking for 19th century football. Please contact me with cards that are raw or graded. Let me know.\nThanks,",
