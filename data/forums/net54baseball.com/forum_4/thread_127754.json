I just got mine recently and, if you haven't seen it, all I can say is \"WOW\"!  It really is the Old Judge bible.\n\nI'll take some preorders if that's ok here.  It will be a limited supply so bare with me.  The price is $79 per book + $5 shipping (continental US only).  The book is normally $125.  You would not need to pay me until I have the books in hand.  The books are new.\n\nRob M.",

Once they are in hand i will let you know.  At that time you can send payment of $84 ($79 + $5 shipping).  My preference if for a check or money order but Paypal is ok.  When you get a chance, go ahead and send me your shipping address.\n\nThanks,\nRob M.\n\nP.S.  I ordered a few extras so anybody else that wants one, please let me know.",
