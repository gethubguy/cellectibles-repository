      "post_content": "The image is an oversized albumen cabinet card of the 1884 Major League (American Association) Columbus Buckeyes.  They finished second that year to the New York Metropolitans.  The image size is 11\"x15\" and it's original frame, is 16\"x20\".  The back of the frame has some old wooden slats and on the back you can make out \"Pittsburgh\".  That is the city that this team moved to in 1885 and became the Pittsburgh Alleghanys.  Considering the size of this image and that it apparently made the move to Pittsburgh, I'd suspect it used to belong to one of the players.  From another team image, the players can be fairly easily identified as:  (back row L-R) Patsy Cahill, Ed \"Dummy\" Dundon, Fred Carroll, Rudy Kemmler, Jim Field and Willie Kuehne, (Middle Row L-R) Fred Mann, Tom Brown, Mgr. Gus Schmelz, Pop Smith and John Richmond, (Front Row L-R) Frank Mountain and Ed Morris.  The image has some of the best detail that I have ever owned.\n \nSold. \n\nRob M.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26601&d=1287672278[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26602&d=1287672311[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26603&d=1287672325[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26604&d=1287672334[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26605&d=1287672342[/IMG]",
