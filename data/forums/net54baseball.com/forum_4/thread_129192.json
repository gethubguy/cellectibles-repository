      "post_content": "I would like to (possibly) purchase, if the price is right, an Old Judge cabinet card. I only want it as a type card so player, pose, team makes no difference to me. Probably the worse condition the better. Graded or not. No HOF'ers and it must not be missing any pieces. Send scans and prices to: [url]quinnsryche@comcast.net[/url]\nThanks!",
