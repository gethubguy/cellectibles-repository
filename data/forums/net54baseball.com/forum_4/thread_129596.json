      "post_content": "Up for your consideration is this (authentic only) 1887 Old Judge Miller (Pirates). Not really creasing but as you can see edges have been cut and right corner gone.  Nice crisp photo, makes you wonder if he caught that baseball or maybe he's just playing hot potato :)\n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/MillerOldJudge.jpg[/IMG][/url]\n\n[url][IMG]http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq66/nollpm/OJBack.jpg[/IMG][/url]\n\nPM me if you want it, paypal (gift) preferred. Will check in tonight after 10pm at some point.",
