      "post_content": "Hello everyone.  I have a N172 1887 Old Judge Louisville John Ewing card I would like to sale.  It is skinned and trimmed.  It was given to me as a gift so I hate to get rid of it but I need funds for a collection of kentucky related cards I am purchasing.  These are very rare and hard to find.  I do not know what kind of price to set on it so just send me an offer.  If anyone is interested send me an email at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  First good offer gets the card.  I accept payment through paypal or check is find also.  Here are the scans",
