      "post_content": "I purchased a group of N172 Old Judge cards...the lot being described as a beater lot with some nicer ones included. I have done my best to figure out what cards definately have trimming or other defects but am not an expert. Therefore, any item purchased may be returned for a full refund no questions asked if the buyer is not happy with the condition of the card upon arrival.
