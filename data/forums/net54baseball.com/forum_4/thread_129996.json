I have a hard time bidding on a card with a photo taken from the Hubble telescope:D I emailed the seller and asked for better photos and he said he doesn't know how to email photos:confused: I might be missing out on a deal but it just seems a little fishy to me (bad photo, can't get photos etc.)",
