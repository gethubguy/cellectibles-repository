      "post_content": "I'm looking for some N172 and maybe N284 Milwaukee player cards. I'm interested in mainly raw, ungraded cards.\n\nI'd prefer nice eye appeal but I don't care about minor trimming... I generally avoid major front paper loss and large card length creases.\n\nSadly I don't have anything to trade... I'm just looking to get a couple specimens to get my collection going. I only have one of each type in very poor condition.\n\nThanks!",
