I bought this card from Mile High Auctions a few years ago.\n\nThe image is very clear while the edges and corners have obvious wear.  I don't see any creases or wrinkles.  \n\nPrice is $700.00 including fully insured US shipping.  Please email or PM me if interested.  My apologies for the poor back scan.  \n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/BST%20Cards/duffy1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/BST%20Cards/duffy2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg184/IronHorse2130/BST%20Cards/duffy3.jpg[/IMG]",
