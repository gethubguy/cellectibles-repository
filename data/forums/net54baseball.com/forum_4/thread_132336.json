      "post_content": "(Reduced) 1873c Wilton Maine BBC Stereoview\n\nOffered here is a superb, one of a kind stereo that I have not seen around before. It features the Wilton Maine Base Ball club outdoors, standing in front of trees and buildings. (aesthetically pleasing).\n\nThe stereo displays: Bibbed uniforms; early equipment with 3 bats and an early ball (held by man seated bottom right); captain belt being worn by man 2nd left standing.\n\nWilton Base Ball Club is written on the back in period fountain pen ink. The Maine inscription was done at some point latter in pencil and can be erased if required. The script BBC on the front is part of the 2 albumen photographs and is not written on the card itself. There is a small nick on the right hand albumen but this 138 year old is in remarkably good condition for its age.\n\nAsking $210 reduced from $260 delivered",
