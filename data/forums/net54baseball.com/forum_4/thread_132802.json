Here's the thing about his cards -you'll find them in any condition cause he didn't care, just as long as he had one; and secondly, you'll find that he stamped the backs of a lot of them for his friends and others and that he took copious notes on the backs for research. The grading companies wont authenticate them as being his, but most collectors who specialize in this will know what they are and should look like. Good job!",
