      "post_content": "I've got the following ten Old Judge Cleveland players for sale:\n\n1) Crowell - SGC 60 - $275\n2) Faatz - SGC 30 - $275 (would be a PSA 6MK or PSA 7MK)\n3) Hotaling - SGC 30 - $275 (would be a PSA 6MK or PSA 7MK)\n4) O'Brien - SGC 30 - $180 (a \"real\" SGC 30 with 30 corner wear)\n5) Sprague - SGC 30 - $275 (another PSA 6MK or PSA 7MK)\n6) Sutcliffe - SGC 40 - $250 (a solid vg card)\n7) Tebeau - batting - SGC 30 - $325 (another PSA 6 MK or PSA 7MK)\n8) Tebeau - throwing - SGC 20 - $295 (great image, small paper loss on back)\n9) Twitchell - GAI 3.5 - $295 (super bold image)\n10) Zimmer - SGC 50 - $275 \n\nMost of the cards that are graded SGC 30 in this group would come back as PSA 6MK or PSA 7 MK if the cards were cracked and submitted to PSA if PSA still uses the MK designation.  They got hammered by SGC because someone erased writing of a previous owners name from the card backs.  The fronts are unmarked and the corners speak for themselves.  Please email me at [url]Eangyal@roadrunner.com[/url] to ask questions, reserve a card, or for higher resolution scans.  References available upon request.  Thanks for looking,\n\nEric",
