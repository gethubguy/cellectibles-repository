I believe it was bought from Kecin Strause!\n\nAfter all this time has passed, I'd love to buy several more from this series. The condition is not as important as the fact that I meed a good deal n them. \nIf you have 1, 2 or more, message me the description and best price!\n\nI'm hoping to swing a deal (s) today!\n\nThank you,\n\nBill",
