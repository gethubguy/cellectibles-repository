      "post_content": "I'm asking for SOLD for these 4 Woodcuts from the May 3, 1890 Harper's Weekly which includes delivery.  All are hand cut but still have great eye appeal.  This is the exact price that I paid for them a few months ago from the auction section on these forums.  Paypal preferred, gift not required.  I recently picked up several other full page Harper's Weekly prints and no longer need these 4.  The Anson measures ~ 2.5\" x 3\" and the other 3 measure ~ 2.5\" x 4\" .  \n\n[IMG]http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff297/woundedduck/PC%20vintage%20NFT/1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff297/woundedduck/PC%20vintage%20NFT/3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff297/woundedduck/PC%20vintage%20NFT/4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff297/woundedduck/PC%20vintage%20NFT/2.jpg[/IMG]",
