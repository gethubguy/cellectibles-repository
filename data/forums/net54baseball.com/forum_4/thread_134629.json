      "post_content": "FS:  N321 S.F. Hess & Co. Joseph Noonan.\n\nVery rare California league of Joseph Noonan.  You dont see these often and this card shows moderate corner wear, but has a very clean back.\nAs you may be able to see on the scan, the card has some minor creases, but no paper loos and has very nice eye appeal.  \nA very nice example of this super rare 19th century baseball card.\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/cardimg/832/120234.jpg[/IMG]\n\nan excellent opportunity to add a new type to your collection for only\n\n$3,250\n\nLet us know if you want this one\n\nDave's Vintage Baseball Cards\n[url]gfg@gfg.com[/url]\n310 471 1959",
