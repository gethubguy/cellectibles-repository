The book is an incredible resource and one that I've turned to many times.  The detail in which it explores the set card by card and the quality of the book overall is phenomenal.  The fact that some copies are being made available by book wholesalers at a fraction of the price doesn't make me regret at all buying the book when it was released.  It's not uncommon for publishers or bookstores to produce or buy more copies than they need and then turn to wholesalers to recoup some of their outlay.  It happens with almost every book out there.",

So, the sellers try to get the bulk of their cost in that first batch of 500 with profit falling into the second.  A book like Richard, Jay & Joe (people don't always mention Joe in discussing the book) produced costs a LOT of money to produce--especially with as many as they likely produced.  I gladly paid the $125 even though I don't collect OJ's any more (for now).  It's a work of art.  The $24.95 versions will dry up soon........they're being offered in the REA catalog at $60.00.
