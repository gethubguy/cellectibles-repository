I am just getting into collecting them and I want to start by trying to find a N172 Al Mays and John Weyhing.  If anyone has one of these two players please shoot me a scan and what you want for them to [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \n\nI think I am going to try to collect all the poses for John Weyhing eventually if I can.  As always thank you for all the help\n\nTony Turner",
