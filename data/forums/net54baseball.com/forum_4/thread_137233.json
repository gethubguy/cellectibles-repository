      "post_content": "Offering here a beautiful team cabinet photo of the Harvard baseball club. Not dated but judging from uniforms appears to be 1870s or 1880s and measures aprroximately 6.5 in. x 4.5 in. Obvious condition issues but rare indeed. The tape on the back is actually on the plastic case, not the photo itself. Feel free to ask any questions at [url]javanbrigham@verizon.net[/url].\n\nPrice is $650 with paypal gift although I'm willing to listen to offers.",
