I asked him if he minded me listing this...\n\nHe has cards of the following players (I know there are multiple poses and variations to each player, but didn't take that information down)...\n\nIf you are interested in any cards from these players feel free to pm on here or email me at [url]tlwise12@aol.com[/url]. I will then connect you with this gentleman and he can help you with scans and specific prices. \n\nI looked at the complete list of cards and all were in VERY nice shape and the ones I asked about were priced modestly at $150-$450 for the grade of these cards.\n\nList of cards:\n-Genius Sioux City\n-Bradley Sioux City\n-Glenn Sioux City\n-Mills Milwaukee\n-Carpenter (2 player) Cincinnati\n-Vinton Minneapolis\n-Jantzen Minneapolis\n-Duryea Cincinnati\n-Schellhase St. Joes\n-Schenkel Milwaukee\n-Gleason Athletics\n-Madden Boston\n\nThanks\nTravis",
