      "post_content": "Hello. This is the first N172 Old Judge card I've ever owned and it's for sale. The card is Krock of Chicago and it's thicker than I expected it would be. I purchased this with a group of other White Sox cards and I'm not into the 19th century stuff. Card is priced with shipping included. Paypal gift is preferred. Please email me with any questions. Thanks for looking.......Matt\n\nOld Judge N172 Krock, Chicago    $SOLD\n\n(I would also be interested in trading for any E93's or E95's in lower condition.)\n\n[url]mattpienta@yahoo.com[/url]",
