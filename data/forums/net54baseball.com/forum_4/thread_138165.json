      "post_content": "The first is a very nice (SGC 40) copy of Harry Decker. Decker was a real character (and there were plenty of them in his era), but he was also very talented and invented his own catcher's mitt. You should check out his coverage in the book Catcher ([url]http://www.petermorrisbooks.com/Catcher.htm[/url]). $275 delivered.\n\n*** SOLD*** The second is a rather amateurishly rebacked, but nice-imaged Kid Baldwin. Talented player who drank his way to oblivion. Listed as a scarce card in the Miller/Gonsowski/Masson Old Judge tome, here is an inexpensive way to latch on to your own copy. $175 delivered. *** SOLD ***\n\nI'll listen to any trade offers, but I do have a want list that includes Hub Collins, William \"Buster\" Hoover, Jack O\u2019Brien, Joe Quinn, and Joseph Strauss.",
