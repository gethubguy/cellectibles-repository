      "post_content": "I have for sale an original late 1800's oval advertising sign for Allen & Ginter Richmond Straight Cut Cigarettes.  This is the brand that the N43s were packaged in.  These signs are incredibly scarce in any condition, and overall this one is in pretty good shape, although does suffer from the flaws obvious in the photos below.  There is NO rust on this piece that has deteroriated the sign, just a little surface rust on the reverse as can be seen in the photos.  Rather, the flaws are really in the image; i.e., it shows it's use.  No extra holes have been drilled in the sign for hanging purposes, either. \n\nOverall size of the piece is roughly 29 inches long by 22 inches wide.  The piece is all metal, and beveled on the edges.  Although I cannot pinpoint the date of the sign to an exact year, it is an original 1800's sign (and pre-date the sale of the brand to the American Tobacco Company).  Point being, it is without question period to the N43s.\n\nI've only seen one other of these signs, and while it was in nicer condition than the offered sign, it sold for over 10x my asking price for this one.\n\n$700 including shipping.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0130.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/DSC_0131.jpg[/IMG]",
