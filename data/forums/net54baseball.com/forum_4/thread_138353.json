      "post_content": "This card is fresh from an estate and was just graded yesterday.  There is only 1 SGC 70 higher and this is the only 60.  PSA has several higher.\n\nCard is very nice with a dark strong image and some corner wear.  \n\nPlease contact me at [url]jgallony@aol.com[/url] with any cash or trade offers.  A PSA 6 sold last year for near 12K.  I think this one has a darker sharper image.\n\nTrade wise I am only looking for Joe Jackson and Boston Store cards, but other super high end cards might be considered.\n\nThanks\n\nJames G",
