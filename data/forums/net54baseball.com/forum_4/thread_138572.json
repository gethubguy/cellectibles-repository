      "post_content": "For sale is a very nice looking card of the great Ed Delahanty. Graded PSA 1 primarily due to scrapbook damage on the blank-back, the front presents much nicer with only a horizontal crease running through the lower third of the card that does not affect Ed's face. Really nice for the grade. SOLD\nPlease PM me or email [url]crb_972@yahoo.com[/url] to confirm. Thanks Chris\n\nCard is sold. Thanks Mark.",
