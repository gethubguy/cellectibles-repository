      "post_content": "I have an ungraded Scrapps O'Neill available for sale.  Overall the Scrapp would technically grade a 1 or a 2.  However, that is due largely in part to some disclosration around the facial area due to glue that was once placed on the reverse.  Otherwise, the Scrapp is in great condition.  There are NO creases, no tears, etc.  Also, the original tabs that extend out from the scrapp are present.\n\nSOLD\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/Scrapps.jpg[/IMG]",
