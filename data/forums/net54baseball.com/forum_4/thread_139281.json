      "post_content": "I'm new to the older cards, and probably pretty ignorant, but would really like to pickup atleast a couple of the 19th century cards of Cleveland players.  I do not have any yet, and honestly don't know what all is out there.  I've been lurking and reading on the boards trying to get an idea.  Ideally I'd like to pick up an old judge psa 1 of any Cleveland player.  If you have any for sale please let me know.  Might be intereseted in SGC or BVG but first choice is PSA.  I don't have anything from this era to trade, but if you are interested in any newer stuff I have some of that.  Also have paypal if looking to sell.",
