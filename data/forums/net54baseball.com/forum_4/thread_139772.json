I emailed him to see what was in his upcoming auction, and he happened to have one in his personal collection for sale.\n\nPrior to that, I looked for a couple years for a nice low grade example.  This one is graded a \"2\", but Leon and myself feel it's a \"3\".  No creases or stains.  Higher grade examples have come up in the last year or two, but lower grade examples are tough.  Best of luck in your search.\n\nTony",
