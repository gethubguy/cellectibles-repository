      "post_content": "This is the earliest known Harper's Weekly baseball woodcut.  It's large, measuring 22\" x 18\" it makes a great piece to have framed.  This copy is in great shape except for the tear in the upper left corner of the cricket portion.  It also has a couple very small tears just below the larger one, but they aren't very noticable.  None of the imperfections are over important parts of the woodcut as can be seen in the scan.  Asking SOLD (reduced) delivered OBO, paypal.  First to post or pm gets it.\n\n[IMG]http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff297/woundedduck/HarpersWeekly.jpg[/IMG]",
