      "post_content": "Hello mostly gentlemen.  Looking for some help and some Allen and Ginter N28's.  I have the Clarkson (Thanks to Dan), Mulvey (Thanks to Frank) and Kelly while looking for the other 7 cards.  Looking for lower grade cards, probably 1-3's but love raw cards.  Looking for no or very minor paper loss to the back, no holes.  Don't mind any general wear or minor-moderate back damage.  John V has a nice N28 Bennett in the 19th century b/s/t section that he's looking to trade and is a great example of what Im looking for.  \nThanks and happy holidays.",
