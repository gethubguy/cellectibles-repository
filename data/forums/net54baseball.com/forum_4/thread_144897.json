      "post_content": "I recently went to a card show and found these 3 cards. I only bought 3, but the seller had a whole stack of them, ranging from topics such as the Civil War to Daniel Boone. The seller did not know much about them. I asked him where he got them, but he said it was so long ago, he couldn't recall.\n\nAll I know is that they are from 1884. I know that because the words \"copyright 1884\" appear at the bottom of each card. The backs of all three are blank and there is no name of a manufacturer anywhere.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about these cards and can provide some insight? Or has anyone even seen something like this before?\n\nAny help you can offer is much appreciated. Thank you. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm27/baseballguy57/IMAG0206.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm27/baseballguy57/IMAG0205.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm27/baseballguy57/IMAG0204-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm27/baseballguy57/IMAG0207-1-1.jpg[/IMG]",
