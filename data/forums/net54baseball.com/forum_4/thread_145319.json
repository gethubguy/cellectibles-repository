      "post_content": "Hello everyone I have a lot of two spalding guide Louisville Colonel team photos for sale.  Both feature Honus Wagner on them.  The 1898 Team photo is in very good shape while the 1899 photo is a little rough.  I would like to sell them as a lot.  I am asking only what I paid for them on ebay.  I would like to get 65.00 for the pair.  If you would like to make an offer on one or both of them though that is fine also.  Please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] if interested.  Thanks\n\nTony",
