      "post_content": "For sale 1887 Old Judge Toole SGC 30.  Let me preface this by saying I hate those \"make offer\" listings, but I really have no idea to ask for this card so I am looking for offers.  I obtained this card in a trade with a fellow board member about a month ago and I know what I had to give in trade, so I am looking for an offer in that ballpark.  I'm not necessarily looking for the best offer, just a fair offer.  In other words, I am not going to hold out and wait for the highest offer - I will sell the card to the first offer that I feel is reasonable.  Here are the scans.  Thanks for looking.  \n\n[IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/1887OJN172TooleFront.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x137/vintagetoppsguy/Pre-War%20Cards/1887OJN172TooleBack.jpg[/IMG]",

      "post_content": "David,\n  I believe there has been some confusion about my offer for the card. I guess my wording left some to believe that the card was for sale for 100.00. I have gotten emails offering to buy the card. My original response to your listing was to make an offer of 100.00 for the card. I was hoping you would either accept or reject the offer. 100.00 was not the owner listing a selling price.Hope that cleared up the confusion. \n\nDon Miller\n\nPS My original offer of 100.00 for the card still stands.

Sounds like you made the right decision.",
