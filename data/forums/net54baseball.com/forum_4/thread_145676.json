I'm looking to purchase any Leslie's woodcut (other than the Creighton memorial) and some other 19th century non-Harper woodcuts such as the Daily Graphic and Police Gazette. If you have any for sale, please PM me. \n\nI also have some Harper's woodcuts for trade (see list with photos for condition below) and would be open to trade other items in my collection depending on the woodcut. Thanks for looking.    \n\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/qFmC.jpg\"]Champion Nine Atlantic Baseball Club of Brooklyn[/URL]      SOLD\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/mbaqg.jpg\"]The Champion Nine of the Union Baseball Club of Morrisania[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/TosO.jpg\"]Presentation of Championship Bat[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/5A3bN.jpg\"]The Boston Champions[/URL] \n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/oVU90.jpg\"]International Baseball - The Philadelphia Athletics[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/WocLj.jpg\"]Match between Red Stockings and Athletics[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/O26xZ.jpg\"]Baseball at Blackville[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/fWKCR.jpg\"]Providence Baseball Club with Harry Wright[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/KeXkz.jpg\"]Winning Battery of NY Team - Keefe & Ewing[/URL]\n[URL=\"http://co.llect.com/i/1212/Ea3v.jpg\"]St Louis Players - Comiskey & Latham[/URL]       SOLD\n\nGeorge",
