Unfortunately, this is the highest graded one so it is not cheap. It is one of the very best though. I hear mortgage rates are very low so a second mortgage (aren't you a banker) might be an option? :)  Good luck in the quest. In scouring the internet and seeing some examples it doesn't look like a lower grade one will be impossible to find, though it could take some time. \n\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/phunc1869peckandsnyderfinal2.JPG[/IMG]",
