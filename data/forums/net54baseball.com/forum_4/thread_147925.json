      "post_content": "Just got this back from grading. Classic card but 19th century is just not in my wheelhouse these days. This is the nicest SGC 10 I have ever owned. I figured it would be downgraded due to the paper loss on the left-hand side of the back but a 10? The front is virtually flawless-nice corners, nice edges, only a REAL MINOR hint of a wrinkle in the upper left hand corner that can only be seen at a certain angle-definitely not a crease. It presents like a 5 or 6. And of course the most important feature of an Old Judge is the photo quality. Wright is notorious for poor photo quality and this one is very nice and fairly dark. Great chance to own a STUNNING RARE card without paying a SGC 60 or 70 price from an auction house. I don't need to move it at this time so just testing the interest level. Price is SOLD paypal gift, mo, or check which I think is very fair considering the pleasing aesthetics of the card.",
