      "post_content": "This card is important for many reasons, and is sort of like the Negro League version of the Peck & Snyder Reds card.  Great image of a powerhouse early team featuring Charlie Grant and a young Grant \"Homerun\" Johnson.  A trimmed example just sold in Goodwin for just under $5K, this one is a very solid SGC 40 and is $12,500 ppd.",
