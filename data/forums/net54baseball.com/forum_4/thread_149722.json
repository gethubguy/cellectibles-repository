      "post_content": "Dating to the 1880s, this is only 1 of 3 boxes I have ever seen or know to exist.  The beauty and rarity of this countertop display cannot be understated.  At one time, this box would have held approximately 20 Gypsy Queen cigarette packs.\n\nOverall condition of this box is amazing, especially given it dates to the 1880s.  The top is still attached, all graphics are still in place on all sides (please email me for detailed photos).  The blue lining it still 100% intact, including the wax paper bottom.  The underside of the box still retains a mint Goodwin & Co. NYC printing.  The picture below show the top and front side, as well as the inner label).\n\nBaseball-related cigarette ephemera has been on fire recently (just look at final auction prices for some packs as of late).  I only know of 2 Gypsy Queen cigarette pack transactions - about 5 years ago, a GQ pack changed hands for $2k+.  Earlier this year, a second GQ cigarette pack changed hands for $4750.  \n\nLooking for SOLD for this box, but open to part cash/part trade offers.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/GQ.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/GQ1.jpg[/IMG]",
