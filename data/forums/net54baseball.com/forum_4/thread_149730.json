      "post_content": "For sale is an 1888 Old Judge card of Fred Nyce of the St Louis Whites.  This card is in VG+ condition.  Three of four corners are very slightly rounded with the fourth being a little soft.  The lower right corner has more wear (slight peel back).  There is one wrinkle on the back and a small scuff on the right edge of the front.  This card is not skinned but wholly intact.  I'm asking $400 for this card and I only want to sell, not trade.  Please email [url]acowan19@gmail.com[/url] if you have any questions.  A front scan can be seen at the bottom address.  I can provide a back scan if desired; it is clean.\n\n[url]http://s134.photobucket.com/albums/q102/acowan19/For%20Sale%20Net54/[/url]",
