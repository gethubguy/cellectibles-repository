      "post_content": "Hi, my dad's b-day is coming up, he loves vintage photography and enjoys my card collecting, so I thought why not get him a cabinet or daguerreotype of a baseball team.\n\nLooking to buy an amazing cabinet team photo, or daguerreotype.  19th century preferrably, and looking for professional team's, not college.\n\nI do not own any, and have zero experience involved with these, so any help or info on where to get them would be great. \n\nThanks!",
