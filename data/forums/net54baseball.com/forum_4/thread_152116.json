      "post_content": "Hi all\u2026for sale:\n\n1889 Illustrated London News print \"The American Baseball Players at Kensington Oval - Visit of the Prince of Wales\" featuring images of Cap Anson, Ned Hanlon, Monte Ward and many others.  The piece measures 14\" x 19\", has been neatly removed from the publication and is completely intact.  Condition-wise, I\u2019ll try to be as detailed as possible.\n\nIt has been handled but certainly not abused.  It\u2019s completely intact and the highly detailed images are very clear.  The \u201cas published\u201d vertical center-fold shows no tearing and the 3 staple holes are not offensive (note \u2013 there is minor rust staining where the top staple was).  There is some light staining (across top border, a few spots here and there). It\u2019s held up remarkably well and will be shipped flat.\n\nFor more details, check out [URL=\"http://www.legendaryauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=120330&searchby=0&searchvalue=None&page=0&sortby=0&displayby=2&lotsperpage=25&category=6&seo=1889-%22The-American-Baseball-Players-at-Kensington-Oval---Visit-of-the-Prince-of-Wales%22-Hand-Colored-\"]this listing[/URL] from a 2011 Legendary Auction (please note, mine is not hand-colored).\n\nAsking $600 shipped, but would entertain serious offers. Email or PM me\u2026thanks!\n\nMike",
