Am more interested in the quality of the image than anything else about the card.  And if I actually had the choice, I'd prefer a batting or throwing pose instead of that odd bent over fielding pose.\n\nAnyway, a scan of Serad can be seen here:  [IMG]http://www.richardarmstrong.ca/baseball/Toronto/N172_Serad.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEmail (richard@richardarmstrong.ca), PM or post here if you wanna talk.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.",
