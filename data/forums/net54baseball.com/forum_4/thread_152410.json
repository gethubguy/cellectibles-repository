Most people like to get more then 30% value on their cards.\n\nI'd recommend adding a another hundred dollars.  75$ OJs aren't even fun to own.  I've bought 3 of them for less then 75$ and instantly regretted it once they were in hand.  I do have one that I got for 80$, that I love, and plan to keep.",

There's a guy snatching up every good BIN on the bay within minutes of listing.  It's gotten to the point where I feel like I have to buy first, then figure out if I really wanted it :)\n\nI just got this one in the mail today, I love it.  I value it more then I paid:\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/221044350552?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649#ht_1574wt_1072[/url]",

I do mind a skinned one however, only because I don't really know how to reback it myself.\n\nIf your going to limit yourself to an outdoor pose that has not been altered, for $75, you might end up with a card you can't see :)",
