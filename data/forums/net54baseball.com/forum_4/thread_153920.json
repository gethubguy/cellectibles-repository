      "post_content": "This card has a superior image.  Its flaws should be obvious, but are stated anyway:  trimmed, small chips  on bottom in corner and over \"ew\", thumbtack impressions on sides (no holes though), light paper peels on back (full card thickness though--not skinned).  Card is also very slightly bowed.\n\nCARD SOLD.  This card's image is what sells it.  It is much nicer than the SGC A sold for $367 and the PSA 1 sold by Goodwin (with pinhole through name) for $611-- in case you're looking at VCP comparable sales.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/imoverhere/prewar/various/huge/N172WELCHM.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThanks for looking and let me know if you have questions.",
