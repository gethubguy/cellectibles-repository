      "post_content": "Good Morning, Collectors:\n\nUp for sale today is an extremely rare 1890 New York Sporting Times Baseball Team Photo Supplement picturing the 1890 New York (NL) Baseball Club including four Hall of Famers, Amos Rusie, Jim O'Rourke, Mickey Welch and most impressively, Jesse Burkett during his Rookie season. This rarity is certainly the earliest professional baseball image picturing Burkett and thus a treasure for HOF Rookie collectors. The supplement measures approximately 10\" X 13\" and appears to have been trimmed around the edges and there is a tear from top-to-bottom next to the name \"Clark\" on bottom which is being held together from the back of the supplement by tape. Otherwise, back is blank besides the tape being present. The piece is too large for my scanner so I have provided the best scan that I could.\n\nThis is one of those cases where waiting for one in better condition could be a lifelong endeavor so don't pass up this opportunity. Sale price on this beauty is $SOLD dlvd. and the first person to e-mail me and state \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: [url]vguerrerobb@yahoo.com[/url]",

Out of respect for others, could you please minimize this activity and give others a fair shot with their listings?\n\nRob M.",

You were actually the topic of conversation this weekend with 2 other Net54 members about this very thing.  I think that you hurt the value of your items by lowering the prices and bumping them so many days in a row. IMO, it sends the message that your initial pricing is overly inflated.\n\nHopefully I have not offended you and look forward to some day meeting you (I work in Parsippany).\n\nJeff",
