I am not a 19th century collector but I believe the card I have is 471-1 (bat at the ready).  It is graded SGC AUTH and is skinned.  I had $125 on it originally, but will sell it for $100 plus postage if anyone is interested.  I can send photos to anyone interested.\n\nEmail me [url]rnovak14@wi.rr.com[/url] to see the card.",
