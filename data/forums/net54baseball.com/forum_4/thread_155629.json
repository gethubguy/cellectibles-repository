      "post_content": "1869 Kearsarge BBC Cabinets. Possibly the earliest known baseball cabinet photos. Also possibly the earliest individual photos of a complete team.  Cabinet photos were in their infancy in the late 1860's and these photos retain the red perimeter line that was typical to the CDV's that preceeded cabinet cards. These cabinets were produced by Kimball Bros. of Concord N.H. All of the players are identified in pencil (there are a total of 11 cabinet photos of different players) as well as their positions. One of the players is Howard Kimball, quite likely one of the \"Kimball Bros\" that produced the images.\n\nI am asking $SOLD (cashier's check or money order)\n\nThanks,\nRob M.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=72060&d=1345577667[/IMG]\nHoward Kimball\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=72061&d=1345577687[/IMG]\nM.
