      "post_content": "Good Morning, Collectors:\n\nUp for sale today is a very nice copy of a quite scarce 1889 Spalding Baseball Guide. The front cover is intact and in pretty good shape. All pages are there and in very nice condition. Back cover is missing but back page of book is still in pretty nice shape as well. Highlights of this guide include a very rare 19th Century image of Henry Chadwick as well as the only known 19th Century period image of William Hulbert. I don't want to risk damage to the guide so am not going to provide scans of any of the interior pages. Sale price on this beauty is $SOLD dlvd. and the first person to e-mail me and state \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: [url]vguerrerobb@yahoo.com[/url]",
