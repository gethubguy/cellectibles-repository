      "post_content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI struck out in Legendary. I'm looking to pick up an N173 cabinet or a Kalamazoo Bats player card. I'm not interested in the player or team. I'm only interested in the eye appeal. Authentic examples don't bother me as long as the ad has not been trimmed off. I can handle a top or left border trim. I'm not looking for high grade examples. I'd like to pick up a nice looking example from either set from Auth to 2-3.\n\nIf you have an example for sale please do PM me.",
