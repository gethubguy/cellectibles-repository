Obviously I know they are super tough cards but I cannot afford the high end examples of the lousiville players so I am looking for skinned trimmed or rebacked Louisville players.  I was fortunate to pick up a rebacked Scott Stratton from fellow board member Peter on ebay last night.  If anyone has any for sale please message me at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url] or through the board.  Thanks for you help\n\nTony \n\nI am especially looking for Scott Stratton poses from the set.  I have one as of last night.  Thanks.",
