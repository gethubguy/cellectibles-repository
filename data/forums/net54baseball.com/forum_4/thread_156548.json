I hate to have to sell it but I over spent for this month and have to let it go.  Scans are below.  \n\nI am asking $300.00 for it.  Feel free to send offers also.  Payment by paypal only.  I will pay for the priority mail shipping with tracking/confirmation.  Message me through the board or at [url]wacturner@hotmail.com[/url]  \n\nThanks\n\nTony",
