      "post_content": "Thank you, Roger, for the kind words.  However, I just got my integrity called into question by another board member vai PM.  He wrote:\n\n\"Not saying the price isn't fair, but you are wrong about paying more than that from what I see.  The past auctions tab shows \"Final Bid(Includes Buyers Premium):$389.00.  The maximum (could be lower) sales TX state tax is 8.25% so that would bring it to $421.0925.  You aren't making much profit, but it would be erroneous to say that you \"paid a lot more\".  When you really (at max) paid $4 less.  \n\nI didn't want to call you out on the board since it was information that you didn't even have to share and I really do think the price is still fair (even though I can't do it).\"\n\nI won't mention names, but I will clear up his comments just in case anybody else was wondering the same thing.  \n\nYes, the lot closed at $389.  However, that DID NOT include the Buyers Premium of $48.63 (12.5 %).  So, $389 + $48.63 = $437.63.  If you look at VCP, it shows exactly $437.63.  Now, I paid another $36.10 in Texas state sales taxes.  That made my grand total $473.73 (not even including shipping).  At $425, I would have taken nearly a $50 loss.  \n\nAt this point, I think I'm just going to hold onto the card.  Thanks for all who looked and were interested and the kind words that were said.",
