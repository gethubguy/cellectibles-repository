      "post_content": "I'm wondering if a Net 54 member won this card (lot #1025) in the last Legendary Auction.  I was the underbidder on this card, as I wanted this Washington player for my type-card collection instead of my current Yum Yum type card of Danny Richardson of the New Yourk team.  If the winner of this Deasley card would happen to rather have a Richardson card in comparable condition instead, perhaps we can work a trade.  I prefer an email to a PM.\nVal Kehl\n[url]ekehl333@aol.com[/url]",
