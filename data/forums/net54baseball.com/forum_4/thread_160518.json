I don't mind sharing since the data's readily available:\n\nI didn't get any offers here for this lot, or for any portion of it.  I sold the cards individually on ebay for $676, keeping two for now.\n\nThe T218's did not fare so well, but I also did not get any offers when I listed them here.\n\nDespite all that, it's always fun to interact with fellow board members and do a few deals, so I'll continue to post items here first, then move to ebay if there is no interest from forum members.\n\nThanks for those of you who helped me part with about half of a 1933 Goudey set recentlY!",

I'm sure a few good bidders slip through the cracks, but the angst of bad dealings with a few others is just not worth it to me.  I'm not maximizing profit, but I have a nice roof over my head and eat well.\n\nI only have two left, and would be happy to sell them - a duplicate of 'Taylor-Lawn Tennis' with a nice front and the back PL typical of the others, and Gaudaur/Oarsman - beautiful card with EXTRA paper on the back.  I decided to eventually soak the paper off.  Scans are shown above.  \n\nIf interested, send an email to: scottforrest at belltownvintage dot com",
