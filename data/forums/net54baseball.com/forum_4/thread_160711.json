      "post_content": "1870's albumen image of player for the \"Active\" team.  Image is a large format for its time measuring about 6\"x9\" with about 4\"x6 1/2\" showing through the oval mat.  Great content, but the edges outside of the matted area are very rough and there is a partial crease at the knees.  However, in the frame the image is very nice.  Asking $Sold shipped.\nRob M.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=82323&d=1356716669[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=82328&d=1356717141[/IMG]",
