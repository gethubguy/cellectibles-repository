Better scans available upon request. I may have additional inventory as well if interested in one of your items.\n\nI am looking for a few Leslie's woodcuts (not 1865 Creighton) and woodcuts from Daily Graphic, the Graphic, NY Clipper and some of the other more obscure publications.",

I think the only other ones which have a detailed team composition surrounded by a game in progress is an 1885 Police Gazette with the Chicago BBC and to a lesser extent the 1889 Harper's woodcut showing New York vs Boston (although that one is much less detailed). I have never seen the 1898 ILN before.",
