      "post_content": "I have a photo album dated 1862 from Williams College. In this album are (5) individual photos of players (in plain dress) that played in the very first college baseball game played in 1859 between Williams College and Amherst.\n\nI wondered if anyone would be interested. The photos are signed and provenance is available to document the authenticity. The game itself is well documented and easy to research.\n\nI will wait to see what response is given but can post additional pictures upon request.\n\nI also am not sure what price these become available at. I have been given broad range of value.\n\nThanks,",
