      "post_content": "Recently, I started trying to collect some n172s. Due to financial issues going back and forth I need to sell a few especially because two cards I need for a set popped up for auction. \n\nI am willing to sell or trade for a few specific cards. I will also entertain offers on all cards.\n\nI'm looking for in any condition:\n-ANY 1923-24 Billikens\n-Cracker Jack Evers\n-e94 Evers\n-e98 Brown (all colors except orange)\n-m116 Farmer Ray and Otto Krueger\n\n\nFor Sale\n-Mattimore. (Looks to be trimmed). \n-Ryan (rebacked). \n\nNOW TAKE THESE TWO FOR $80\n\nImages are available so please feel free to ask. These cards have flaws that make them more affordable, but they are still great looking cards.\n\n[url]tlwise12@aol.com[/url]\n\nTravis",
