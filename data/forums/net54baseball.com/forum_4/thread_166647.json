      "post_content": "This is another card from a collection I'm selling that was tucked away for the past 30-40 years by an old-school collector who cared little to nothing about third-party grading, Internet chat boards and/or set registries. Last month I submitted some of the upper-tier Hall of Famers to SGC.\n\nPrice is $xxxx delivered within the United States. (Please note corner crease, upper left)\n\nCheck or money order preferred; PayPal is OK.\n\nA commitment to buy takes precedence over an ongoing negotiation. :rolleyes: \n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]Feel free to email any questions.[/URL]\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n[URL=\"wolfie51sb@aol.com\"]wolfie51sb at aol.com[/URL]",
