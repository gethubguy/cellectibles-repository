Lucklily I finally found a job but it pays less than before but there is a future at least, but thanks to the wonderful vehicle emissions they failed my truck big and need to pay at least $450 to fix it, long story short can't afford the repairs so I have to sell my cards to get a new car, the truck is on it's last leg anyway, and I can not afford to finance a car, so this card will get me something good plus the sales of my others.  It will be good to have a reliable car until I truly get back on my feet.",
