      "post_content": "Beautiful N28 Caruthers PSA 7 NM (MK). Why the qualifier, you ask? Well, there's of course small initials stamped in a blank spot, on the back. Just took these photos with my iphone. Actual card much sharper (I've now added better, scanned photos, in post below).\n\nFirst one with $540 takes it, and I cover postage and insurance. Will listen to reasonable offers, as well.\n\n                             Michael",
