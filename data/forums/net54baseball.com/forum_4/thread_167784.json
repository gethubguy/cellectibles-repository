Most are skinned of the back and one is in 2 pieces. Beat up to say the least but if anyone wants them. Can have these pieces at $5 each or total of $50 for the lot....(before someone says something, I know there is a non sport section but I'd rather someone here have them if they are interested, and cheap).",
