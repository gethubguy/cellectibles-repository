      "post_content": "Being an equipment collector, I'd like to pick up a few OJ's of catchers depicting equipment.  I'm particularly interested in those with glove(s) or with the full ensemble of glove(s), mask and chest protector.  I'm not well versed in OJ's yet, but the image of Craves of Minneapolis is similar to what I'm looking for.\n\nThanks!",
