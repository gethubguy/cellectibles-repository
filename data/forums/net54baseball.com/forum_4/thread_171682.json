Thank you. Guess this would be the \"master\" set, lol. I will consider this more of a longterm goal.\n\nz28jd, thanks for your response. I don't have anything else to trade you, but maybe one day, right?\n\nMatthew H, thank you for your response. I spoke with Jay a couple of times. He has been a tremendous help, and he has been incredibly patient with me. I inquired about the Denny, and while his asking price was more than reasonable, it was a little more than I could afford at the moment. Again, maybe one day...\n\nIt really is good to know where a couple of them currently are, in the event I come into some extra spending money/have another NY NL card fall into my lap.",
