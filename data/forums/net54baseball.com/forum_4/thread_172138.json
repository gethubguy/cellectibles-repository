Card is sold\n\nIf this card looks familiar to you, it should, as I just bought it off the B/S/T on June 25 (Excellent transaction, btw, Doug. Thank you!) for $450. As usual, I got excited and purchased a card that I probably shouldn't have purchased. It's a little too much card for me at the moment. It really shouldn't have been the first OJ I ever purchased! It's like needing a car and buying a brand new Lexus, when a used 1993 Honda Civic would have sufficed. I am selling this so I can complete my Jerry Denny player/pose run (in lesser condition). I paid $450, and I would like to sell it for $450 OBO (via PAYPAL ONLY, please -- to protect both of us). I will eat the shipping (insured - signature - express via USPS), and I will ship within 24 hours, and send your tracking information immediately. If someone would like to make an offer, feel free to send a PM. See scans below. Thanks.    Card is sold.\n\nAlan.   Card is sold.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/thebeautifulgame/forsaleortrade/websize/WilliamsonOJFront001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/thebeautifulgame/forsaleortrade/websize/WilliamsonOJBack001.jpg[/IMG]",
