Has anyone ever heard of such a thing or have knowledge that these cards are legitimate and actually exist. Here's his response to my inquiry. \n\n\"ln 1888 Goodwin printed two sets of Champion Cigarette Cards, they consisted of 50 cards representing baseball, pedestrian, jockey, lawn tennis, etc. You could find them in Gypsy Queen & Old Judge tobacco pouches, these had Gypsy Queen & Old Judge writing on the base of the card & writing on the back. The other set (The one that l am selling) has the same picture on the front but no writing on the base or back. To purchase one of these you needed a coupon & then you could exchange it for a card that came from a Sports Card Album. The card l am selling is 125 years old, original, & 100% genuine. l am even prepared to give an undertaking that if the winning bidder can prove it is not 100% authentic, they can keep the card & get a full refund. But this wont happen because as mentioned this cigarette card is 100% authentic\"",

I think what the seller may have been indicating is that the Goodwin Champions album itself, may have been redeemed by coupon. That seems reasonable and to make more sense. The thing that was throwing me off was that some of the cards have advertising while others don't. In looking back at the seller's previously sold items I noticed that he has what looks to be a complete set, so my guess is that it just depends on the layout of the advertising behind each individual cut-out card.\n\nHere's a link the King Kelly (with advertising on back) that he sold. Its the same card that is pictured earlier in this thread and is currently listed on ebay.\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1888-Goodwin-Co-King-Kelly-Boston-Beaneaters-Cigarette-Card-/111087508710?pt=AU_CollectableTradingCards&hash=item19dd54dce6&nma=true&si=7zfRSWLdxhtZAudnI8kX5VcwHWI%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557[/url]\n\nHere's a link to the Glasscock (with advertising) previously sold by the same seller.\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/1888-Goodwin-Co-JACK-GLASSCOCK-lndianopolis-Cigarette-Card-/111089532599?pt=AU_CollectableTradingCards&hash=item19dd73beb7&nma=true&si=udE4k7TECMBYllcoNUK6Vscv0jo%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557[/url]\n\nHere's a link to a lot of 1888 Goodwin cut-outs with blank backs (but described as being from the same album)\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1888-Goodwin-Cigarette-Cards-Schaefer-Sexton-Slosson-/111092592071?pt=AU_CollectableTradingCards&hash=item19dda26dc7&nma=true&si=7zfRSWLdxhtZAudnI8kX5VcwHWI%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557[/url]",

      "post_content": "Sorry I wasn't aware this thread got so much attention.  I'll try to reply to a few of the questions asked of me.\n\nShown below are the two n28 and n162 ad pieces I own, Ward and Brouthers.  The n28 is off of the n28 Champion's poster that Wonka and others posted.  You can tell by the colors that are showing on the borders of the Ward that it matches up perfectly with the Ward shown on the poster.  It's also a thinner stock overall like the others were saying.\n\nThe Kelly that Dan posted about on the first page is from an A36 Goodwin Album released around 1888, about the same time as the n162 set.  You can see a good shot of this album below.  There is also an image below showing what the back of the panel with Kelly, Glasscock, Dunlap and Keefe looks like.  As you'll see, the back of the Kelly that is on Ebay now, matches up perfectly with what is shown in this image.  \n\nThe Brouthers shown below is cut from a different page in this same A36 Album.  However that particular page is blank backed, as is the Brouthers shown below.  The page with the Kelly has the large advertisement for Old Judge as you can see.\n\nDan, not sure when you spoke to the guy on Ebay about his cards, but I've shown him scans of the ones I have and have shown him the entire pieces that they were cut off of.  I've had this conversation with him in the past week or so.  I've not come up with any info supporting a theory that these were redemption cards.  But I've told him that the cards resembling n162s were cards cut of the A36 Champions album, so hopefully my explanation made sense.  I feel that given the backs matching up perfectly on the Kelly, Glasscock, etc... that particular mystery is solved.\n\nI agree with Barry's point about the cards only having marginal value.  These, while likely not easy to find, are likely to not carry the value anywhere near the value of the actual cards.  They are authentic, and were released at the same time the cards were issued however.  The Kelly on Ebay surprises me a bit since it's already up to $500...heh\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=107299&d=1374355057[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=107300&d=1374355130[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=107301&d=1374355145[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=107302&d=1374355155[/IMG]",

I asked the seller what he knew about the King Kelly cut-out card he was selling and how he came to own it. This was his response.\n\n\"I sell some cards through one of the last existing card shops in my area and there is a elderly gentleman that brings some vintage in from time to time. We became friendly and he showed me some of his private collection with time I was able to purchase my first card a Ruth strip in amazing condition but it came with a catch he would only sell me that card if I bought the Cobb from the same series in the same condition. From then on he let me pay with payments and I have gotten some amazing pieces like a small black and white hand tinted Ruth/ Gehrig tobacco that only one other has ever been seen at auction. Anyways these two he had (Anson/King) and I fell I love with them it took me 5 months to pay him for these so yes I am very surprised to hear that a similar card went for so little.\"\n\nMeanwhile, here's the link to the completed ebay item for the card that he won last month.\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/1888-Goodwin-Co-King-Kelly-Boston-Beaneaters-Cigarette-Card-/111087508710?pt=AU_CollectableTradingCards&hash=item19dd54dce6[/url]",
