      "post_content": "These are the only 2 examples I've ever seen of these cards. They were purchased from a group of 7, with me buying these 2, and another collector buying the other 5 (I have his name and contact info).\n\nThe first cabinet is pitcher Emerson \"Pink\" Hawley. \"They called him the Duke of Pittsburgh and named a cigar after him. They rated him as one of the great pitchers of all time, a king of speed ball artists, a pitcher who could field and hit, a pitcher who would rather win a game than cash in on a $20,000 bit of dishonesty.\" (from Pink Hawley's obituary in the Milwaukee Sentinel). Pitched 10 seasons in the major leagues going 31-22 in 1895 and 27-11 in 1898. As a hitter, he had a .241 batting average, and once slugged as high as .497 in 1895. His obituary says he started his minor league career in Fort Smith. He supposedly got his nickname because he had a twin brother. They wore ribbons to distunguish them, his brother's was blue while his was pink. However, this story is thrown in doubt when one realizes his middle name. He is the only major leaguer (through 2009) born in Beaver Dam, WI, a town on Beaver Dam Lake, about 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee. Although more than a half-dozen major leaguers have had the nickname \"Pinky\", he is the only one that was known as \"Pink\". After his major league playing days, he pitched in the minors as late as 1908 and ran a cigar store at one time as well as managing a bowling alley. I have included a scan of a 19th century Pittsburgh Pirate team picture as supporting evidence (back row, 2nd from left).\n\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/temp_n172/dana_pink_hawley081.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/temp_n172/hawleyb145_zpsf270223d.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/56%20card%20baseball%20collection/image_zps55dde658.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe second is shortstop Monte Cross. Played 15 seasons in the majors (1892-1907) with 5 different teams with most of his career being spent in Philadelphia. After his career, he played 3 seasons in the minor leages (1908-1911) and in 1915 played semi pro ball on the Media PA team in the Delaware County League at age 46. I have included a scan of his 1902 W600 as well as an 1898-99 National Copper Plate which both used this photograph.\n\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/temp_n172/mcross1.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/temp_n172/crossb147_zpscb5e8da4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/56%20card%20baseball%20collection/df25ed58ae1a2ef60339ecedf77320b9_zps32fb39fc.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/temp_n172/mcross3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI will not break these up, 3800 delivered.
