      "post_content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm looking to buy an N172 of either Bobby Mathews or Harry Stovey. I'm not concerned with technical grades at all. I'm looking for an example with nice eye appeal and a strong image. Authentic cards are just fine so long as the ad has not been trimmed off the bottom. I have no concern with back damage or writing.\n\nIf you've got one or both for sale please do send me a pm.\n\nThanks a lot.",
