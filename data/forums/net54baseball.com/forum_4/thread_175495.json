      "post_content": "OK folks, had a question regarding the Ryan card on if it measured correctly. I measured the card several times under good light (I'm going blind I think...dern computers and price guides), anyway, IMHO I don't believe the card was intentionally trimmed BUT it it borderline short top/bottom (I had never measured it before) by around 1/32\"-1/16\"... I firmly believe the shortness is due to the excessive wear at top of card (see picture).....not from scissors....(why trim a card on only one side when it has wear like this on all four sides?????) Anyway, with that said, I will drop price to $SOLD(thats what I paid around ten years ago)\n\nSo....The N300 Ryan.....$SOLD to first response via PM",
