      "post_content": "Neat piece of ephemera...August Beck & Co were based in Chicago. A few years prior to the tin (which is likely 1890-1905), they put out the \"Yum Yum\" photographic cards which were packaged in slide in shell cigarette packs called \"Yum Yum\" cigarettes. Their product do not appear to have been as widespread as Allen & Ginter or Duke, and you don't find many items related to the company. $150",

      "post_content": "Good luck with the sale, Jim.\n\nI did want to clarify that Yum Yum cards were packaged inside tobacco tins that look like the one below.  We actually know this with 100% certainty because the tin depicted below had a label affixed to the outside that read \"Cards are placed at the bottom of the Box\".  Also, as far as I am aware, Yum Yum was purely a tobacco brand - they never manufactured cigarettes or packaged product in a slide and shell configuration.",

I should have bought the one in Lew's auction when I had the chance. I am sure I was going after some of the crazy type cards he used to sell instead...",
