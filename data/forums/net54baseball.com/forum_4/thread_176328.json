      "post_content": "Hello,\n\nI am selling the pictured Old Judge N172 of Ned Williamson - pose 512-3c (if I'm not mistaken).  Interesting fact - Williamson led the league in homers in 1884 with 27, but never had more than 9 in any other year of his 13-year career.  He also had 49 doubles in 1883, but his next highest total was 27.  \n\nThe card is graded SGC 30 - it has a solid front with no creases and nice corners, but has been downgraded due to the tape staining on the back.\n\nPrice is $[STRIKE]195[/STRIKE] $170 delivered - PayPal gift or check preferred but any form accepted.  Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
