The transaction entailed sending a fair sum of money to someone I didn't know so I kept my fingers crossed that the deal would be done in good faith. Jonathan stayed in steady communication and got the card to me in a couple of days. I have subsequently learned that he has hobby chops going back almost to the Ice Age. He's a good guy.",
