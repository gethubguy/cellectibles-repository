      "post_content": "Up for sale is the following 1885 Harper's Weekly with a Woodcut of the NY Giants w/ fantastic, pre-Old Judge images of HOFers Radbourn, Ewing, \nKelly, Ward, and O'Rourke.\n\nAsking $150\n\nThis incredible complete issue of Harper's Weekly from May 16, 1885 is easily in NM/MT condition w/ the exception of light staining on the bottom right.  Otherwise, there are absolutely NO flaws with this item that includes player images of the champion NY Giants.\n\nEasily the nicest conditioned 19th Century item I've come across.  You will not be disappointed.  The scan simply doesn't do this piece justice.  No wrinkles, folds, tears, holes, nothin'.  I doubt any of us will look this good after 128 years on this planet and probably several house changes over the years.\n\nPaypal \"gift/friend\" preferred. I'll take care of all shipping charges. First to e-mail me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] and say \"I'll take it\" will be the new owner! \n\nThanks for looking.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/1885%20Ewing%20_2_.jpg[/IMG]",
