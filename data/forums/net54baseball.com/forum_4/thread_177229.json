      "post_content": "This large trade card was one of a handful that were found and have since been absorbed by the marketplace. I contacted Rex Stark a few years ago and he told me that he no longer had any for sale. ALL the cards from the find had varying degrees of use/damage. This one was apparently among the better half of those found - better condition ones are out there - but they come with a much higher price-point if you can get someone to sell you one. It does have some obvious faults as seen in my scans. Measures about 7 1/2\" x 4 1/2\". NO creases or pinholes.\n\n800.00 paypal gift or check/MO. First email confirmation gets it...............\nwilling to trade for cards to complete my N162 and/or N184 sets and I need an N28 Ward.",
