      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI am selling the pictured 1882 trade card from Forbes Co., entitled \"Victory.\"  It has been graded authentic by SGC.\n\nOn its own, these trade cards aren't all that scarce, and sell at relatively low prices.  BUT, this one has been printed on the back with a game ticket for a game on Saturday, July 1, 1882, at Union Park, Pittsburgh, PA, between J.D. Bernd Co. and Porter & Donaldson.  (These apparently were two mining / steel companies.)\n\nThe card itself is in nice shape with no creases, though the four corners on the back show where it was removed from a scrapbook.\n\nI am only aware of one other card like this which has been printed for use as a game ticket - it was the companion to this ticket, and sold in an H&S auction in 2011 for nearly $1,200 with the juice.  A link to that auction is here:\n[url]http://jan11.hugginsandscott.com/cgi-bin/showitem.pl?itemid=29144[/url]\n\nI am seeking $750 for this example.  Check / money order preferred at this time.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
