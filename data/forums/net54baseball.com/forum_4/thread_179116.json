      "post_content": "Up for sale is an amazing Buck Ewing N172 Old Judge card.  \n\nWhile the technical grade is SGC 20, \"Fair\", the card presents as EX/NM.  The card has relatively sharp corners, no surface wrinkles or creases, and easily has the widest borders I've ever seen on an Old Judge.  The only noticeable flaws are writing (in pen) on the back and chipping on the edges.  Please look at the high quality scans below and decide for yourself.\n\nI've seen other Ewings with this pose, but never with the bat not touching the border.  I also can't seem to find this specific type identified on VCP or other sources showing \"Ewing, C., New Yorks\" w/ this pose.\n\nThis is your opportunity to own a Old Judge HOFer in EX/NM+ condition for a fraction of the price.  Again, look at those borders!!!\n\nPaypal gift preferrred.  Asking $SOLD\n\ne-mail me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\nThanks!\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/1887%20Ewing.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/1887%20Ewing%20_back_.jpg[/IMG]",
