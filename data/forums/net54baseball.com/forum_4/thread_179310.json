My email address, as indicated above, is [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]\n\n2. I do not have a list of all the Old Judge cards available. Besides, in addition to the Cambridge Collection I have a large number of other Old Judge duplicates.  If you have specific cards you are looking for I may be of help. If you are looking for a representative Old Judge card I am not your guy. You would do better just finding a card you like on ebay. That is the best advice I can give\n\nThanks for looking!",

The lot has one of the nicest Griffith images I have ever seen, in a card that very often comes with a pinkish faded photo ($2500). There are also some really sharp Ewings, including an amazing bat at side pose. Also included are two very nice O'Rourkes, a beautiful Connor, and a nice O'Day. Also available are a Mack, some Wards, and a Keefe Gypsy Queen (not the Cambridge Collection one). The Kellys, the Rusie, the Wright, and the McPhee are already gone. If interested, I will send iPhone images if you email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks--Jay",
