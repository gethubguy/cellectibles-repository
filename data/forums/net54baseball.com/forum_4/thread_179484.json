      "post_content": "I have available for sale this 1889 N29 Buck Ewing.  Has beautiful eye appeal but was downgraded for what appears to be a small \"tear\" in the back paper that goes from the bottom of the 2nd L in Allen, down to the bottom border.  See closeup scan of the area.  Does NOT affect the front of the card at all.\n\nPrice is $1,000 net to me via paypal.\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/ewingfront_zpsef428e43.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/ewingback_zps40c815e1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img1513_zps7f7c66ff.jpg[/IMG]",
