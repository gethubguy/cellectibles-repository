      "post_content": "Hey guys. I've got a very nice and affordable Gypsy Queen of John Coleman for sale. The image quality is top notch. However, this card has been skinned.\n\nStill, this card could fill a hole in anyone's 19th century type collection and won't break the bank. I'm looking to sell for $250.\n\n\nPlease PM me if interested.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/ColemanGypsyQueen.jpg[/IMG]        [IMG]http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/Colemanback.jpg[/IMG]",
