If you have any questions please PM or email me at acowan19(at)gmail(dot)com.\n\nOld Judge Fred Nyce, St Louis Whites, Holding Ball (RAW)- $200/OBO  \n\nCard is in very good condition.  No paper loss or writing.  One corner has slight peeling of the paper on the front; all corners are soft but none rounded.   There is a surface wrinkle on the reverse.  The card is whole (no skinning).\n\n[IMG]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/photos/i-qZTnSbn/2/L/i-qZTnSbn-L.jpg[/IMG]   [IMG]http://www.aaroncowanphotos.com/photos/i-2NjgfSn/2/L/i-2NjgfSn-L.jpg[/IMG]",
