What conditions are you looking for? Do you have all the other cards?\n\nOK. I get it. Track and field :-) I'm missing 3 of the cards you're missing from my second set. I have a couple of dupes that I didn't sell last time out but not T/F. I do have some dupes of the between the acts you were looking for - would trade generously if you have any N43's I need.",
