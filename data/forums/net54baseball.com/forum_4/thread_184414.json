      "post_content": "Okay, Old Judge has past my initial review and I now have 3 Columbus Solon cards in my collection. I have spoke to a few of the experts on Old Judge cards, members of this forum as well, and done some review on the cards in the Goodwin book. Through all of this I have officially added Old Judge to my active collections.\n\nI am looking to acquire players of all the Ohio teams, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Mansfield, and Toledo. The goal is to add a card/cabinet a month to my set starting in April since I've already covered March with a nice Dave Orr from Legendary Auctions. \n\nFor those collectors out there with Old Judge cards, I will be actively looking on BST for my collection. Feel free to shoot me a PM with what you have available.",
