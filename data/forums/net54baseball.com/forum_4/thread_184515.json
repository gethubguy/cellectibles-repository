This is the Baltimore version, but an owner a long time ago did a little doctoring and attempted to add a new team (Philadelphia).  I'm looking for $PENDING or best offer for this card. It's not often that you can get a 19th century Hall of Famer for this price!  Shipping will be via Priority Mail with a DC # and I prefer Paypal Gift but will consider other options!\n\n[IMG]http://i598.photobucket.com/albums/tt62/smanzari/Dan.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i598.photobucket.com/albums/tt62/smanzari/Danb.jpg[/IMG]",
