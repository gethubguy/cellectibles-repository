      "post_content": "Hi,\n\nI'm selling the pictured N284 Buchner Gold Coin card of Tom Brown - it is graded a PSA 6 EX-MT.  Corners are nice, back and borders are clean - a nice fairly-graded PSA 6.\n\nCard is SOLD.  For that price on eBay right now, you could get a PSA 4 common, with 6's in the $500+ range.  \n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
