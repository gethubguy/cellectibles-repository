Any 19th century Detroit card/cabinet, letter, scorecard, memorabilia, etc. likely interests me.  Cash and quality trade material, Detroit and otherwise, among the possibilities.\n\nThank You!,\nJoe G.\n[url]detroitwolverines@gmail.com[/url]",

I guess my journey is most incomplete on White.  Of his 8 poses (I'm not counting McGreachery), I have four N172s, one N173, and three as Studio Proofs with overlapped coverage on poses leaving two poses unaccounted for.  It would be nice to have them all as N172s but that is one of many near impossible challenges presented by Goodwin & Co.\n\nI'm interested in all poses of these tough guys as I seek upgrades and trade material.  Trading for a Deacon White is often easier if you are offering a Deacon White.",
