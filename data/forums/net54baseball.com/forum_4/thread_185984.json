      "post_content": "I have a very nice and scarce 1887 N690 Kalamazoo Bats of Smiling Al Maul of Philadelphia graded an SGC 30. The image quality is really strong and the back is clean and problem free. There are no marks or paper loss.\n\nOverall a very strong and appealing card for the grade.\n\nI'm looking to sell for $2,000 or best offer. Please PM me if interested.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/63526_kalamazoo_bat_maul_zps099f4c90.jpg[/IMG]",
