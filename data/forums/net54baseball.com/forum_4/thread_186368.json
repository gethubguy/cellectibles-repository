My scanner isn't hooked up so the picture quality isn't that good.\n\nIf these don't sell by Monday, I'll add better scans.\n\nI'm going to have an SGC 70 Bierbauer for sale next week, so if you're interested in that, drop me a message. No price yet, but here is a crappy scan of it. I bought a different pose of him, so I'm selling the higher grade one once I get the other one in hand.",
