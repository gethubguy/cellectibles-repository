      "post_content": "This is an iconic image with amazing sharpness and clarity. The card has had part of the left and top border worn or slightly chipped away, but this in no way impacts this world class image. If not for the borders, this would be a multi thousand dollar card Please email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url] if interested. BTW, this card came from the Cambridge Collection. Note, there is a slight shadow on the left from my rotten photography--it is not on the card.  SOLD\n\nThanks--Jay",
