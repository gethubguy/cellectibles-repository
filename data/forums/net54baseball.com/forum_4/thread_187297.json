      "post_content": "I've added some Old Judge cards to my collection recently, but want to get some other type cards from the 19th century. Interests include other photo cards or Cdvs with baseball subject matter. I want to stay under $500 and I plan to purchase in the next 2 weeks. Please send pictures and asking price via PM or email [url]shernan30@gmail.com[/url] if you have anything available.\n\nOhio teams will take precedence.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
