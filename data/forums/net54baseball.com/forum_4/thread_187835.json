      "post_content": "OK. I spoke with my friend Ron and while he hasn't been marketing this new edition (12/12) - he's agreed to make copies available at a fair price to net54 members. Knowledge is power. It's a 29 page guide listing Frank Keetz and Ron Schieber as authors. It contains COLOR pictures of the cards and includes many updates from the last published Keetz guide. There is NOT a price \"guide\" rather just a simply presented complete listing of the known baseball trade cards by style and category and accompanied by at least one color picture for identification\n\nhe can be contacted at:\n[url]madmoney@neo.rr.com[/url]",
