      "post_content": "Approximately 8 1/4\" x 11 1/4\", original Old Judge ad poster. It is on thicker cardboard and is trimmed at least on the right side. I am not sure how much but I don't think too much.  At the very bottom the last \"Y\" in New York is cut off. Absolutely great lithography. Will come with a very old but not great looking frame. Added to my website with a larger scan, under misc. items, along with a few other things in other places...more added soon..$495 OBO Delivered for this poster. Item has an 1885 Copyright date on it but I have been told that might not be their date of issue...\n\n[url]www.luckeycards.com[/url]",
