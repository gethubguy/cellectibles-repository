I'm looking to sell the n173 and the Kalamazoo Bat posted below. \n\nThey are both rough, but are both tough types and are far cheaper than any others you will find. \n\nThe n173 has a light image, but is not a trimmed card. The Kalamazoo Bats card has the obvious tape, but has a dark and clear image. \n\nAlso, if you have any n172s I would hear trade offers for one or both.\n\nThanks\nTravis",
