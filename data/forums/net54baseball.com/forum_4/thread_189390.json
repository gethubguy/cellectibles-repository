      "post_content": "Plate copy from old Judge book. It is rare to see 19th century advertising that appealed to the black consumer. In the Old Judge die cut ad set, the company produced die cuts of women, blacks, military men, etc to show each group were potential consumers of Old Judge cigarettes.
