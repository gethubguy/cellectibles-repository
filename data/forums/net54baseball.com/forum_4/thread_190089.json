      "post_content": "Cannonball Crane got his nickname because of his heavy fastball, but he could have equally well been called Ed \"The Bat\" Crane. In 1887, while playing for the Toronto team in the International Association, Crane posted a 33-13 record, but more amazingly hit .428. This is a still standing record for the highest batting average in professional baseball ever achieved by a pitcher. Card has a beautiful image and an undamaged back (some light staining from scrapbook removal)----$285",

On a team full of Hall of Famers, Tiernan was a team leader and hitting star. He hit over .300 seven times and retired with a .311 lifetime average. He hit one of the most famous home runs in early Giant history, breaking up a scoreless tie between Amos Rusie and Kid Nichols in the 13th inning. This card has a great image but a small stain UR and some minor scrapbook damage on the back---$250",

He then spent a career in the minor leagues. Interestingly enough for California baseball fans, he was a member of the first Los Angeles entry into the California League in 1892. This is a beautiful card with a great image and an undamaged back--$285",
