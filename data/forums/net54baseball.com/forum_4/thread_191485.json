Thank you, Bill\n\n\"John Gibson Clarkson (1861-1909) won an astounding 327 games though playing only 12 full seasons in the Major Leagues. Clarkson pitched for the Chicago White Stockings (1884-1887), the Boston Beaneaters (1888-1892) and the Cleveland Spiders (1892-1894). Known as an extremely sensitive, but durable hurler, from 1885-1889 Clarkson won 209 games (53 in 1885 alone) and led the National League in wins, games pitched and strikeouts in three of those campaigns. In 1889, John won the Triple Crown in pitching with 49 wins, 284 strikeouts and a 2.73 ERA. Utilizing various curveballs, Clarkson preyed on the weaknesses of the batters confounding them to wonder what might come next. John Clarkson won 30 games in six consecutive seasons, was the ERA champion in 1889, the wins champion three times (1885, 1887, 1889), and the strikeout champion three times (1885, 1887, 1889). Clarkson retired with 327 wins, 2,015 strikeouts and a 2.81 earned run average. The Veterans Committee elected John Gibson Clarkson to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963.\"    <- pillaged from web. :)",
