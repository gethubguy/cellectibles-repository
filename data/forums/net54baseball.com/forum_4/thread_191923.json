      "post_content": "These are LARGE 1880s baseball trade cards that measure approximately 4\" x 7\".  These cards look very similar to a couple of different 1880s trade card sets made by Tobin Lithographs.  This set is not cataloged (except probably in the Keetz book).  There are only 4 cards in the set.  These are extremely rare.  I have only seen one or two examples of each in the past 20 years.  \n\nLAST ONE: \"A Home Run\" is clean and crease-free, but has some slight scuffing at the top border and there is some paper loss on back.\n\nLooking for $175 shipped each.  The 6x8 case is included with the card.\n\nThanks.\n\nChris\n[url]staindsox@hotmail.com[/url]",
