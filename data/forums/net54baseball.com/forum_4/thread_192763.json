      "post_content": "Up for sale (or trade perhaps) is a tough pose of a key Detroit Hall of Famer -- Sam Thompson, bat at 45 degrees.\n\nFair-good condition, wear and spots of chipping along edges, rounded corners, pretty nice image. Back is a little dirty, but no writing or paper loss or heavy stains. Solid little card. (Will grade if you're into that sort of thing.) Yours for [STRIKE]$1200[/STRIKE] [no longer available -- out for grading and consignment]\n\nI'll entertain other offers, including interesting trades, but \"I'll take it\" trumps a negotiation in progress.\n\nAny non-fee payment method is fine, but I may hold a personal check for up to 10 days if I don't know you. If you want to do regular Paypal, please add 2%, and I'll pick up the remainder. Priority shipping with insurance is included in the cost.",
