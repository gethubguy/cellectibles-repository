      "post_content": "Gents,\n\nI have recently gotten into vintage baseball cards. This forum has been great for finding vintage treasures and learning more about the hobby.\n\nWith that being said, I am looking for a baseball card from the first set / first time a baseball card was released to the general public. \n\nThrough some quick research I came up with 1863 as the earliest year that a baseball card was created/released... I know that there are a lot of professional-collectors on this site so I was hoping that through a few individuals support, I could find out when the first card was released, and if anyone has one for sale.\n\nMy only requests are that the price wont break the bank, and that the card is graded. \n\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated!",

If you are not looking for a Hall of Famer, you can pick up a nice Old Judge card for a few hundred dollars.
