      "post_content": "Gents,\n\nA few posts back I was looking to get a baseball card from one of the earliest sets made (Just to say that I had one). Through posts and pm's from a few forum members (thank you all), it looks like finding a card from the 1887 Old Judge Set might be best for me.\n\nGrowing up and playing baseball right into the Marlins Minor League system, I would always participate in the Connie Mack league/Tournament. It pans out that there is a Connie Mack Old Judge Card, and therefore this might be single card I purchase.\n\nLooking to see if someone here has one for sale. If so please pm a picture and a price. Only asks are that the card is graded and is shown in full.\n\nThanks again everyone for your help so far in this quest of mine!\n\nCheers!",
