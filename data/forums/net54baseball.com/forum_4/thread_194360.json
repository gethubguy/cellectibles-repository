      "post_content": "Since I got this card a few years ago the scope of my collection has changed a bit. I still love this card but I am not sure that it is a good fit for me any longer, so I am putting it up for trade. I am mainly interested in M101-6 cards, a Harry Wright card, and 20th century HOF cards from tough sets. Not the most focused list I know, but if you are interested and think we could work something out, shoot me a note via PM. I would also consider an outright sale if that is preferable.\n\nHere is a scan of the front - the back is clean but I can get a scan of that as well if desired.\n\nThanks\n\n\nChris",
