      "post_content": "Unfortunately I need to raise some quick funds so I have decided to sell this N43 Ewing PSA 4.  Paid close to $5k looking for first $4k.  It is the key to the set and very tough to find with this eye appeal.  Back is bold and front has best color I have seen on one of these.  PP gift or overnight payment via check only.  \nAlso will post some T cards in the appropriate thread.  Card is currently listed on ebay under pastime08 seller.  You can see images there, otherwise I will scan and post when I get home later or I can text phone photo I have with PM of number.  Thanks.  Please PM me today if interested.  \n\nThanks\nJason",
