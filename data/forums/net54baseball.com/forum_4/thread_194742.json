Other than those few the rest will need to come from networking here.\n\nI started a Columbus team set (single pose) in January with most of my cards coming from Net54 members. Only have 3 more left to find before I start working on a second pose of each (Weyhing removed since there is only one pose of him).\n\nIf I come across any I'll let you know.\n\nSteven",
