      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nN162 Goodwin Champions King Kelly Has been SOLD.\n\nN172 Old Judge \"Sliding\" Billy Hamilton has been SOLD.\n\nKelly has paper loss and Billy has a mark/scratch on the bottom front. Both still present very well with distinct colors and great contrast. Very nice low grade options for both of these HOFers.\n\nFeel free to email me at [url]mikewolf.nyc@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks!\nMike",
