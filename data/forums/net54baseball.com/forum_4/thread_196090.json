The printing (player names, etc) has been trimmed from around it, leaving a 'cdv' look.  The image itself is extremely clear and in great shape - compare the 'C' on the jerseys with other images.  **SOLD**",

      "post_content": "I've had three emails asking me what the sales price was.  I don't divulge that information for one reason: buyers generally assume that I won't, which gives them the freedom to post the item without thinking their financial decision will be revealed.  If they want to give you the price, fine. \n\nThis brings up an interesting point about posting sale prices here, which has been debated a few times.  Yes, most AH's allow you to see final bid prices; however, they don't post the winning bidder's name.  To me it's all about tying the price to a name - that should be the new owner's decision.\n\nEven though it happened in a flash, it was really fun to sell this card (more fun to own it).  The new owner was very happy to get it, and that takes the sting out of relinquishing it.  Also, parting with one of your favorite collectibles makes it easier to let go of the less-desirable ones, and I really need to do that.",
