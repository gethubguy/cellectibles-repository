      "post_content": "Super Clean W.H. \"Yale\" Murphy N566 Newsboy card.  Murphy was 24 years old on his way to his only real season in the majors with the New York Giants of 1894 when this cabinet was produced.  \n\nOne of only (3) street-clothed guys in the Newsboy set and pretty tough to find in any condition.  Can't imagine there's a better one out there.  Just a very light smudge on the back which is not intrusive and the front is crystal clear except for a slightly discernable wave in the albumen photo at the very bottom center that was obviously part of putting it on the mount.  \n\nTypical curve to the mount that, if graded, would flatten nicely.  Beautiful piece.  $1250 OBO.  Paypal FF or check/money order.\n\n[url]http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/murphya01.shtml[/url]\n\n\n[IMG]http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZPg9OL5arZM/VFIugnLXfdI/AAAAAAAAgws/xCpRD4kF0q4/s800/WHMurphy.JPG[/IMG]",
