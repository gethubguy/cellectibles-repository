      "post_content": "Early Oliver Optics Publication Collection x25 (24 from 1868-69 and 1 from 1874 - there are 2 dupes) - PRICE REDUCTION was $375 now just $250 delivered ($10per copy).\n\nThese not only have the attractive baseball graphic on the front cover but include baseball write-ups inside. As these were published right in the middle of the Red Stocking's ascendency, the content is very Reds centric.\n\nThese are getting now and it would be difficult to acquire another run like this.\n\nCondition wise, most of these are in really good shape with just 4 or 5 with moderate condition problems.",
