      "post_content": "For sale is a rare 1890 Old Judge card. Not only is it tough to find cards from the last year of production, they are usually low grade when you can find them. SGC 55 Harry Decker NL card. ON HOLD\n\n  Also have a Bobby Mathews. High on a lot of wantlists because he has 297 career wins and will likely make the Hall of Fame someday(you would assume). Nice looking SGC 40. SOLD\n\n  I included bigger scans of each card to show more detail, but the true color of the cards are the ones where you can see the full holder",
