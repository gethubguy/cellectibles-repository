      "post_content": "My wife has some grand Christmas ideas so I'm giving in and selling a few cards to treat her. \n\nFirst up for grabs is \"Long John\" Reilly. The card has a nice image and a pretty neat stamp in the back from, more the likely, the original owner.\nI'm asking SOLD dlvd.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=587&pictureid=16805[/IMG]  [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=587&pictureid=16806[/IMG]\n\nSecond is one of the few Standing Bat poses in the N172 set. Paul Hines of the Washington Nationals has a great image with a clean back. This was purchased this summer at National and has be proudly displayed as one of the few OJs I have that are not a part of my Columbus Solons set.\nAsking price is SOLD dlvd.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=587&pictureid=16807[/IMG]  [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=587&pictureid=16808[/IMG]\n\nIf you are interested PM or email, [url]shernan30@gmail.com[/url].\n\nThanks for looking, \n\nSteven",
