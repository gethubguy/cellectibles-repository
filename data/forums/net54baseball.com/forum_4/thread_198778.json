Offering up this beautiful N321 SF Hess card of Sweeney for trade. It is conservatively graded PSA 2 because of the slight tobacco stain on the bottom left corner. Otherwise a VG+ card all around. \n\nI'm only looking to trade this card for a E107 HOFer. Cash could be involved on either side if needed. Please let me know if you have something that might work. Thanks for your time, Ben. \n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/fisherboy7/thetop25/N321Sweeney.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/fisherboy7/tobaccocards/n321sweeney2.jpg[/IMG]",
