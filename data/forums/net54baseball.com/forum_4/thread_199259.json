      "post_content": "Special interest in photos, books owned or inscribed by Wright relating to baseball or cricket, early items etc ( sorry, do not need business documents or cuts).  Possible trade items include 1868 Chadwick, Game of Baseball, other early, rare baseball books, 1879 Boston team composite (Legendary auction), Fraley Rogers, Warren photo (RMY auction)----try me, i am sure we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Thank you.   Premium for a photo of George Wright with Spalding.  I will respond to PM and/or email.  This is my first BST thread and if it should be in memorabilia instead of this, please move, I decided to go with 19th century to start.",
