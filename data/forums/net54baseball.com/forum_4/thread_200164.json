If more are ever acquired, we will re-post!\n\nWe purchased quite a number (too many for our purposes it turns out) of The Photographic Baseball Cards of Goodwin & Co. ~ 1886-1890 and will now sell at $58 delivered until our stock is reduced to 10 or fewer. In the past we have sold a couple of dozen at $75 plus $7.75 shipping. \n\nAll are new, never opened in original box.\n\nThis is the monumental 459-page, 5-plus pound, hardbound reference work by Jay Miller, Joe Gonsowski & Richard Masson which covers: \n\nHistory of Goodwin & Co. ~ 1886 Old Judge Cards ~ Gypsy Queens ~ 1888 Old Judge Cards ~ 1889 Old Judge Cards ~ Old Judge Cabinets ~ Old Judge Production ~ Old Judge Rarities ~ Old Judge Reprints/Reissues ~ Other Goodwin & Co. Baseball Issues ~ Goodwin & Co. Advertising ~ Overview - Old Judge at a Glance ~ Player Biographies\n\nOriginally retailing at $125, it is an awesome book. Ours are still sealed in the original box and will be shipped double-boxed to assure fresh, new condition.\n\nFor those who may like a copy of another key reference, we also have a few copies of Lew Lipset's ENCYCLOPEDIA of Baseball Cards: 3 Volumes Combined at $35 delivered.\n\nPayment by check, money order or Paypal.

Well worth the money.\n\nI feel I got twice the value out of it as my wife spent about an hour looking through it as well. When I told her how much I spent on it (usually not an issue anyway), she said it was well worth it.\n\nHappy wife, happy collecting. Thanks again for making this available! :)",
