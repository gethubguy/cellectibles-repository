      "post_content": "I've had several Net54 members reach out to me about the availability of this card.  I've finally decided to let it go and wanted to give anyone interested an opportunity to acquire.\n\nI'll be accepting offers for this wonderful postcard through Friday January 30, 7PM PST.\n\nThis is not an auction, offers from interested parties will not be disclosed, please do not ask.\n\nNo \"top all\" offers accepted.\n\nAbout the card, no creases, staining on back does slightly affect the card front/image, note slight color difference in uniforms, slight corner/edge wear.  Joe Jackson seated, far right.\n\nPlease contact me with any other questions.\n\nThank you.\n\nJim\n\n[url]jsrna@aol.com[/url]",
