      "post_content": "Hi All,\n\nI have for sale this very nice double paged woodcut (16\" x 23\") depicting the London visit of the famous World Baseball Tour of 1888-89. It is titled \"The American Baseball Players at Kennington Oval--Visit of the Prince of Wales\" and includes Anson, Ward and many other notable players. It is in superb condition with no toning and only center crease as to be expected from the publication (Illustrated London News). It's actually still in the original publication which appears to be missing 2 pages. A perfect item for framing. \n\n\n\nFull, double paged baseball woodcuts are tough to come by particularly if they are non-Harper or Leslie's woodcuts. I know of only a handful that incorporate player portraits with a game in progress while providing this level of detail (the other notable one is the Leslie's woodcut depicting James Creighton).\n\n\n\nSOLD",
