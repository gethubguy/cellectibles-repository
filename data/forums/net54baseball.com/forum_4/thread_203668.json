      "post_content": "I'm expanding my Columbus Old Judge set this year to include any player that played on the Columbus Buckeyes (1883-1884) or Columbus Solons (1889-1891). I've only been getting cards that have the team listed as Columbus.\n\nSo, to get this started I'd like to add a card of a player or manager who played for the Buckeyes. Here is the list:\n\n[STRIKE]Patsy Cahill (John Francis)[/STRIKE]\nRudy Kemmler (Rudolph)\n[STRIKE]Fred Mann[/STRIKE]\nGus Schmelz\n\nAn overview of condition I look for:\n\n  * Graded or Raw (I buy the card not so much the grade)\n  * Strong image is always best\n  * Trimming to a minimum (must have advertisement)\n  * Rebacked okay\n  * No skinned cards\n\n\nPm or email, shernan30@gmail, any scans and prices.\n\nSteven",
