      "post_content": "Hello I've never bought an old judge card and not sure how expensive they are, but presume they're more than t206's which is my primary focus. \n\nI'm looking for a Dick Buckley simply for the reason that we share the same last name. I know there's two different versions of his card. Either will do let me know if anyone has one.",
