      "post_content": "Nice circa 1943 Joe Dimaggio real photo postcard. Great sepia tone and simply one of the best action shots of the Yankee Clipper you can find. This was taken during his military service years in the midst of WWII. This is an extremely rare postcard and in better condition than typically found.\n\nI would prefer to trade this for some combination of a Wolverine News Sam Crawford portrait postcard and/or unusual Chief Bender postcards or other items.  I would also entertain cash offers. Contact me if you are interested.",
