The card is of the extremely rare \"spotted tie\" variety, which is amongst the most exotic and difficult to obtain Old Judge variations in existence.\n\nIf you have interest or any questions, please feel free to PM me or email me at: [url]info@t206society.com[/url].\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n\nDerek",
