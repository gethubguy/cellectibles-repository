      "post_content": "An exceptional real-photo postcard featuring the 1912 Boston Red Sox. This is one of the premier team postcards of the era in terms of production quality, photo clarity, and design. \n\nThe postcard pictures the Boston Red Sox in a classic team photo including Hall of Famer's Tris Speaker and Harry Hooper, and superstar pitcher Smokey Joe Wood. Each member of the club is identified in print on his image. \"Season 1912 - Champions Of The American League - Boston Red Sox\" appears in white letters below. \n\nThis card was produced by The Photo Art Shop of Swampsott, Massachusetts. There are no other team cards in the series, but one other real-photo Photo Art Shop baseball postcard (featuring Walter Johnson and Joe Wood shaking hands) is known to exist. The card (5-3/8 x 3-1/2 inches) has never been mailed. Very sharp-looking card. An outstanding example of a significant rarity commemorating the 1912 Red Sox championship season.\n\nSOLD!\n\nA graded one just sold on Ebay for ovr $1000\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/ULTRA-RARE-1912-BOSTON-RED-SOX-REAL-PHOTO-TEAM-POSTCARD-PSA-EX-5-/131476289660?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e9c98f87c&nma=true&si=vTKKKf74QjiqxKk4otn51tH5PCw%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557[/url]",
