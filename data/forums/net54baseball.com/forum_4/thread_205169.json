      "post_content": "Think this is the 1913 Rockford Wolverines club of the the WI-IL league (Class C).  \n\nForest Citys folded after 1871, their one year as a major league club - with Cap Anson and Spalding.  Some refer to the 1868-1870 teams as the Forest Citys as well, but they were an amateur team.  \n\nOnly other time Rockford had a \"Forest Citys\" team was 1895-1897 in the Western League.\n\nLove the card, and living close to Rockford, it's very cool to see.",
