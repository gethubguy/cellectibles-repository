      "post_content": "Based on the Kodak AZO stamp box this card, from the estate of Varney Anderson of the Old Judge set, can be dated to the period from 1904-1918. The team proudly sports the Orioles name on the jersey front. Aside from a slight stain in the background which is mentioned only for accuracy the card is in wonderful shape with a crisp image and a perfect back. --$250. Please email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url] if interested.",
