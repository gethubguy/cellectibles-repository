I would assume that trimming is the reason for the Scarlet Letter which changes everything. Given that, I think my bid makes sense.",

If you offer consulting services for cards please let me know so myself and others can ask your advice on what they should buy and they wouldn't lose money.

An SGC \"A\" sold in 2012 for $896.\n\nThis Ryan card has only two other examples known (one sold as part of a near complete set and presumably no longer available in the market).  I would assume, as a casual collector of these type of cards that this would be as valuable, if not more.  But I'm no expert.",
