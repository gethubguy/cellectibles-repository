      "post_content": "These two cards are nice low grade examples(my scanner makes cards look lighter as you can tell by the black on the SGC holders), with the Smith card(on hold) having great photo quality, but it's knocked down by a pinhole. O'Brien card is a popular outdoor pose knocked down by back damage. It was actually part of the Oregon Find from GFG about ten years back. sold the O'Brien, Smith is on hold. Paypal FF/Gift only please. Insured shipping is included.\n\nEdited to add: The Smith(on hold) sold in Legendary in Aug 2013 for $239. Link here has a better scan [url]http://www.legendaryauctions.com/1887_n172_old_judge_cigarettes__phenomenal__smith_-lot158743.aspx[/url]\n\nIf you're interested in the Smith, it is on hold until Friday, but feel free to call seconds just in case",
