This one came back as Altered  appears to have some sort of chemical or liquid damage to the left side, so not sure if that is what caused the non-grade.\n\nStill a tough card, PSA has only graded 2 of this particular and I am unsure on the SGC site as I cannot separate out by the various Silver Flint versions on their pop report.\n\nMuch like my other BST item for the CJ Leach, I will take offers on this one so please PM me if interested. \n\n[IMG]http://i626.photobucket.com/albums/tt347/Golfcollector/img669_zpstu9taknd.jpg[/IMG]",
