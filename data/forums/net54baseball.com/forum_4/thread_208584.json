I do not know their tendencies for grading N29 cards, so I do not know how they will view the left edge half way up to the top...where it looks like some sort of rubbing has happened. Hopefully the scan shows in in good detail. Please judge condition for yourself. Not taking the left edge into consideration, this is an EX-MT+ or NM card.\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains099/Scan_20150711_zpsb9inclo6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i792.photobucket.com/albums/yy203/collectiblesgains/collectiblesgains099/Scan_20150711%202_zpsntppsy3m.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAsking $925 delivered.\n\nTom C",
