      "post_content": "For sale is a circa 1890 cabinet by G Waldon Smith of Dan Brouthers. This is especially nice as it pictures Brouthers as a member of the Boston Players League team he played for. The players league lasted only one season so any items depicting the league are very tough to find. Graded SGC A due to clipped corners and name on front.    $4500 - PM to with any questions or to confirm. \n\nThanks\n\nChris",

      "post_content": "Chris--why do you assume that this is an 1890 image? Brouthers played for Boston in 1889 and 1891 also, and this uniform looks like the ones in the Walden Smith 1889 team photo(can be seen in Google images)? I'm not saying it isn't 1890, just wondering how one can be sure. BTW, the fact that the date is on the holder means nothing. SGC has no idea, they probably just copied what was on the submission form.\n\nThanks--Jay",
