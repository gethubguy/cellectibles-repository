      "post_content": "Hello, I would like to sell this N135 card.  This is \"No Game\", showing an umpire calling the game because of rain.\n\nThe Standard Catalog shows the measurements for this set at 2 1/2 x 4 1/8.  This one measures slightly over 2 1/4 by 4 1/8.  I don't see any evidence of trimming, so this may have came from the factory this way.\n\nIf you look closely you can see a vertical crease running the height of the card right over the gun case.\n\nSOLD\n\nThanks, Rick\n\nPlease send an email to [url]rickmcquillan@gmail.com[/url]",
