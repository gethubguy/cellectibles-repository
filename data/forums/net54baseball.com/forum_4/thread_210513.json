      "post_content": "I have four to sell -- maybe some more later -- all are SGC graded.  I'll be posting scans.  I'm a bit \"old school\" about OJs, i.e. I generally purchased them for the player and the image not the technical grade (so the backs aren't always great).  The prices listed included shipping with tracking but insurance is extra. Paypal is accepted without any surcharge.  \nAlso I apologize for the formatting of this posting.\n\nHere are the first four:\n491-1 August \"Gus\" Weyhing, Philadelphia AA SGC 20/1.5 (scrap book removal)  Won 264 games; Still the All-time leader in Hit-Batters at 277 \n\n457-1 \"Silent\" Mike Tiernan, NY Giants SGC 40/3; Slugger with .311 average over long career with NY Giants.\n\n\n502-6 Ed \"Ned\" Williamson  Chicago, SGC 60/5 considered by his contemporaries as an all time great, Williamson held the single season record HR record before Babe Ruth. \n331-3 TONY \"COUNT\" MULLANE , Cincinnati, Won 284 games and would have won 300 if not for a mid-career contract dispute that led to a year off the diamond. Also famously ambidextrous. \nFirst person to contact me at [url]bhodes@rcn.com[/url] gets the listed card. Thanks",
