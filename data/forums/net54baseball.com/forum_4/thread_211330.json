I would imagine I'm going to keep this thread updated over the years as I try to track down these pieces. Anything you have available please let me know. While I may not purchase everything today, I will keep everyone updated on my purchasing plans. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSteven\n\nPM or email, [url]shernan30@gmail.com[/url], anything you have available.\n\nN300 Mayo's Cut Plug\nCharlie Abby Washington\nJimmy Bannon Boston\n\nN284 Buchner Gold Coin\nBill Hart Milwaukee\n\n1898 Cameo Pepsin\nButtons Briggs Chicago\nJohn Grimm Brooklyn\nEdwin F.
