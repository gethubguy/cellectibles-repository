      "post_content": "I'm looking to purchase a few Old Judges.  In particular, I'm looking for one of Amos Rusie.  I realized recently that there are only 10 HOFers for which I don't own a single card (contemporary or vintage).  Rusie is one of them.  \n\nI'm also looking for a few other OJ HOFers as well  - Beckley, Clarkson, Duffy, Griffith, Mack, McCarthy, McPhee, and Nichols - but my priority is Rusie.\n\nI'm not a huge stickler for technical grades or overall condition (pinholes and creases are okay), but I do like my OJ's to have nice image clarity.\n\nIf you have any of those listed above and are looking to part ways with any of them, please contact me privately at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url].",
