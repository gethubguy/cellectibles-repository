      "post_content": "Interesting lot of 24 cards cut from one of the most iconic advertising pieces in the hobby! These cards were hand cut and glued into a scrapbook, from which I removed them. They are in excellent condition, with just a couple having paper loss on the backs. They are a slightly thinner paper stock than the regular issued cards, but thicker than regular paper.  The two poster corners are included in this auction as well. They measure 6.5\" tall x 5.5\" wide. $250 delivered. Paypal please. \n[URL=http://s1297.photobucket.com/user/jdl7860/media/ebay/IMG_20151004_0002_zpsyjnbfahb.gif.html][IMG]http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag29/jdl7860/ebay/IMG_20151004_0002_zpsyjnbfahb.gif[/IMG][/URL][URL=http://s1297.photobucket.com/user/jdl7860/media/ebay/IMG_20151021_0001_zpsevkuba1c.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag29/jdl7860/ebay/IMG_20151021_0001_zpsevkuba1c.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1297.photobucket.com/user/jdl7860/media/IMG_20151004_0003_zpswkhfoidw.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag29/jdl7860/IMG_20151004_0003_zpswkhfoidw.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1297.photobucket.com/user/jdl7860/media/IMG_20151004_0001_zpsitwc8m1f.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag29/jdl7860/IMG_20151004_0001_zpsitwc8m1f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
