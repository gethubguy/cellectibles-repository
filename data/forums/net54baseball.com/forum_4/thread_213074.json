But I know that these cards were also cut from advertising posters.  And my question is, \nDid the advertising-poster cards have the Allen & Ginter logo that appears on the N28's?\nIf so, can anyone tell the difference?\nOr, can this be confirmed as an N28?\n--Follow-up Note: This question has been answered below and elsewhere to my satisfaction.
