Regretting my snipe setting now - \n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nice-Victorian-Scrap-Die-Cut-Baseball-Player-Detroits-Detroit-No-Reserve-/181899271924[/url]\n\nI won the St.Louis, Boston and Pittsburg players if you would like to instead do a possible trade if this was a type-card buy.\n\n\nCard found and added to my Tigers type collection - Thanks Brad!",
