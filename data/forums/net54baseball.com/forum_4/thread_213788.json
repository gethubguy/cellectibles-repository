      "post_content": "Up for sale is a n172 Fred Mann and a MC Robinson. \n\nMann is ordinarily not a tough card.  However,  this is a very hard to find team change variation that \"portrays\" him as a member of the Hartfords team. \n\nCard has a stain of some sort, but has a really nice image. \n\nRobinson is more of a common player,  but has a good image despite its condition issues. \n\nMann is $400 obo\nRobinson is $85 OBO sold\n\nPlease send offers, questions, comments to [url]tlwise12@aol.com[/url]. \n\nThanks\nTravis",
