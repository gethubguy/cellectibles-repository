I can't find any info on this except for a similar button. Is it possible this was a button blank?  I did a black light test and it doesn't light up. The printing is also from the early 60s. Any help would be great.\n[URL=http://s36.photobucket.com/user/Perry-Bethany_Burtner-Chaney/media/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20141218_0001_zpszxo91kx5.jpg.html][IMG]http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e37/Perry-Bethany_Burtner-Chaney/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20141218_0001_zpszxo91kx5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
