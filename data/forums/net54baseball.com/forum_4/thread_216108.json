      "post_content": "Ed - nice wantlist :-)\n\nDoes that mean you have the other cards in each set you didn't list? I really need a decent Edwards from the N43 set as well as a few lower grade commons. I have a few of the cards you're missing in my lower grade set that I'd trade for something if you have anything I need (Barry, Ford, Myers, Ray). They are entrenched in my set otherwise. I also have Wood in an SGC 86 I'd like to move should you be interested in a condition rarity.\n\nI may have an N29 Paulsen - if I find it I'll lyk.\n\nAs for the BTA athletes I have some extras including the Hart card. They are packed but probably accessible. Think I need about 125. each except the Hart. Weston on my list as well - tough card!\n\nPlease don't start collecting Goodwin or Kimball champions - I'm having a hard enough time as it is :-)",
