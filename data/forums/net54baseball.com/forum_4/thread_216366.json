      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAvailable for sale are three CDV's by the Kimball Studio in Concord, New Hampshire, (which is from a collection that features quite possibly the first American ice hockey cards to feature uniformed players on skates). They feature unidentified players from the Saint Paul\u2019s School in New Hampshire, which makes a claim to having hosted the first ice hockey game in the United States on November 17, 1883.\n\nSGC has authenticated the cards but was unable to directly identify the players and believes they date to the 1890's. Early hockey cards of this nature are EXTREMELY RARE. Where CDVs exist, they most often show players out of uniform in street clothes. The CDV's have some writing and scrap book residue on the reverse but are in beautiful condition otherwise! PM or post if interested and thanks for looking.\n\nPrice is \"SOLD\". Prices include shipping, tracking & insurance from Canada.",
