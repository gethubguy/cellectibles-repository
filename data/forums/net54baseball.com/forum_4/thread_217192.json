His Boston cards are much easier to obtain than his Cleveland poses.  \n\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=28239[/IMG][IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=28240[/IMG]\n\nTintype - possibly a baseball player.  Its old, its a tintype, thats all I know.  Could be a player.  Could be just about any other profession.  Almost looks like home plate by his feet in background. $75 net to me delivered and you takes your chances.\n\nAlso willing to trade for other Old Judges or other cards on my wantlist.  Email with any questions.  Thanks for looking.  References and better scans available upon request.\n\nEric",
