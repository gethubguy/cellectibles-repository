I'd be happy to provide a scan to any interested parties. Price is $500 shipped, payable by check or PP gift. Yes, this is above VCP, but this is much nicer than your average 1 in my opinion. PM if interested. Thanks.\n\n[IMG]http://caimages.collectors.com/psaimages/3578/24440862/1895n300mdahlen1.jpg[/IMG]",
