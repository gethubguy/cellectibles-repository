Chas Bennett N28 Allen & Ginter's graded VGEX SGC 50.\n\nCard is in very nice shape with little wear. \n\nTwo PSA 4s sold on eBay recently - one for $330.00 and one for $256.00. I see no record for an SGC 50.\n\nI am asking [STRIKE]$275.00[/STRIKE] $250.00 for mine via PPFF. Looking to move this relatively quickly to pick up some other cards so if it does not move here, I will be listing it on eBay within a day or so.",
