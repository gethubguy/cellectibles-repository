      "post_content": "19th century Old Judge Cigarettes die cut advertisement. Colored along the front and dated on the lower left corner 1888, a comical scene of a young boy learning his lesson the hard way. \"TAKE THAT! AND THE NEXT TIME I SEND YOU TO THE STORE YOU'LL BRING ME THE OLD JUDGE AND NO OTHER KIND\" is what the kid is told and he receives a switch to the bottom. Along the top of the die cut the young boy rubs his back side as he tells the man behind the counter \"SAY B-B-BOSS GIMME OLD JUDGE AN NO FOLLIN THIS TIME\". Marked along the back side \"If you want a full photographic collection of your favorite BASE BALL PLAYERS YOU CAN EASILY GET THEM.\" Stamped \"WJ Deady Clyde NY\", there is overall wear with toning, edge wear and the two small tabs the top portion folds into are missing. It measures approx. 11-1/4\" tall by 9-1/4\" wide.  $70 net to me PAYPAL or check/money order.  Price includes first class USPS shipping.  Thanks.",
