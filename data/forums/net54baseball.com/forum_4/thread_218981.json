He only played for a few years before managing the rest of his career with Columbus, Pittsburgh, and Boston to name a few.\n\nPlaying Years:\n1884 Terre Haute\n1885 Toledo Avengers\n1887 Kalamazoo Kazoos\n\nI do have an N173 cabinet of Al so anything else out there showing him would be awesome to add to my collection. Thanks in advance.\n\nSteven\n\nPM or email, [url]shernan30@gmail.com[/url].",
