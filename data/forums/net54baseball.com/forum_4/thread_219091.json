If you don't get one here in the next few weeks/days/hours, I would strongly recommend one of the reputable Auction Houses.  They would likely offer you quite a sweet deal (% of the hammer price) to have that card in their auction!  It's an automatic marketing gold-mine for the Auction House, so you're doing them (and yourself) a favor by getting that card in front of as many people as you can.\n\nBest of luck with the sale!\n\nDerek",

I'm currently debating pursuing an eBay consignment seller versus pursuing an auction house.  eBay will obviously have a the largest audience, but the auction house will certainly have the right audience so I'm still exploring my options.
