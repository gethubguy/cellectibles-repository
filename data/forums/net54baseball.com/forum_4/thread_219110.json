      "post_content": "Selling off several N-cards to help fund some other purchases. Only listing these here briefly before moving to eBay.\n\nPhotos shown below of these N28 Allen & Ginter cards. All backs correspond exactly with the fronts (i.e. the Clarkson has some paper loss as pictured while the Caruthers does not). If you have any questions about fronts/backs, don't hesitate to ask. My scans are also not the greatest so if you need a better description of any particular card, just let me know.\n\nI went for high-appeal cards with clean fronts so these look tremendous (to me). Several came to me slabbed so I cannot guarantee this but I do not see any creases to any of them.\n[STRIKE]\nClarkson SGC 10[/STRIKE] - SOLD\n\n[STRIKE]Comiskey SGC A[/STRIKE] - SOLD\n\nKeefe SGC A - Incredibly clean front and back, only trimmed. No creases. ($175.00)\n\n[STRIKE]Glasscock SGC 10 [/STRIKE]- SOLD\n\nMulvey SGC 10 - Gorgeous card that is crease free. Some paper loss on back but pretty clean. ($150.00)\n\n[STRIKE]Caruthers SGC 10 [/STRIKE]- SOLD\n\nI will also have some N29s, N162s, and N172s listed shortly.",
