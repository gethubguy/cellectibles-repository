These are lower-grade cards as evidenced in the picture. Flaws include some creasing, trimming, paper loss/addition, etc. If you need more information on any if the picture is not unclear, just let me know and I'll be happy to describe any individual card.\n\nThe lot includes: Gus Hill, FF Ives, Edwin Bibby, James Albert, Patsey Kerrigan, Hugh McCormack, CW V Clarke, JC Daly, EC Carter, LE Myers, William O'Connor, WB Page, Alex Paulsen, Thomas Pettitt, CAJ Queckberner, WG George, Duncan Ross, William Rowe, Billy Edwards, and Fred Wood.\n\nThe Paulsen is generally considered a key card in the set. I no longer have a VCP subscription, but my guess is that the VCP pricing on these in poor condition is significantly higher than my asking price.\n\nNot selling individually - only as a group.",
