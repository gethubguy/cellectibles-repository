      "post_content": "Sold and getting a lower end Hamilton as well. Perfect solution if you have to sell.\nThis was my white whale but circumstances are causing me to sell it. It is one of the three highest graded by SGC.\nAsking $2150 which is what I paid for it (price and buyer's premium) from auction last year.\nIf you have a lower end graded Billy Hamilton I would entertain partial trade and paypal. My desire for a N172 Hamilton is still strong but willing downgrade in order to get some funds.",
