The back says this postcard is from Hot Springs Arkansas.  All of the corner tips are creased and there is scrapbook paper and glue residue on the back.  I am looking for 350.00 or best offer for this postcard.  Please let me know if you are interested, have any questions, or need better scans.\n\nThanks,\nAlan\n[url]aelefson@hotmail.com[/url]",
