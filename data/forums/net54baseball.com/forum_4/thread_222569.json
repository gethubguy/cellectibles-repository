But boy I'm lucky as heck.\nPlaying baseball, away on trips and doing my studies and am going to graduate and fixing to get away early so I can go to Joplin about June 4th. Will tell you we about myself when I see and will write later. Drop me a card now and then. \nPete\"\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m235/bjk721/8fb6ab710d0ad7ff7a9acd38be8e5e4b_zps9e805ed3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m235/bjk721/df777d74e7a8a7dc9e794a2e1e3188e1_zps24efc25a.jpg[/IMG]\n\n$850 obo",
