      "post_content": "Updated 8 December 2024. Looking to purchase 1962 Ford Detroit Tiger postcards. I need the following:\nDick Brown\nPhil Cavaretta\nJack Homel\nMike Roarke\n\nI wrote Terry Fox asking him when these were taken? He said a Ford representative grabbed a bunch of players and posed them along side a Ford automobile during Lakeland FL spring training. Mr. Fox even sent me a signed postcard of himself.\n\nI alway's wondered with Al Kaline and Norm Cash were not included in this set.\n\nThanks for looking\nJim",
