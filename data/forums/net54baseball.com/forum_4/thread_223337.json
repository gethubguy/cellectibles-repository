      "post_content": "Jon- I sure got excited when I saw the title, but unfortunately, the flip is incorrect in that it is Harry Lyons, not Denny, holding the bat.  \n\nBBR lists Harry Lyons has playing a single game for the Philadelphia NL team in 1887 and is listed as an outfielder.\n\nMeanwhile, Denny Lyons played third base for the Philadelphia team in the American Association in 1887.\n\nI'm looking for the Denny Lyons fielding pose card from the Zalamazoo Bats set:\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=233206&d=1464675066[/IMG]\n\nGreat card though - Good Luck.\n\n\nFYI- My interest in Denny Lyons is that he played on the very first Professional team based in my hometown of Columbus, GA and was the first of those players (1885 Columbus Stars) to get to the majors.\n\n\n\n.",
