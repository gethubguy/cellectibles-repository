      "post_content": "I've got two decent Old Judges available for trade or sale.\n\n1887 card of Fogarty is off-center from left to right and has a blob from the manufacturing process that partially obscures his name on the name/position/team line. Otherwise is in nice shape - good image, no back damage. $150sold\n\n1889 card of Faatz is a nice image, well centered, and well graded. He is referred to as \"Captain\" in both the name/position/team line at the bottom and the hand-written info in the image. No back damage. $275sold\n\n$400 for the pair. \n\nWould gladly entertain trades for similarly conditioned Old Judge cards of players I do not already have. \n\nEmail me at [url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url].",
