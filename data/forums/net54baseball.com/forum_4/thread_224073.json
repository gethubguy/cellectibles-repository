      "post_content": "Offered for trade or sale is a 1906 New York Highlanders foldout schedule postcard.  It is scored for the August 23, 1906 Cleveland vs. New York game which is reflected on the schedule and in which Orth did indeed beat Townsend 3-1. It is also postmarked 1906 from New York.\n\nDepicted are images of HOFers Keeler, Chesbro and Johnson.  Also depicted is Hal Chase in his second year in the Majors.\n\nA very nice piece and a quite scarce postcard.  \n\nI am interested in trading for the Wolverine News Sam Crawford portrait postcard, the Chief Bender Rose Company postcard or the H.M. Taylor Tiger postcards of Donovan, the Floral Horseshoe and Coughlin, but  I am always interested in Chief Bender items or other Deadball postcards.  \n\nIf you opt for the purchase option the price is $xxxx shipped and insured, regular Paypal is fine.",
