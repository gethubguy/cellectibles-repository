As I'm not certain I'm selling this card -- as was with the Hubel I recently sold -- make your best offers.  \n\nEdited to add: if you don't hear back from me, it is fair to presume that your offer is at most 50% of the highest offer I presently have. \n\n\n[URL=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/calvindog/3019102393/in/album-72157607702362661/\"][IMG]https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3195/3019102393_a3ff2c0f8e_o.jpg[/IMG][/URL]<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>",
