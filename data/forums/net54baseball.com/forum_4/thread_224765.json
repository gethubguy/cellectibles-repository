      "post_content": "Great ad for Old Judge and Gypsy Queen Cabinet Photographs on back. \"Copyrighted 1888\" imprinted in lower left corner.\n\nMeasures 3.75 inches wide by 7.25 tall when opened.  You can see vintage tape residue where the fold up piece was separated and reattached.  \nThere is a piece of not-so-vintage clear tape holding it together now.\nNo paper loss on the back...the whiter area just didn't age like the rest of it.\n\nAsking [STRIKE]$50[/STRIKE] $40, ppd.   PM or email if interested.\n\n[URL=http://s997.photobucket.com/user/jtorsiello/media/N54%20Baseball/Old_Judge_Advertising_Card_zps2qas0fij.jpg.html][IMG]http://i997.photobucket.com/albums/af98/jtorsiello/N54%20Baseball/Old_Judge_Advertising_Card_zps2qas0fij.jpg[/IMG][/URL]  [URL=http://s997.photobucket.com/user/jtorsiello/media/N54%20Baseball/Old_Judge_Advertising_Card_Back_zpsauiid2ir.jpg.html][IMG]http://i997.photobucket.com/albums/af98/jtorsiello/N54%20Baseball/Old_Judge_Advertising_Card_Back_zpsauiid2ir.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
