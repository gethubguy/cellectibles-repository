I don't know how rare this is, but I have not been able to find another image of a Gleason Brown's Champions with the Copyright line.  \n\nCardtarget has 5 different copies, none with the copyright line.  The copies used in the Old Judge book don't have it.  The random google images I scanned through all are missing this line.\n\nThe negative about the card is that it is rebacked.  SGC said they would start holdering rebacked cards, but I haven't had a reason to send it back in just to have it holdered as Authentic.\n\n$550 net to me\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k607/bn2cardz/PreWar/n172gleason005-01_zpsptyaitfg.jpg[/IMG]",
