PSA graded Authentic, the image on this card is beautiful (I apologize for the scan, it a much more clear image in hand), with the back being as clean as the front.  One of two graded by PSA, while SGC show only two Cleveland cards graded, without reference to which of the three poses they are.  A truly scarce card, I am looking for [STRIKE]$500 obo[/STRIKE] PENDING on this card.  Price is  net  to me, I  accept PP friends and family, or for  Regular PP please add 3%  to  cover fees. Card will  ship upon   receipt of cleared payment.   Shipping is included.  Thanks for looking.\n\nFirst firm commitment to buy, via PM, e-mail, or post here will trump negotiations.
