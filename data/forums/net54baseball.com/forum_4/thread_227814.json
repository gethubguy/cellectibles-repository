      "post_content": "I am looking to buy a Cuban Postcard from March 1940 featuring the St. Louis Cardinals playing in Cuba for the preseason.  The postcard says:\n\nObsequio de RHC Cadena Azul \nRecuerdo\nde la visita a la Habana del \"San Luis\" - Cardenales \nMarzo - 1940\n\nI've attached a few photos of the postcard that I am looking to buy.  The images came from google images and I used them without consent of the owner O.O\n\nIf anyone has a similar postcard, then please contact me.  Any condition will be accepted.",

      "post_content": "I am also interested in the official souvenir program that goes with the postcard from the event.  I am interested in the program from any day.  The cover of the program is not the same for each game played.  If anyone has the program, please contact me.\n\nThe Cardinals also visited Cuba in March of 1936...I am also interested in the program from 1936; however, my preference leans towards the programs from 1940 because I do not think a postcard was made for 1936 as I've never have seen one myself.  Unless someone else has seen a postcard from 1936, please show me a picture of it ^.^",
