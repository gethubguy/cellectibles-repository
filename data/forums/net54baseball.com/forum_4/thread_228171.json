      "post_content": "I have a nice looking N300 Amos Rusie wanting a new owner. This is the version with the Hoosier Thunderbolt's name misspelled \"RUSSIE.'\n\nThe card has never been graded, but if it was, I suspect it would receive only an Authentic grade because it looks to me like the upper right and lower left corners might have had a touch of Magic Marker applied. There are also two small tack or pin holes - an obvious one above his head (which does not impact his image directly nor does it detract terribly from the overall appearance) and one hardly noticeable one above his name right on the bottom button on his jersey. There is also a small wrinkle in the upper right corner. Otherwise it is a decent enough card of this tough HOFer and without the Magic Marker would likely grade Fair to Good.\n\nAsking [STRIKE]$600[/STRIKE] $475 firm or will trade for Old Judge cards of players I do not already have.",
