This cabinet is now housed in an SGC 10 slab to protect it. I have never seen another proof with the Goodwin copyright written into the physical card, nor have I seen another Columbus proof. \n\nThis card is SOLD. \n\n[IMG]http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m294/madjams/N173Proof_zpsbb46047a.jpg[/IMG]",
