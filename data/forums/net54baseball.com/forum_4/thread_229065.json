      "post_content": "------------- SOLD --------------\n\nUp for sale here is a Bob Caruthers N162 1888 Goodwin Champions. Solid color and the card is in nice shape. I was hoping this would land an SGC 10 grade, but it was given Authentic - I'm guessing because of the significantly rounded lower corner. \n\nVery faint wrinkling/creasing across middle but no writing, significant paper loss, etc. This looks very much like a 10 or even 20 to me.\n\nBrand new holder. Scratches on images are on my scanner.",
