      "post_content": "Amusing postcard from right after the 1907 World Series sweep by the Chicago Cubs over the Detroit Tigers featuring a beat up tiger in a coffin with the words \"From the Cubs with regrets\". At top is printed \"Died October- \"07 Clubbed to Death Too Bad\". VG condition postcard has been used with a postmark date of 1909. Age toning thru out. Some minor creasing. Looks much better in person! \n\nSorry about the bad scan :(\n\n$300 Lower States.. FREE SHIPPING.. paypal FF",
