I'm looking for a N284 Buchner Gold Coin Hart (Milwaukee Pitcher).\n\nI prefer ungraded (and would be likely to crack a graded one out of the case).  I am open to any grade or raw though as this guy has eluded me for some time now.  Let me know if you have it or have seen it anywhere!\n\nThanks!\n\n[IMG]http://www.oldcardboard.com/n/n284/070.jpg[/IMG]",
