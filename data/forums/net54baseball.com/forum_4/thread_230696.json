If it was up to Lisa, she would just give you the items as she likes you a lot!   It must be because you have a way with \"words\".  I need to go re watch Finding Forrester.   \n\nI tried buying Jerrys HOF Rose PCs when he listed on this same BST around 2AM.   I replied within 6 minutes of the listing to later find out they were sold to someone else who beat me, and didn't post on the thread.  So, glad to have been here at the right time and I thought the price was right inline with \"market pricing\" if not slightly better!",
