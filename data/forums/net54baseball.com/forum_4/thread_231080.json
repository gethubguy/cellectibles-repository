      "post_content": "The image must date from either 1909 or 1910.  The second player from the right in the middle row is first baseman Tom Jones, who was obtained in a trade with the Browns on August 20th, 1909, and remained with the team through the 1910 season.  The home uniform was the same in 1909 and 1910, and many of the same players who were with the team in the 1909 World Series were still on the team in 1910, so it's hard to determine exactly which year the picture was taken.",

      "post_content": "Many consider the Team Card as a \"stand alone\" card and not part of the Dietsche 1907-09 Series. Others believe it belongs to the set issued in 1909. If it was issued for the 1909 World Series then it appears to be part of the set, if issued in 1910 maybe a stand alone postcard. I don't believe anyone has determined for sure if it was issued with the Third Year or Series of Postcards. If anyone has evidence please email.\nWhen I listed the PSA Registry set , I included the team card as part of the set, but not sure if that is right.   Thanks Mike",

      "post_content": "There was a fantastic article about this set written by Robert Silverman in OldCardboard (issue #8 2006) entitled: \"1907-1909 (PC 765) Dietsche Postcards: The Gateway to Pre-War PC Collecting.\"\nAnd boy, was that title correct. The Dietsche was definitely my gateway drug. Here are three great images from the article. One image (upper left) is of the envelope which contained the 15 cards in the 1907 Dietsche Tigers set. Next to it is a photo of an ad which shows the 15 cards. The \"fielding\" Cobb was released later that Year, and was presumably not in the original set of 15.  At the bottom is a great image of the store in Detroit where these cards were sold by Mr. Dietsche himself.\nI know this post shouldn't be in BST, but since we were on the topic, i thought I would share.",
