      "post_content": "I got this card a while back in a trade and it just doesn't fit my collection, despite how cool it is. Presents very well....honest, even corner wear and no creases. Asking [STRIKE]$300[/STRIKE]  [STRIKE]$225[/STRIKE]  $200\nI'd also trade for T205s or a T3 I don't have.\n\nedited to add: I didn't realize how much my scanner sucks until right now and I apologize. Focus on the card is perfect and that strange mark on his right leg from the thigh to the knee is on the slab and practically invisible in hand.",
