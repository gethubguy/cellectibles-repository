      "post_content": "I have this 1889 Buck Ewing N29 for sale.  I purchased the card from REA back in 2013 and it was a PSA 2.    I thought the card was way undergraded as I couldn't see anything major wrong with it to be a 2 in my eyes (if I remember correctly, REA said it had been removed from a scrapbook and had a small tear on the back paper from the removal, I suppose that's why it was downgraded to a 2 originally) so I played the crack and resubmit game by sending it to the National with a hobby friend and this time the graders at PSA gave it an AUTH. (I think they told him they thought the small tear had been \"pressed\" whatever the hell that means)      A beautiful card as far as eye appeal. \n\nEDIT TO ADD:  Now that I see the scan on my 32 inch monitor here at work instead of my 4 inch phone display, I think I can see why it graded a 2 initially.  Looks like paper loss on the upper right of the back where the S should be in Champions and perhaps along that border.   Wish I could have seen that BEFORE I cracked it out of the 2 holder as it would never gotten above a 2 if that's the case, and I wouldn't have cracked and resubmitted. \n\nThe joys of being mid forties and having declining vision LOL\n\nStill a beautiful card eye appeal wise and should be a 2 IMHO and not an  AUTH.\n\nMike\n\nI'm asking $950     Here are scans of it as it existed in the PSA 2 holder BEFORE I cracked it out, and the scans of how it exists NOW, in the PSA AUTH holder.\n\nOnce again, it is now in the AUTH holder, not the 2, just posting those to show the lineage of the card.  It's a 2 for REA, and an AUTH for me lol, gotta love it.     See closeup scan of the area from an image I had saved back when I bought it.\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/ewingfront_zpsef428e43.jpg[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/ewingback_zps40c815e1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img1513_zps7f7c66ff.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img355_zpsrazecypt.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab239/thenavarro/img356%202_zpsc6kx80ci.jpg[/IMG]",

I hate having to sink more money in it, but that's a great suggestion if they'll do it\n\nM",
