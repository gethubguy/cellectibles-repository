      "post_content": "I was going through my storage unit recently and in a box of old comic books, I found three m101-6 Felix Mendelsohn cards I was given by my Grandmother when I was young. I was in the 6th grade when I first got them and at the time, no baseball card shop I took them to had ever seen them. I knew that they had to be rare and valuable. Here I am, 27 years later, just finding that I owned them again. Thanks to the internet, it took no time at all to get info. The cards I have are Walter Johnson, Tris Speaker, and Jim Bagby. They're all in low to mid-grade condition. I was offered $2500 by a reputable consignment outfit. Does that seem low?",
