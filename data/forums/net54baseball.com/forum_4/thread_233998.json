Is the back a repro and the front is original? or something else?[/QUOTE]\n\nThe first thing you said. An Old Judge consists of a thin albumen photograph glued to a piece of cardboard. Sometimes, the photograph gets separated from the original cardboard, in which case the thin photograph is referred to as a \"skinned\" OJ. If somebody glues that thin phototo a modern piece of cardboard, that's a \"rebaked\" OJ.",

      "post_content": "Hi David -\n\nI concur with most of what you said.  Many OJs, however are actually rebacked with the cardboard backing of less desireable OJs or other 19th Century cards.\n\nI purchased this card as is so do not know whether the backing is vintage or more modern.  If I recall, the backing has to be relatively similar to the originals to even get a grade from SGC.",
