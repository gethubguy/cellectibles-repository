Paypal f/f preferred.\n\nThanks for looking!\nDerek\n\nedited to add the following:\nIt looks like there is some sort of mark on the left part of the Supplement.  It does not appear to be a pencil marking, but does look more like some sort of scratch from a metal object rubbing against it.  Someone did write \"230\" on the back in pencil.  Updated scans have been posted below\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1899%20Clarke1.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1899%20Clarke%20_back_1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1899%20Clarke%20_close-up2_1.jpg[/IMG]",

I always believed it to be Clarke's earliest collectible until I came across a pretty cool Cabinet card of his from 1898, which is now in my collection.\n\nThat said, the M101-1 is still listed on the oldcardboard.com website as the earliest collectible of Mr. Clarke.",
