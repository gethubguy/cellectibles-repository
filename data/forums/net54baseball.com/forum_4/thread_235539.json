Certainly a candidate for the \"buy the card, not the holder\" philosophy.\n\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee76/seablaster/IMG_20170217_0010_zpsifgqfcdc.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee76/seablaster/IMG_20170217_0009_zpsyf3wkzh2.jpg[/IMG]",
