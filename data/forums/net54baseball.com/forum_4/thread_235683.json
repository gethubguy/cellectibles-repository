Postcard is normal postcard size and has some creasing as can be seen (and some that can't be seen). It is actually a bit darker in person than it is on the screen here. Really nice contrast and focus in person too, better than the scanner did. $no longer for sale\n\n\nGame 6  Sunday, October 14, 1906.
