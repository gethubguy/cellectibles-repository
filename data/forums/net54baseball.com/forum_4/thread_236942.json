      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\nAvailable for sale is a 1917-19 Fritz Mollwitz (Pittsburgh Pirates) Real Photo Postcard. This postcard was postally used and has some writing on the front but it does not detract from the overall image. Postcard was mailed in 1921, but Fritz played with the Pirates from 1917-19. Probably a one of a kind! Price is $250 including shipping tracking and insurance from Canada. PM or post if interested and thanks for looking.\nJeff",
