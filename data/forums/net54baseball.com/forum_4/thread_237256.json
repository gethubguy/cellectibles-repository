      "post_content": "** SOLD **\n\nHi. Exceedingly rare 1889 N172 Old Judge Harry Wright HOF card. Portrait looking right variation.\n\nHarry Wright is often referred to as the \"Father of Professional Baseball.\" He was instrumental in helping transform the game from a weekend activity for amateurs, to an organized league of professional clubs. He is credited with many innovations, including the use of hand signals, as well as devising an intricate scoring system to keep track of games and statistics. In late 1868, Wright was chosen by the owners of the Cincinnati Red Stockings club to head baseball's first salaried, all-professional team. He assembled an unbeatable team which went undefeated in 57 club matches in 1869. Wright would continue to manage some of the best teams in the game for the next 25 years. \n\nThe card is condition challenged with fading, chipping, and creasing evident. Hi-res scans provided for your consideration.\n\nAccepting reasonable offers. Payment to be made by PayPal friends and family or personal check only.\n\nFeel free to email or pm me direct with any questions. Email address is [url]teza11@cox.net[/url].\n\nJeff",

      "post_content": "Hi. This has been an interesting process to say the least.  I thought I'd share what has happened since my posting to see if other \"listers\" have experienced similar results (or the lack thereof) on this site.\n\nWithin days of my listing I received somewhere between 5-10 offers on the card.  They ranged from $200 on the low end to close to $900 on the high end.  After a couple days I sent notice to the high bidder accepting his offer and asking how he intended to complete payment.  His response was something to the effect of \u201cMy offer has expired\u201d.  I told him that I wasn\u2019t aware that he had given me an expiration date.  He came back to say that \"he did not want me to use his offer against him\u201d.  I\u2019m not sure how that would work since I never asked him to raise or change his original offer.  Unfortunately I turned down a couple other solid offers based on this guy\u2019s offer.\n\nSo I circle back to the next remaining best offer.  Guy 2 goes through the motions of what are my payment options (even though I clearly stated that in my listing), asks for new conditions i.e. \u201cWill you give my money back if it does not grade at least Auth?\u201d\u2026I agreed, and then even more \u201cI\u2019m busy with work\u201d delays in sending payment.  The next pm I get says, \u201cI\u2019m still deciding if I want to buy the card\u201d.  Shouldn\u2019t that decision have be made before making me an offer?  Maybe it\u2019s just me.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s been interesting and has left me wondering how many flaky buyers are lurking on this site.  Have you experienced something similar?\n\nAs for the card, I\u2019ve decided to move it over to eBay.\n\nJeff",
