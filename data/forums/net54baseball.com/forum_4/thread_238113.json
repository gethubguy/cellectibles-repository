      "post_content": "1914 rppc showing Braves manager Johnny Evers fighting the Washington Senators and Clark Griffith (and others) trying to calm him down. Evers was known for his temper and great shot of the two Hall of Famers facing off during the Miracle Braves and Evers' MVP-winning season.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/sale/misc/1914%20Evers%20vs%20Ainsmith.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAdding even more to the postcard is the fact that it was also later mailed to and owned by Senators shortstop George McBride who is pictured to the left of Evers. Great baseball content discussing teammates of McBride.\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/sale/misc/1915%20Evers%20vs%20Griffith%20back.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPerhaps the coolest and most unique postcard that I've ever seen. SOLD (a million dollars)\n\nDetails of the day below (April 10, 1914)\n\n[IMG]http://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/sale/misc/Evers%20and%20Ainsmith%20fight.jpg[/IMG]",
