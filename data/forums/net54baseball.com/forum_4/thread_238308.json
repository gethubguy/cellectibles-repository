      "post_content": "Hey everyone, new guy to the forum here. My name is Brad and I started collecting cards as a kid in the late 80's. As a 30 year old I got back in to the hobby going back and buying the cards I always wanted as a kid but could never afford. Since then my interest in the hobby has grown and so has the collection. Learning more about vintage has really grown my interest also. I recently completed the topps master set of Ernie Banks with the purchase of the 54 Banks.  I also collect any and all versions of Frank Chance I can find/afford too. \n\nAs a cubs fan I've started searching for an \"affordable\" version of an N28 Cap Anson. Preferably a low graded (sgc, psa, bvg) version of the card.  \n\nWas wondering if anyone had one they are willing to part with or know of anyone willing to part with one?\n\nThanks,\n\nBrad\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
