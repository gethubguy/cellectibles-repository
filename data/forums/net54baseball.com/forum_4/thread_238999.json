      "post_content": "I have two extremely scarce items for trade. Although I am inclined to keep them, the right trade offer from my want list could induce me to let one or both go. I have found that rare items are the best leverage to pry other rare items loose from fellow collectors.\n\nFirst I have a 1907 Dietsche Ty Cobb Fielding postcard. It is much tougher than the batting Cobb from the same series. It is postmarked in 1913 and references back to 1907 in the handwritten correspondence on the reverse.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=271295&d=1493481900[/IMG]   [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=271296&d=1493481920[/IMG]\n\nI also have a 1915-20 Baseball Stars Notebook featuring Babe Ruth. This is the exact one shown on Old Cardboard's website which lists it as one of the Ruth \"Rookies\". While I believe it is most likely circa 1918, it is still a rare early Ruth item with superb display possibilities. I have only seen one other for sale almost ten years ago and it was in much lesser condition. Much tougher than the Cobb notebook from the same series, which is understandable given it was published towards the back end of the 1910-1920 run for this series. In nice shape with minor flaws as shown and a child's lessons written in many of the interior pages.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=271297&d=1493482020[/IMG]   [IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=271298&d=1493482045[/IMG]\n\nMy Want List is as follows:\n\nChief Bender Rose Company postcard\nAny Bender RPPC\nBender Lincoln Publishing postcard\nAny Bender Type 1 photo, particularly by Paul Thompson\nJuly 1914 Detroit at Boston program/scorecard\nSam Crawford Rose Company postcard\nCrawford Detroit Free Press postcard\nCrawford Topping postcard\nCrawford 1908 Dietsche postcard (has his name on front)\nChristy Mathewson 1910-1920 Base Ball Stars notebook\nH.M. Taylor postcards of Donovan batting, Donovan Floral Horseshoe and Coughlin\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in making a trade.",
