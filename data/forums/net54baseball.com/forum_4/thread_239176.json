That said, I am new to the hobby, as it relates to Pre-WWII baseball postcards. I have gone as far as I could, down the road of homework on trying to ID these teams, and have only been able to establish the one team - 1906 Reading Pretzels, in part of course, because of \"Home Run\" Baker.\n\nCan anyone provide assist on the ID of the other teams \"E\" and \"RM\" or \"MR\" - I would assume, since these cards were auctioned together, that both teams are part of the Tri-State league - and were located in Pennsylvania, etc, but the E does not represent the Erie Sailors, as near as I can tell, and I have no idea as to the other. Baseball-reference.com of course has extensive listings of all the teams of that era, and none seem to match up to these initials.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated.\n\nMark",

Also, if you can additionally post larger individual scans it will help everybody to pull out some details of the photos.\n\nRob M",
