      "post_content": "25 years ago my father and I built the N29 set (-minus most of the baseball players) and as our interests changed, we sold the cards off as a group.....well, now I'd like to put this set back together starting from scratch. I also realize that the NM Wrestlers aren't 10.00 anymore, but let me know what ya have.\n\nIf anyone has any N29 cards that they are looking to sell, please email me at:\n[url]tuxman829@aol.com[/url]. Scans would be great, and have a rough idea of what you're looking to get. \n\nI also posted this in the Non-Sports section of the BST as well. Hope that's cool.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBob Hamlin",
