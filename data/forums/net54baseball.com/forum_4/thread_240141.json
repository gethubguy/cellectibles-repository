Please email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url] if you have an interest in any of these. I would trade for other Old Judges, Gypsy Queens,  Whitehead and Hoag Pins or M101-4/5 type cards of HOFers. Note: three cards on right had SGC grade cut off by image--All are \"A\". Virtually all Minis are given an \"A\" and the Alcott-Mansfield card has corner clips.\n\nThanks--Jay",
