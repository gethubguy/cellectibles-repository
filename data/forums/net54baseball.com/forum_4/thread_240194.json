      "post_content": "25 years ago my father and I built the N29 set (-minus most of the baseball players) and as our interests changed, we sold the cards off as a group.....well, now I'd like to put this set back together starting from scratch.\n\nIf anyone has any N29 cards that they are looking to sell, please email me at:\n[url]tuxman829@aol.com[/url]. Scans would be great, and have a rough idea of what you're looking to get. Cards don't need to be baseball players or in high grade.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBob Hamlin",
