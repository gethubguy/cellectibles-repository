There is a total population of 6 on that Matthewson (4 sgc and 2 psa), and that is assuming none were crossed over. If anyone collects matthewson, they need to jump all over this card or wait another 8 years to find it. I suspect that the same mad-stapler who owned your Matthewson once owned my Cobb below. Even the sgc serial numbers are nearly sequential.",

I would think that the \"right buyer\" would be a guy who collects Matty and wants an awesome, and impossibly rare card of his. Good luck with the sale.",
