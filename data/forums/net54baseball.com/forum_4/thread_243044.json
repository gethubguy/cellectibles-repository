      "post_content": "I am interested in buying a postcard or photo of Ty Cobb in his Detroit uniform when he played one or more games with the Otsego baseball team.  Cobb played one or more games for the team (approx. 1914) and I have seen both postcards and photos of the team with Cobb in his Detroit uniform in the middle of the photo.  I would like an original of the card or photo for a reasonable price but I am interested in a good scan of the photo.  I am not a collector but a Ty Cobb/Detroit fan and love the photo and would like display a larger version of the photo for decorative purposes in my office.  I have family that settled early in Otsego so the photo is interesting to me for several reasons.  [url]postemam@ferris.edu[/url]",
