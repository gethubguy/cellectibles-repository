      "post_content": "Up for sale is an original Allen & Ginter advertising poster for Richmond Straight Cut Cigarettes.  The poster is circa 1887-88.  Overall its got great eye appeal, with bold colors that pop.  However, there is some damage on the left side as pictured, mainly due to what appears to be water stains, etc.  I also believe the poster has been mounted at some point (I don't believe the cardboard backing is original, although it's also very old).\n\nSize of the poster, itself, is roughly 17.5\" by 28.5\".\n\nSOLD",
