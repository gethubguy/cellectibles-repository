I'm healthy but the prospect of facing the next \"milestone\" is uncomfortable. Please help to put me out these two sets to rest before people do so to me!! At least getting the SINGLE CARD I need to finish my first set would make a statement. :-) I'm most likely to overpay for the last card I need in a set.\n\nmissing first set:\n\nEdwards\n\nreplacements (for trade or straight sale):\n\nryan (replace psa 3)\nwood (downgrade from sgc 86)\n\nmissing second set (lower grade - minor wear & bd ok):\n\npettitt\ntemple\nedwards\nqueckenberner\nlablanche\ncummings\nf murphy\n(duffy)\n(boyton)\n(slocum)",
