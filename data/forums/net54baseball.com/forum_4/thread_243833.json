I did look up VCP which was pointless for the most part as most prices were 8-10 years old.\n\nLines are a reflection not on the card\n\nTom Deasley - SGC A - 121F\nJimmy Ryan - SGC 2 - 404D - Sold\nAbner Dalrymple - SGC 3 - 113-2A - Sold\n\nWhat ever we agree on is dlvd PP friends and family.\n\nPM if interested.",
