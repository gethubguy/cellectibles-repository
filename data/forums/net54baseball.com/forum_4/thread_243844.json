      "post_content": "Just picked up this ultra rare cabinet card. Very rough but still unbelievably awesome! \n\nTomlinson Cabinet. Bottom says:\n\nDetroit Base Ball Club 1887\nChampions of the League\n\nfeaturing cameo portraits of fourteen team members, including Hall of Famers Dan Brouthers, Sam Thompson, and Ed Hanlon. Each player is identified in small type beneath his portrait.                                              \n\nTaking offers.  (will post front/back pics on Monday) \n\nCan forward images to any email.",

      "post_content": "\"Champions of the League\" Tomlinson cabinet fairly common but more than enough demand to keep them valuable.  Bryan Dec also has an example on eBay for $6250.\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.com/itm/rare-1887-DETROIT-WOLVERINES-NL-CHAMPIONS-BASEBALL-TEAM-CABINET-PHOTO-CARD-/253093859115?hash=item3aed91cf2b:g:nwcAAOSwMtxXvIkd[/url]\n\nI have a couple authentic copies and a fake.  I know a fake was also received by an auction house awhile back.  In both cases, the fakes were not particularly well done.\n\n(EDIT/UPDATE)  Saw image of front and back, looks real to me.  It is among the roughest example in the hobby, but a nice cabinet.",
