      "post_content": "One of very few known.  Also one of Matty's first cards as well as the very first postcard to show a major league baseball team.\n\nPhoto used for the real-photo postcard is by the famed Ben Falk whose studio was on the top floor of the Waldorf Astoria hotel.  I'll also include an original program from the opening of the Waldorf that shows a larger pic of his studio as well as the empty staircase where the Giants would later pose.\n\nGreat piece of baseball and New York history and one of the top postcards in the hobby.  Taking serious offers... (interesting trades also considered)\n\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/sale/sale/large/1903%20Giants.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/sale/sale/websize/Waldorf%20back.jpg[/IMG]",
