It is postmarked June 29, 1913 and Chicago played against the Cleveland Green Sox managed by Cy Young in Cleveland at Luna Park on the 28th and 29th according to the newspapers. \nThe uniform matches the road uniform for Chicago in 1913. If you enlarge the photo you can see the pinstripes and the left point of the \u201cC\u201d, particularly on the player at far right which might be Burt Keeley the manager and team namesake, based on the photo below. I\u2019m assuming the park would be the baseball field at Luna Park amusement park, but can\u2019t find any photos of the Luna Park field as they and Federal League photos in general are so hard to find. Also attached is a known photo of the 1913 Chicago Federals. 1913 Federal League photos, not to mention RPPCs, are almost impossible to find.\n\nSOLD shipped.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=287171&d=1504967577[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=287168&d=1504967482[/IMG]",
