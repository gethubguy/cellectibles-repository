I think it may be best if I gave more detail regarding trades.\n\nI am looking for Pre WW2 cards from well-known Hall of Famers.  I would like to do a single higher-end card for a trade for the Comiskey and would be interested in adding the Timohty Keefe graded a 4 too if interested (see my other fs/ft ad in this forum).  I love T206, Goudey, T227, N300, N28, N29, Ramly, Mayo Plug, Cracker Jack, Old Judge, and Goodwin, etc.\n\nTake care and thank you for all of the inquiries!",
