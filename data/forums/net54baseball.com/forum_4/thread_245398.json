Peter F. Lynnet, who. with Mr. and Mrs. David Holden, were injured in an automobile accident near Goldsboro. Pa., last night. The Holdens were only slightly injured. Jennings is suffering from concussion of the brain, a fractured left arm and many gashes and bruises about the head and body.\"\n\nVery tough card to find as the population is listed as just this one card in the SGC pop reports (although I do know of one other which exists).",
