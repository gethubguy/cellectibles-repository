      "post_content": "Hi-\n\nBelow are scans of two 1878 Forbes trade cards for sale.  These were glued in an album back in the day and each has a glue type of stain on the back.  A Fly has a hole at the top (in the letter A) but both are otherwise nice with no creases.  I want 80.00 delivered for both cards.  Please let me know if you want them, need better scans, or if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nAlan\n[url]aelefson@hotmail.com[/url]",
