Not only did I not have a pre-war namesake, but had to settle for, in post-war era, 'Ray Culp' to have anything close.\n\nI'm glad Leon has a Bannon for you...congrats!\n\n-Raymond",

So are you interested in the one I showed or something else? I won't hold my breath.\n Hint- when you post a want on this BST you might come back and check in less than a week. We are old but not that old. :)",
