At this point they're only twice as old as me. I'm healthy but the prospect of facing the next \"milestone\" is uncomfortable. Please help to put me out these two sets to rest before people do so to me!! At least getting the TWO CARDS I need to finish my first set would make a statement. happy.gif I'm most likely to overpay for the last card I need in a set. \n\n missing first set: \n\n Edwards\n Wood\n\n upgrade first set:\n\n Ryan\n Ewing\n McGee\n Pettitt\n\n \n\n missing second set (lower grade - minor wear & bd ok): \n\n temple \n queckenberner \n lablanche \n cummings",
