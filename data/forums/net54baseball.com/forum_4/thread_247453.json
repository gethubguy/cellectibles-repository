      "post_content": "I have two Duryea cards that have a small variation in the team name. One is \"Cincinnati\" the other is \"Cincinnatis\" with an \"s\". I have included the photo of the variation with the \"s\" ontop of the page from the Photographic Baseball Cards of Goodwin & Co. reference book that I consider the ultimate guide of what is out there. In the book they do not have the variation where \"Cincinnati\" is used and his name and the team name are cut out of the photo.\n\nI assume the authenticated card is real. Is this a new variation that is just over looked?\n\n[IMG]https://preview.ibb.co/eMwcJG/IMG_20171112_085253.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://image.ibb.co/eS5Xkw/Duryea_Authenticated.jpg[/IMG]",
