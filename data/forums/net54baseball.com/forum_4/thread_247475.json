      "post_content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have a few cards in my collection for sale. The one 19th c card is an N172 Old Judge card of Chicken Wolf. The pose is of Wolf sliding into a base. This card was traded to me about seven years ago. I would like to sell it, or will do partial trade for 1911 Obaks.\n\nThe card is rebacked with the bottom OLD JUDGE Cigarettes portion clipped off. The photo looks great, very nice contrast and a clear image.\n\nI'm not sure of the value. This pose does not come up for sale very often.\n\nAsking $425\n\nTrying to get photos to work. Please let me know if you need scans.\n[URL=http://imgbox.com/ksBg7KCM][IMG]https://images2.imgbox.com/c4/f0/ksBg7KCM_o.jpg[/IMG][/URL] [URL=http://imgbox.com/Ts0qurBP][IMG]https://images2.imgbox.com/83/3c/Ts0qurBP_o.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nPlease email me at my work email at [url]pgbaldes@gannett.com[/url] with any questions or offers.\n\nThank you!\nPeter Baldes",
