      "post_content": "Shot in the dark here, but I am looking to acquire any c1894 Perkins Studio Cabinets to go along with my Jennings and Gleason.  I saw that there was a Perkins Studio Cabinet that was lumped into lot #142 of the most recent REA Auction, but there wasn't an image shown.  Perhaps a board member happened to pick that one up??\n\nAnyway, if you have any, I'd really love to see them and/or acquire them.\n\nYou will note that the images are VERY similar to the 1894 Betz Studio Cabinet w/ the Baltimore Orioles as well as the images on the 1894 Alpha Photo Engraving set.  I wonder if there was a connection there between the two studios (although Gleason looks significantly different between the two).\n\nPlease PM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] with any information.\n\nThanks,\nDerek",
