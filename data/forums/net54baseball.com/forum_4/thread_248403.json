      "post_content": "SOLD\n\nA very nice recently graded N172 Old Judge of Mike Dorgan in what apparently is an uncommon pose (no other PSA graded, but other poses have up to 14 graded).  Out of all Dorgan N172s, only one has been graded higher by PSA.  $900 delivered and insured.  Payment by PayPal F&F.\n\nPM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask any questions.  Thanks!\nKris",
