      "post_content": "From what I can find, these are two of the tougher ones from the set.\nThese are from 1913.  Evers was only manager in 1913 and in the other card, Mtichell was only on the Cubs for 1913 before being waived  on 7/29/13.\n\nCondition is good.  On Five Cubs - a light crease on Shulte's (sic) pants.  Evers has crease upper left corner and lower right.\n\nPrice is firm.  If interested please email me at   [url]peterfish56@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks.  peter",
