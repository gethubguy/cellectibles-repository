Its all good, was worried we weren't going to see winter this year :)\n\nMike, good to hear from you . . . Lady & Pretzel were at the heart of the team's success.  Their Old Judge cards, N172 and N173 alike, are near impossible w/ Detroit.\n\nJay, I've seen two Detroit copies and both are colored mounts (batting pose).  His cabinet with Pittsburgh (1889) appears to be a bit more common (I know of three copies) and of course regular mount (fielding pose).",
