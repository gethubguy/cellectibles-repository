      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nBrockelman had an intriguing group of the 1908 Dietsches in the auction that ended last night, and I wound up picking up 10 of them, so now I have to try to acquire as many as I can.  \n\nAnybody have any 1908 or 1909s available (other than Cobb)?  I'm especially interested in the players that don't appear in 1907, but will consider any.  (I don't need any of the 1907s themselves.)\n\nAlso always looking for my wants in these postcard sets:\nWolverine\nHM Taylor\nDetroit Free Press\nDietsche Cubs\nCleveland Souvenir Shop\nMax Stein\nMorgan Red Belt\netc.\n\nThanks-\n\nTim",

Glad to know they have a good home.  My Dad started collecting them and I added to them as he got too old to collect any longer.  Got a large group from Steve Murray here in Arlington Hts so your cards have some good lineage!\nJeff",

The 1907 has 16, 1908 has 6 new players ( black names on front ) - Bush, McIntyre, Summers, Thomas, Willett and Winter. White names on front indicate they were in the 1907 issue also. Some come with no name on front with 1908 copyright. The 1909 series includes 6 new players, plus 1 Team card ( again in black name on front  except Team Card) : Beckendorf, Delahanty, Tom Jones, Moriarty, Stanage and Works. Again some come with 1908 copyright but released in 1909. The Detroit Team Card may also be part of this set, nobody knows for sure. It does have \"Tigers\" listed on the front in \"White letters\". So it may be a stand alone. I would think black letters would be consistent with the set.",

      "post_content": "Interesting that you say that some players are from one year but have a different copyright.  I presume that's because of their service time - i.e. Beckendorf didn't play w/Detroit until 1909 yet his card is C@1908.  I will be back in touch with a question or two when I get these in hand-\n\nBest,\nTim\n\n[quote name=\"insidethewrapper\" post=1745188]There are 29 different ( if you include the Team Card ) between 1907-1909.
