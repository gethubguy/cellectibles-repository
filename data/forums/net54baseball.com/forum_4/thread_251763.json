I figure I will toss it out here before sending it off to ebay.\n\nGraded SGC 30, which is the highest graded one by SGC (Population 2; I own them both).\n\nI love this card, but I recently picked up one I like better, and the home accounting office said no on keeping them both. :D\n\nI am looking for CARD NO LONGER AVAILABLE net to me. I will pay for shipping with tracking. PM over post, and I will take it trumps negotiations.\n\nI suppose if someone wanted my other one, I could be talked into it, and keep this one, but it would take some convincing (see the Sockalexis thread for pics of that one).\n\nAs usual, please note that I work during the week, so I can't ship until Saturday.\n\nThanks,\nSean\n\nThis message approved by the home accounting office. :(",
