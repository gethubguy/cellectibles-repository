      "post_content": "Excerpt from 3/21 Forbes story highlighting Whitney and Dog.\n\nThe Rich History of Dogs and Baseball Cards\n\n\u201cLike all dogs, they probably worshipped their human companion and didn\u2019t know or care whether he was an all-star or a bench warmer,\u201d wrote the late baseball card historian Bob Lemke  about the many pooch-owning baseball players. \u201cThe dogs waited at home each night for the big guy to come home, sensing whether he\u2019d gone 4-for-4 and would be up for a game of fetch.\u201d\n\nImages of dogs have been collectors\u2019 and investors\u2019 best friends since the beginning of baseball cards. And they fit any budget.\n\nLet\u2019s start out with one of the most popular baseball cards in history. In 1887 Old Judge cigarettes issued a tobacco card of a small dog named Midget putting his precious paw on the knee of iourneyman infielder Art Whitney.\n\n\nThis delightful card is believed to have been a commentary on Midget\u2019s loyalty to his master versus Whitney\u2019s to his teams. During the course of his career, from 1880 to 1891, Whitney bounced between ten clubs in six cities, though he may have simply been released due to his good-field, no-hit reputation.\n\n\nThe original owner of this Midget and Whitney, now for sale, was so proud that he wrote the date on the back when he acquired it. They sure don't write like that anymore.\n\nWhatever the case, Midget and his master are pure cardboard gold. In 2016, an extremely rare oversized cabinet card version sold for a tail-wagging $18,000 in an Robert Edward auction. Last, September, a standard, smaller copy sold in a Mile High auction for $1,372, almost five times its historic average in an \u201cAuthentic\u201d grade.\n\nWhitney and Midget bring prices that dwarf all but the biggest stars among the Hall of Famers in the set.  Although there are probably fewer than 100 copies in existence, as with other common poses from the set, you\u2019re not too late to jump into the market. Heritage has one of the best copies, in excellent condition, up for auction starting March 28th. The pre-sale estimate is more than $4,000.\n\nA more affordable alternative, about $1200 in good condition, is in a Love of the Game auction ending on March 24. The first owner of this very handsome example was so happy that he wrote the date of his acquisition\u201412/21/87\u2014 on the back. \u201cSpeculating about what the writing might be, and from where it may have originated, only adds to its appeal!\u201d declares the auction house.",
