      "post_content": "Extremely clear real photo postcard depicting the 1908 Wausau Lumberjacks of the minor league \u201cD\u201d level Wisconsin-Illinois league.  Excellent condition with no visible faults.  Back is written on, stamped, and postmarked.  The PC measures exactly 3 1/4\u201d x 5 1/4\u201d, 1/4\u201d smaller than \u201cstandard\u201d postcards, but I see no signs of trimming and believe it was made this way.  Lower right corner states \u201cCOPYRIGHT APPD FOR MAY 1908 BY J.M. COLBY, WAUSAU. WIS.\u201d\n\nThe 1908 team featured the following Major Leaguers:\n\nWard Miller - Outfielder, seated lower left (the nose is unmistakable).  Miller had a productive 8 years in the big leagues, jumping from Class D Wausau all the way to the Pittsburgh Pirates the next year in 1909, also spending time with Cincinnati that season.  With Cincinnati again in 1910, the Chicago Cubs in \u201812 and \u201813, then jumped to St.Louis in the Federal League for the 1914 and 1915 seasons.  Finished his big league career playing for the St. Louis Browns in 1916 - 1917.  Career .278 hitter in over 2,200 at bats.  If his name sounds familiar, he is one of the key, tough cards to obtain in the T207 set.  Also appeared in the 1914 and 1915 Cracker Jack sets, among others.\n\nFrank Lange - Pitched for the 1910 - 1913 Chicago White Sox, winning 28 games while compiling a 2.96 era.  Appears in the T205 and T207 sets, as well as Colgan\u2019s Chips.\n\nCharlie Ferguson - Pitched in only one game for the 1901 Chicago Cubs, going 2 innings without giving up a run.  That was it for his big league career.\n\nSOLD delivered, payment by PayPal F/F preferred.\n\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url]",

I believe Lange is either in the top row, standing second from R to L, or in the bottom row, sitting on the far right.  I don\u2019t have any idea on Ferguson.\n\nPerhaps others with better facial recognition skills than me can weigh in!\n\nThanks,\nKris",

There are a total of 16 who had stats for Wausau in 1908 and 12 players in uniform shown on the PC.  I do not know for certain that Lange and Ferguson are both shown.  However, 4 of the players on the roster played less than 40 games.  Ferguson was the manager/player, so it\u2019s possible he could be one of the gentlemen in a suit as well.\n\nTeam Roster \n\nNameAgeBTHtWtDoBBirthplaceStintFromTo\nH.
