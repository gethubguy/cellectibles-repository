      "post_content": "Hi guys selling a few PC796 1910 Sepia postcards. Included here are Tris Speaker and George Gibson. Both are extremely rare, SGC shows only 5 Speakers have been graded and 6 Gibsons. Beautiful images here. I'm thinking both would grade between a 2 and a 3, as I submitted 4 others from a large collection I purchased and they all graded in that a range. Asking $1900 delivered on the Speaker and $650 delivered on the Gibson. Message me with any questions.",
