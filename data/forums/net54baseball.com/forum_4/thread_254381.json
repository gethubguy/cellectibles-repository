      "post_content": "Really neat postcard showing the Oxford Confectionary Caramel Factory in Oxford, Pennsylvania. In 1921, the year this postcard was used, the Oxford Confectionery company (formerly Breisch-Williams) used baseball cards - the E253 Oxford Confectionary set - as promotional items that they included with its candy.  \n\nAsking $105 delivered.  This is a must-have for anyone who has an interest in the e107/e103/e253 sets and would like a companion piece to go along with the cards.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=314088&d=1525045681[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=314089&d=1525045692[/IMG]",
