      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\nAvailable for sale is a sweet 1908 Pirates Vignette Postcard of Howie Camnitz. These are quite tough to find and this one is real nice. Faint smudges on the front and soft corners don't detract from the quality of the image. Postcard has been postally used with a stamp and writing on the reverse. Price is SOLD including shipping, tracking & insurance from Canada. PM or post if interested and thanks for looking.\nJeff",
