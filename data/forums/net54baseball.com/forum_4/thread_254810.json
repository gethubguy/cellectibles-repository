      "post_content": "SOLD - THANK YOU! Real photo postcard of the 1912 Pittsburgh Pirates at Hot Springs, Arkansas with those shown including Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, Barney Dreyfuss, Max Carey, and Bill McKechnie. Unused with a touch of light wear to corners, one minor wrinkle (on right side and only visible upon close inspection of the front, not evident when viewing from the back), and a few very minor spots of discoloration. Very rare with this being only the second copy I have seen aside from one which sold in a Goodwin auction (December 2010, $616 w/premium). ------------ (or make me an offer) and I will ship priority at my expense. Payment accepted through Paypal F/F. Have had several transactions on the board at similar dollar levels and would always look to complete all deals to the satisfaction of the buyer. Please PM or post with questions or to purchase.",
