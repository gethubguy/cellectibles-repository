(NY looks like brittle-break from storage)\n\n[IMG]https://thecard.store/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-29-at-3.27.08-PM.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://thecard.store/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-29-at-3.26.36-PM.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://thecard.store/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-29-at-3.26.27-PM.png[/IMG]",
