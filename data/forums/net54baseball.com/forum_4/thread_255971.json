Of most interest is the box score of the St George v Boston match which featured Harry and George Wright as well as Creighton (Jim Creighton?). If it was Jim Creighton, this was just a few months before his untimely death. $500 or best bid. Please respond to [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]. First payment received gets this item.",
