The one with writing has a neat note making fun of how poorly he addressed it and talking about attending games - he even put a green X on his seat on the front. The unused example has an erasure along the top of the back.\n\nUnused: SOLD\n\nUsed: [STRIKE]$85[/STRIKE] $70\n\nRebacked Babe Ruth postcard - the back is a real RPPC but the front is modern. Novelty piece. $15 (SOLD)\n\nHershey PA postcard that is shaped like a candy bar: $15 (SOLD)",
