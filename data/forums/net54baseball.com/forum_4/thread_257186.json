That is the 1887 Tomlinson team picture, most commonly found in imperial format 16x20 or regular cabinet size (4 1/4 x 6 1/2).  Kalamazoo Bats would be the exception as a non-Tomlinson mount.  I've never seen an authentic 1887 team picture in CDV size.  I suspect this might be a close relative to a fake that surfaced in 2013 at the door step of REA.  Brian Dwyer was suspicious and quickly confirmed it was a modern creation.  Similar to your copy, the fake was found on a non-Tomlinson mount.  Does this look like an authentic albumen print to you?  I hope I'm wrong, it would be real neat to see a CDV of the 1887 team (as strange as that would be).",

It is clearly albumen.  \n\nI too found it odd that it\u2019s not on a cabinet card and was perplexed when I couldn\u2019t find a suitable comp for pricing purposes but as I was researching it I read that it was common in that era to \u201cpirate\u201d other photographers\u2019 images and use it was a kind of trade card for advertising purposes.  Copyright laws didn\u2019t really offer much protection (Mathew Brady is an example).  This particular photographer was probably working on a smaller scale and reused old mounts for that purpose, or ordered cheaper smaller mounts.  I suppose it\u2019s possible also that they licensed the image for a short time.  This would make sense since CDV\u2019s were still around even in the late 1880\u2019s and collected in albums.  Even more so if there was 1887 \u201cChampionship Mania\u201d in Detroit.  \n\nI\u2019m sure this diminishes the value somewhat (or maybe a lot),, but it is still a neat period curiosity. .",

He said that pirated versions usually have blank mounts but not always.  It could have either been authorized by Millard himself or perhaps the creation of a rogue employee.  I asked him how he would price such an item and he said he's not sure about this particular subject, but that it should be worth significantly less than an original, but it depends on various factors...\n\nDefinitely a huge bummer. :(:(",
