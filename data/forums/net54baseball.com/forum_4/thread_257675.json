      "post_content": "Very fun group from the more obscure H891 Tobin\u2019s Lithographs Color Set including HOFer King Kelly.  All cards had the top right portion cut away which was either blank or contained advertising, hence the SGC A designation.\n\nAsking $SOLD delivered for the group but will of course listen to offers. Just shoot me a PM. Can also provide more detailed scans on request.\n\nReally neat cards.....\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1101&pictureid=24962[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=1101&pictureid=24963[/IMG]",
