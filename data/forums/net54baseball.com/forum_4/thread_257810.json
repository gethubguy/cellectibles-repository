      "post_content": "One of the toughest Dietsche cards, shows Ty Cobb sitting next to Rastus.\n\nRastus was the team good luck charm that Cobb treated so much better than his fellow teammates.  More about their relationship can be found in the outstanding book 'A Terrible Beauty' which pretty much debunks all the crazy (and false) stories that portray Cobb as a racist.  An important card.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/playerphotos/large/1909%20Dietsche%20Tigers%20SGC%2030.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/playerphotos/Cobb%20and%20Ratus.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSOLD",
