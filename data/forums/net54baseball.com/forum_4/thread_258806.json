Please note: The right border has a bowed cut that narrows toward the top right corner and the tone between his head and throwing arm is lighter than the tone on the rest of the card-$100.00 (sold)\n\nThe card was previously in a SGC 30 Good 2 case. The previous owner preferred keeping his cards in binders and top loaders. A scan of the card in the SGC holder is attached.\n\nS/h is an additional $6.95 (certified mail).
