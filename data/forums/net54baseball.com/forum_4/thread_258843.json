The glue wouldn't make it AUT, unless it had something to do with hiding some flaw, I believe. The corners have no fraying and are somewhat worn. That is probably a trimming issue. That said this card in question presents better than many which are several grades higher.",

It had pinholes which had a tiny bit of blue color within and around the holes. I called and they told me this was the only reason that it received an A. It was not trimmed or anything else. Now tell me, who would try to cover up a pinhole with blue paint? To me it's very likely this was pinned up on a wall with blue paint. So why the A??\n\n:confused:\n\n[quote name=\"Leon\" post=1809353]Great looking card. The glue wouldn't make it AUT, unless it had something to do with hiding some flaw, I believe.
