      "post_content": "Outstanding REAL PHOTO postcard of the 1906 Lancaster Red Roses team.  I've seen the printed version using the same image (example:  [url]http://loveofthegameauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=5937[/url]\nbut have not seen an RPPC. \n\nGreat image clarity. Undivided clean back.  Corner wear but no creases.\n\nSOLD delivered, PayPal F/F please.  PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url]\n\nPlease see the item description in the linked LOTG auction for possible Major League players shown.  I have been able to likely identify the following:\n\nCy Barger - Back row, middle.  Unmistakable (see T205 card).  Cards include T206, T205, T202 and Cracker Jack.\n\nPatsy Dougherty - Back row, second from right to left.  Cards include T206, T205, Rose PC.\n\nEd Lennox - Second row, right in the middle.  Cards include T206, T205, T202, and T3.\n\nDave Altizer - Bottom row, far right.\n\nTom Downey is likely pictured as well (T206, T205, T3) as he played 122 games for Lancaster in 1906, but I cannot pick him out.\n\nPlease let me know if you can identify anyone else!",
