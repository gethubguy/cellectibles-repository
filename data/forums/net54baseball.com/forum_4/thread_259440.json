      "post_content": "This card came out of the Goldin Auction scrapbook find of several years ago. Apparently what happened was that the photo sheet tore during production but was still used. Although the photo was torn, the cardboard backing is undamaged. The card is guaranteed genuine. Gypsy Queens of HOFers are extremely scarce and, despite the obvious obverse damage, the clarity is superior. $5000 or equivalent value trade. If interested, please email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks--Jay",
