I\u2019d like to trade these for t206 or caramel cards....but am kinda clueless on value.\n\nIf anyone has any info to share on these....please PM me.\n\nMake an offer?!?!  And my apologies if the Japanese postcard inscription offends anyone. Definitely a different time.\n\n[IMG]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1847/44647612541_00fff3cb17_b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1858/44647614661_b2e1ffdc71_b.jpg[/IMG]",
