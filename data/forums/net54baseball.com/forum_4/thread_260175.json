No creases, though it has one light wrinkle in the top center (you can see it in the photo) and the photo surface does have some light cracks in it, but nothing chipping off. The back is super clean.\n\nAsking $300 or BO.\n\n[IMG]https://d28lcup14p4e72.cloudfront.net/1237/4081909/2018-09-21%2008.00.45.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://d28lcup14p4e72.cloudfront.net/1237/4081910/2018-09-21%2008.00.59.jpg[/IMG]",
