      "post_content": "1. Boyce-Washington. Nice copy of scarce card--GONE\n2. Banning-Washington. Very difficult card to find--GONE\n3. Conway-Worcester. Rare team variation--GONE\n4. Alcott-Mansfield. Rare Ohio team only known on Alcott--GONE\n5. Hart-Des Moines. Difficult card in nice shape--GONE\n6. Joe Miller-Minneapolis. Rarity on most want lists--$2500\n7. Bassett-New York. Rare 1890 card which documents Bassett's move after the 1889 season from Indianapolis to New York. Team change 1890 cards are rarer and more valuable than 1890 NL cards where the player just remained with his 1889 team.--GONE\n8. Denny-New York. Like Bassett, after the 1889 season Denny moved from Indy to New York. Rare 1890 card which is rebacked--GONE\n9. \"Jim\" Keefe-New York. Extremely rare 1888 Tim Keefe spelling error where the HOFer is called Jim. Only a handful of these known-$1250\n\nPlease email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url] if interested. Please notify me if you want additional scans.\n\nThanks--Jay",
