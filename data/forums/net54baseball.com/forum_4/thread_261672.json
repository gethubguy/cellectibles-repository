      "post_content": "Neat group of 29 handcut cards that were cut from the pages of Allen & Ginter premium albums. They feature the same lithography, but are printed on a slightly thinner stock of paper and are all blank-backed. All are original to the period and were issued at the same time the actual cards were released.  Highlights from this group include HOFer John Ward as well as a complete set of cut-outs from the n29 boxing cards.  All are in terrific shape as well.\n\nComplete list of players is below.  \n\nNeat group of handcut cards that are tough to find individually, much less a larger group of them.  Larger scans available upon request. Asking $195 delivered for the group.
