      "post_content": "Hi - I'm selling the pictured N172 OJ of Brooklyn Bridegrooms manager Bill McGunnigle.  The card has been graded an SGC 10, though the front presents much, much better, with a strong image and no real flaws.  \n\nThe SGC 10 grade has been assigned for some light paper loss on the back, as I don't really see anything else going on with the card (maybe a light wrinkle visible on the back?)  \n\nSend me a PM with your email, and I can send you a better hi-res pic of the card if you would like.\n\nPrice is SOLD delivered - PayPal or check fine by me.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
