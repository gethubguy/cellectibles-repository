      "post_content": "Over the weekend, from the Goldin Auction I picked up a \"Richter's History of Records of Baseball\" inscribed in 1914 by Francis Richter to Roy A. Thomas, who was more than a journeyman (in my opinion) center fielder for the Phillies from 1898 through 1911 (with a end of year stint for the Pirates in 1908 and a year with the Boston Doves in 1909), who then coached with Penn, where he had played collegiate ball. The lot included a photo of him in his Penn uniform. I am searching to see if there is a base ball of any type for him. Anyone have one.  Also all suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!!",
