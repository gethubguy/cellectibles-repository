      "post_content": "Oversized 4 x 6.25 Fred Wagner RPPC featuring the Chicago White Sox.  The regular postcard versions of this image are common, the oversized RPPC version is extremely rare, just try and find another one.\n\nIt shows HOFers Walsh (middle row far left), Davis (top row third from left) and Comiskey (top row in suit).  Postmarked just prior to the 1906 World Series.\n\nPosted are scans of the front and back, a photo of the front (true sepia tone is hard to capture) and a regular postcard (not included) which IDs the players.\n\n$750 shipped obo\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=337462&d=1544891668[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=337463&d=1544891684[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=337464&d=1544891691[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=337465&d=1544891698[/IMG]",
