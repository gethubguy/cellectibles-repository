      "post_content": "Asking SOLD , PayPal f/f, dlvd... if PayPal goods pls add 3%. \n\nThis is a very rare Ty Cobb postcard from 1925, with a current population graded of 4. There were a total of eight subjects in the set and all of them were also managers except for Babe Ruth. \n\nThe grade of SGC 2 is due to light pencil marking on the back, but otherwise it\u2019s really in great condition. My shadow is appearing a bit in the photo of the back and that is not a discoloration on the card.",
