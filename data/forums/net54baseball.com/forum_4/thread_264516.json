      "post_content": "Now why would anyone have any interest in this 1886 minor league, albeit rare, program? For starters, Frank Selee began his managing career by managing Haverhill. This was his second year at the helm. In 1887, Selee would head west to Oshkosh where he assembled one of the greatest minor league teams ever. These were the beginnings of a HOF career. Also, the Brocktons featured Tommy McCarthy. He had started the season with Haverhill, moved on to Providence, and after they folded moved to Brockton. He would end the season as the top batter in the New England League. Finally, these two rosters featured many players who would later star in the pro ranks and be featured in the Old Judge set. Among them were: Bill McGunnigle as a player, Bill Hawes, Jumbo Davis, Owen Patton, Jim Cudworth, Chippy McGarr, John Irwin, Mike Slattery, Con Murphy and Jimmy Cooney. Fully scored and extremely rare\u2014 $1250, or best bid. Please contact me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url] if interested.\n\nThanks\u2014Jay",
