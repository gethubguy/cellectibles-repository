Moonlight Graham played for Scranton during the time that this set was issued in the Scranton team was one of the teams that was issued.  I believe this is the only downer individual card and a milligram. There are a few other team postcards of Moonlight Graham while he play for Scranton. As far as I know there are only two examples of these that exist although I\u2019m sure there may be others in other advanced collections.
