      "post_content": "Gus Weyhing - Popular 19th century semi-star Philadelphia Athletic pitcher with 264 wins and 277 hit batsmen (MLB record). Somewhat rugged condition with slightly-rounded corners, angular right-edge cut, slight separation of picture layer from backer along the long edges, small 45-degree crease in the lower-left corner, and missing cardboard backer layer corresponding to the wrinkle area on the front. The image, however, is dark and crisp with great contrast.  [STRIKE]Asking $250.[/STRIKE] \n\nSam Trott - Decent 8-year utility player pictured here with the popular Baltimore Oriole team. Somewhat rugged condition with slightly-rounded corners, minor jagged wrinkle in the upper-right corner, and a major jagged crease running side-to-side about two-thirds down from the top. The image, however, is gorgeous. Dark and crisp with great contrast. [STRIKE]Asking $175[/STRIKE] \n\nBilly O'Brien - An absolutely gorgeous card of the 5-year corner infielder pictured here with the Washington Nationals. Beautiful corners, edges, back, and centering. Crisp, clear photo with wonderful contrast. [STRIKE]Asking $250.[/STRIKE]\n\nBack scans available upon request.\n\nEmails to [url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url]\nPaypal Friends/Family payments",
