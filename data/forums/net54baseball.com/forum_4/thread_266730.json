      "post_content": "One of the most interesting subsets of the massive Old Judge set is player portraits. Numerous collectors have found this a manageable way to collect Old Judges. Amongst the portraits some are relatively easy, while other are quite difficult. A few are genuinely rare. One falling into this latter category are the portraits of Jim McCormick. McCormick was the star of the Chicago staff and is a borderline HOF possibility. Offered herein is the McCormick in street clothes with hat portrait. Price is $7500 obo. If interested please email me at [url]oldjudge@gmail.com[/url]\n\nThanks--Jay",
