      "post_content": "Babe Ruth related piece - St. Mary's Industrial School Band Postcard circa 1910/1920\n\nYou most likely know the store of a young Babe Ruth and how he was sent to live at St Mary's School, well did you know he was in the band there?\n\n\"Ruth said he played in the band at St. Mary's and always pointed with pride to this accomplishment, frequently reminding friends that he also was a musician as well as a ball player. Curiously enough, however, no one ever discovered what instrument the Babe played, although he always stoutly denied that it was the bass drum.\"\n\nNot much Ruth pre-baseball career memorabilia out there - great conversation piece.\n\nIs a young Ruth in this picture? Possibly.  Where's Waldo?\n\nCompare against this other one currently up on Ebay at $275:\n\n[url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/1920-21-Babe-Ruth-Band-St-Marys-Industrial-Boys-School-RARE-RPPC-AD-Postcard/303076016605?hash=item4690bd01dd:g:oeQAAOSw5E9azTq4:rk:5:pf:0[/url]\n\n\n$35 Shipped  Paypal Friends and Family preferred - check or M/O good too",
