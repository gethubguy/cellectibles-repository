      "post_content": "Selling a partial set of 1907 Wolverine postcards (12/20 cards) plus a Dietsche and H.M. Taylor postcard. The Wolverines include 2 hall of famers - Crawford and Jennings. The Crawford is crease free with some minor chipping along the border. The Jennings has a crease through the entire card. Also includes \u201cWild Bill\u201d at the water wagon, Schaefer and O\u2019Leary work double play, Couhglin, Schmidt, Killian, Mullin, Downs, Rossman, Davy Jones, and Schaefer. The Dietsche Downs and H.M. Taylor Couhglin batting are in rough shape with multiple creases and wear. It\u2019s difficult to grade postcards but I would say most of the Wolverines are in the Vgex range with no creasing (besides the Jennings) and all have clean backs/never mailed. The Cobb batting from this collection came back a PSA 3. Asking $1500 delivered OBO. Thanks",
