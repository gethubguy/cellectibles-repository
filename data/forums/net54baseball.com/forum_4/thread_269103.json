And pretty sure it\u2019s against the forum rules. Not cool. Seeing more and more of this all the time. \n\nGreat card. Good luck with the sale.",

Obviously I may be alone in that thinking on this board, but that's how it goes in life sometimes. I bet you will sell it, though-- it is a rare card! GLWS!",

I am sorry if I don\u2019t understand capital markets as well. \n\nBut I will say that we are likely operating in different leagues so you may want to keep your comments to yourself. \n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

There isn't anything illegitimate that I can see. Members can ask any price they want to for something. It is not anyone else's business what price is asked with respect to any profit or cost or anything else. If you don't like someone's price then don't buy it. But don't comment about it unless it is a PM and then it shouldn't be in a harassing fashion. Please consider this your final warning. Thanks man.",
