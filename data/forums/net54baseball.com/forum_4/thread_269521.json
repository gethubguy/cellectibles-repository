      "post_content": "Fantastic item!! Correctly graded technically as an SGC 45, but the post card presents as a strong NM with razor sharp corners....The blemish is a couple of very faint \"dirty\" finger prints at the bottom of the card. It is unmarked with no post marks or writing, clean back. This card features futures super players such as Bull Durham, Patsy Dougherty, and Chief Meyers (personal catcher for Christy Mathewson). Please send me your email for detailed pics....Thanks $850 delivered...PRICED Now at $675....Thanks",
