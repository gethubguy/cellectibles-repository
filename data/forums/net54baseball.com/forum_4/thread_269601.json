      "post_content": "These were sold recently on the BST here and I took them in trade from a friend.  Wish I could keep everything, but these don't quite fit into my collection.\n\nThey look a lot better in person.  I couldn't figure out how to get a good picture of them (they look washed out because of the light in the room, then I tried with flash and got spots of glare, etc) so I scanned them.  For some reason Gilbert's scan has some blue on it.  That is just on the scan, not the actual item.\n\nPrices include shipping and assume a no-fee payment method.  Thanks for looking!\n\nArt Devlin $525\n\nBilly Gilbert $425\n\nBilly Lauder $425",
