      "post_content": "Hi guys selling a 1907 Wolverine Crawford. Card has some wear along the edges but is crease free. There is also some staining, seen mainly on the right edge of the front and is more obvious on the reverse. Still an extremely rare card from this set. I can send clearer pics if desired, I was having issues uploading images. Asking $Sold Thanks!",
