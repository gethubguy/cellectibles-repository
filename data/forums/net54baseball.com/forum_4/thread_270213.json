      "post_content": "Wow, I love that Bregstone card of Eddie Higgins, who pitched with the Cardinals for parts of the 1909-10 seasons.\n\nLook closely and you'll see that this card was written by pitcher Grover Lowdermilk to his wife, back home in Odin, IL.  It was written on June 28, 1909, describing his negotiations with the Cardinals for a contract.  Evidently, they did work things out, because Grover signed and made his Major League debut five days later, on July 3.\n\nAs for Eddie Higgins, he had made his ML debut on May 14, then pitched in six more games between then and June 14.  He was then gone, pitching for Little Rock, by the time Grover wrote this card.  Maybe no one knew if he would return, and the club was passing out Eddie's cards to be used for letter writing - who knows.  Higgins wasn't a star, and had been gone from the team for two weeks.  Or, perhaps Higgins and Lowdermilk had known each other back in Illinois, although Grover grew up in southern Illinois and Eddie near Chicago.\n\nLowdermilk remained with the Cardinals for the rest of the 1909 season, and Higgins returned and spent September/Oct with the team, so they WERE together with the Cardinals for about a month.",
