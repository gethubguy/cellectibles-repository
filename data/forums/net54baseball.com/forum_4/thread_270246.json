Each one advertises a store run by A R Fisher and the cards state they sell rubber balls, base balls, and bats.  I believe these are from Rhode Island as the back has several Newport RI trade cards.  Please let me know if you need better pictures, are interested, or have any questions.  The price is 100.00 delivered.\n\nAlan",
