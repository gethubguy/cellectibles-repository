      "post_content": "Up for sale is the following 1899 M101-1 Sporting News Supplement of Nap Lajoie.  \n\nMost would classify this as Lajoie's \"rookie\" issue.  The supplement has been graded as BGS 1.5 (Fair) by the strict graders at Beckett.  I'd be happy to send better pictures of the front and back if desired, but don't be surprised if this sells before I get the chance.  A BVG Auth example sold for $2,700 in a recent Love of the Game Auction offering:\n\n[url]https://loveofthegameauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=16291[/url]\n\nI'm asking only TRADED for this example.\n\nFirst to email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] with an \"I'll take it!\" will be the proud new owner.  Paypal f/f preferred.\n\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/hofrookies1/websize/1899%20Lajoie.jpg[/IMG]",

Two light folds/creases to the left and right of Nap's face are what kept the technical grade down.  They are very hard to see unless up close or in just the \"right\" light.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/6DCC360C-53DD-44FE-8002-C977317138F81.jpeg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/5DF8FC1E-D073-4931-999B-D41B601911821.jpeg[/IMG]",
