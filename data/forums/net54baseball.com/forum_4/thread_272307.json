      "post_content": "Looking for the cards listed below to finish off my N29 set.  I prefer PSA slabbed cards for the sake of consistency with the others I've already tracked down which are all PSA.  My current N29's are generally in the PSA 3 - 5 range with some outliers, however, I know there are some wildly different condition issues with these cards so depending on the severity I may/may not be interested.\n\nI know it's a long shot but hopefully someone out there happens to have something.  Let me what you've got and how much you're looking for and let's see if we can make a deal!
