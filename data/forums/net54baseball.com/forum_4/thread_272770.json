      "post_content": "Graded PSA 2 (MK) by PSA, the only example that has ever been graded by PSA; I have seen just one graded by SGC.  Features both Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison (Large Heads).  Catalogued N154 and issued by Duke & Sons, the Presidential B.B. Club set is similar in dimensions (4.25 x 2.25 inches), design, and rarity to Kalamazoo Bats, but instead of ballplayers, they feature large photos of the presidential and vice presidential candidates of 1888. Each portrait is superimposed on baseball player bodies. On this card, Grover Cleveland is pictured with ball in hand as he puts the tag on a sliding Benjamin Harrison. The number \"154\" is written on the reverse in blue ink. The front of this card has an overall Excellent appearance. Very rare card and issue (70 cards total graded by PSA and SGC combined), the prices of which have been flying up as of late.  $1500 delivered. PM or email if interested. \n\n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/7908/47426936992_2d2cd3f11b_z.jpg[/img]",
