      "post_content": "Hi everyone I\u2019m contemplating selling my PSA 2 1907 Wolverine News Ty Cobb Batting Postcard. Combined population of PSA and SGC is 13. Card presents extremely well for the grade, it has edge wear and a very light crease extending from the left border in about an inch. This postcard has not been mailed and the reverse is clean. Asking $25k OBO. Everyone has seen the other rookie year postcards explode recently and this is rarer than the Dietsche fielding and the Wolverine Port. Message me with questions, offers, or better pic requests. Thanks!",
