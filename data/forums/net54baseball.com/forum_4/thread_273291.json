      "post_content": "Up for sale is this sweet looking 1906 Lancaster Red Roses Team Postcard featuring several future major leaguers as well as many who would later be part of the important T206 set (aka \"the monster\").  Included are Chief Meyers, Cy Barger, Chappelle, Dougherty, Downey, Lennox, and Bull Durham, among others.\n\nThis postcard was postally used in 1906.  Interestingly, the postcard writer mentions Barger as \"being o.k.\".  Haha!  I guess he was right.  Barger would make it to the majors later that season but wasn't particularly good for his career.  Chief Meyers, on the other hand, ended up better than \"o.k.\" \n\nAsking only [STRIKE]$XX[/STRIKE] $SOLD net for the postcard.  Paypal f/f preferred.  Shipping will be on me.  Please email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1906%20Lancaster%20Team%20PC.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1906%20Lancaster%20Team%20PC%20_back_.jpg[/IMG]",
