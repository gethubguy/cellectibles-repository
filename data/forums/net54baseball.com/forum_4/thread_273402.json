      "post_content": "Nice uncreased example of an 1894 Mayo's Cut Plug of Frank Butterworth.  Not sure what warranted the Authentic grade.  Wear around the edges but uncreased and a solid black back.  Butterworth was a two-time All American fullback and running back for Yale.  He later coached them to an undefeated National Championship.  $pending + $4 shipping.  Check or M.O.  \n\nRob M\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=365531&d=1568059770[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=365532&d=1568059777[/IMG]",
