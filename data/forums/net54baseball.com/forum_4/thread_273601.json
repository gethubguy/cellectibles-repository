This is NOT an exhibit card, as expressly stated on the back along with the normal postcard back features.  \n\nThere is a light crease in the lower left corner as shown in the images below.  The back shows some color toning/fading from residing in a postcard album, but no glue was used and there is no damage.\n\nSOLD delivered, net to me, with payment by PayPal Friend preferred.  \n\nPM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask any questions.\n\nThanks!",
