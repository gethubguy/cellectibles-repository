Refers to a 9/18/07 doubleheader vs the White Sox so we know these cards were created before then making it the earliest of the 1907 Cobb rookies.\n\nSender's note:\n\"I was over to the last game at Det. - with Chi. first before school opened and saw the first big game.  I love seeing a double header.  I got this card there after the games one of which Det. got and one Chi.\"\n\nSOLD\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/musc/large/item_58242_1_130270.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/bicem/musc/large/item_58242_2_130271.jpg[/IMG]",
