      "post_content": "FS: 1904 New York Giants Horner Team PC. Real photo team composite with photos by Carl Horner. There were two companies that issued this card, Rotograph, and US Souvenir. This is the US Souvenir version.\n\nApologies for the craptastic photos, and note the reflection of my phone in the first photo. My current scanner doesn't like slabs, so I pulled together the best I have for this PC. \n\n$600 shipped OBO. Paypal ok, ff preferred.\n\nMsg here or email to take it.\n\nRay\n\nsemloh00 (at) yahoo.com\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/r5vzppT/1904-NY-Giants-sm-sh.jpg[/img]\n <b>\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/gTMKbF9/IMG-2079.jpg[/img]\n<b>\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/G3LKPjw/1904-new-york-giants-team-composite-postcard.jpg[/img]",
