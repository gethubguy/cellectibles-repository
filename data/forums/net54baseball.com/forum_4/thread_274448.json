      "post_content": "Scarce Dietsche postcard showing the entire Tigers team, including Ty Cobb sitting next to their young African-American good luck charm, Lil' Rastus.  This team card was only issued in 1909, when Dietsche production numbers were very low, making this one of the toughest cards in the set to obtain.\n\nThis example has creases in each of the corners and the bottom center.  It appears the left edge has bee very slightly trimmed.  The postcard always has very thin borders, but the left edge is uneven, with the margin width varying.  \n\nSOLD delivered net to me, with payment by PayPal (Friends) preferred.\n\nPlease post here, PM, or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url]",
