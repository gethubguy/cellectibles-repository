      "post_content": "SOLD. This is the description from when I purchased from LOTG many years ago. \n\nCollector-grade example of one of the N172 issue's most iconic cards, depicting Hall of Fame catcher Buck Ewing along with the team's mascot Willie Breslin, standing on a chair.  Graded AUTHENTIC by PSA, card #149-11 emanates from an original owner collection, offered initially by Love of the Game in April of 2013 as consigned by the family of Ernest Born (who stamped his name on the card reverse as a youngster).  Despite the grade, we do not believe the card has been trimmed, although the image is notably tilted to the left.  The cuts, however, appear natural.  The card's greatest flaw, however, is its significant fading and surface wear.  Despite this, a very popular and typically very expensive card from the N172 issue.\n\n\n$485 shipped. Paypal f/f, Venmo or checks accepted. Thanks for looking. Dave",
