      "post_content": "Scarce 1955 Don Wingfield glossy, real-photo postcards, one signed by Chuck Stobbs and the other by Dean Stone, pitchers for the Washington Senators. I guarantee both the cards and autographs to be authentic, and I guarantee the autographs will pass a review by a reputable, recognized authenticator. $25 each or $40 for both, delivered.  SOLD\n\nStobbs is perhaps best remembered for a game in 1953, his first season with the Senators after several seasons with the Boston Red Sox, when \"Mickey Mantle slammed a home run off Stobbs that went completely out of Washington\u2019s Griffith Stadium on April 17 and estimated at 565 feet (this figure is often disputed). The storied blast was one of the longest home runs ever hit in major league baseball.\"\n\nNOTE: I am looking for a 1955 Don Wingfield PC of Pete Runnels, with or without his autograph - will pay strong or do a trade in you favor.",
