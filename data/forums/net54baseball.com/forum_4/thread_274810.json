      "post_content": "Up for sale is the following N172 Old Judge \"rookie\" card of HOFer Amos Rusie.  The card has been professionally graded VG/EX (4) by PSA.  The biggest flaw is that the card contrast is relatively light, although that is pretty typical for Rusie examples.\n\nThis card is purportedly one of the toughest HOFers (in terms of scarcity) within the Old Judge set - the third hardest HOFer according to the The Photographic Baseball Cards of Goodwin & Company book by Jay Miller, Joe Gonsowski, and Richard Masson.\n\nAsking [STRIKE]$X,XXX[/STRIKE] [STRIKE]$X,XXX[/STRIKE] $SOLD net to me, preferably via paypal.  I'll cover any shipping costs.  Please email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/hofrookies1/websize/1889%20Rusie.jpg[/IMG]",
