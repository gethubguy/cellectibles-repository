      "post_content": "1887 Old Judge Harry Stovey.  Embarrassed to admit to his family that he was playing baseball, he actually changed his name for his baseball career from Harry Stowe.  Harry ended up becoming the first ever baseball player to accumulate 100 home runs.  This card is graded an SGC 20, and has excellent eye appeal.\n\nSOLD SOLD SOLD net to me, after shipping/fees.  \n\n[img]http://mycollectionofcards.com/baseballcards/100319/20191018_075600_001.jpg [/img]\n\n[img]http://mycollectionofcards.com/baseballcards/100319/20191018_075613.jpg [/img]",
