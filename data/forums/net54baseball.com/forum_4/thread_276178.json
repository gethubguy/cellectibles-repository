      "post_content": "Earliest Cubs team postcard I'm aware of, this V.O. Hammon PC features the 1906 pennant winning team as well as HOFers Mordecai Brown, Tinker, Evers & Chance. Just one graded higher on the SGC pop chart, card is unused.  Rarely comes up for sale in this grade (just one time in the last ten years has this card graded as a 4 been sold in either PSA or SGC holders). $450 delivered.  Email or PM if interested, thanks. \n\n[img]https://live.staticflickr.com/6119/6312564272_feb754c0a2_c.jpg[/img]",
