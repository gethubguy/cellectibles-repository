      "post_content": "It took me a while to figure out at least a little bit about this postcard.  It is clearly a 20th century issued postcard, probably 1920's - 30s, but it depicts the 1889 Indianapolis Hoosiers team.  1889 was the third, and last, major league season for the club.\n\nMore about the issuer, Corbit Studio in Bristol, CT is found on the Vintageball.com website (upper right corner of the page) here:  [url]https://www.vintageball.com/PlayerPostcards2.html[/url]\n\nWhat I cannot answer is why they published this postcard.  I have never seen another 19th century team issued by Corbit.  The photo quality is excellent.\n\nSOLD, delivered, net to me with PayPal Friends preferred.  Please PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url]",
