      "post_content": "As best described by our friend and colleague at LOTG:\n\n\"This image depicts the entire 1912 Lawrence Barristers team in their first championship season of 1912.  Managed by Louis Pieper to a 76-47 record, the team featured four future major leaguers: Swede Carlstrom (back row, second from left), who played exactly two games with the 1911 Red Sox; Red Hoff (front row, second from left), who pitched 11 games for the Yankees and Browns between 1911 and 15 and lived to the ripe old age of 107, passing away in 1998; Ray Keating (back row, far left), who went 31-51 with a 3.29 ERA in a 7-year career with the Yankees and Braves; and Alex Pearson (middle row, third from right), a major league veteran at the time of this picture, with a 3-8 record and 3.85 ERA in 1902 and 03 with St. Louis and Cleveland.\"\n\nPrice: $SOLD, net to me, postpaid in the continental U.S.  Tax free.  :o\n\nPlease message me if interested.  Thank you.\n\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]",
