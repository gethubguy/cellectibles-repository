I have several framed and hanging on my wall.\n\nNot a great pix, but you can see the crease on the second page. You can probably notice some minor fading on these two pages if you compare side-by-side to other examples of these album pages.\n\nHappy to trade for N43 or other items on my wantlist.\n\nBest contact is ehpiiiATaolDOTcom. Thanks for looking!\n\nBest,\nEd",
