An equitable trade would be great, so if either party had to include some cards/funds, I'm fine with that.\n\nPlease message me if you should have another team available.  Thank you.  :)\n\n[url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[url]https://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/postcards/71441/dingman-rppc[/IMG]",
