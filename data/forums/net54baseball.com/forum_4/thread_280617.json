Jim\n\n1909 New Orleans Pelican Park Real Photo Postcard, any images of old Pelican Park are tough to find as the ballpark was only around from 1908-1914, this one of a kind image is the only postcard I'm aware of that features this old Southern League ballpark.  Note on the back dates the view to July 3, 1909, Little Rock Travelers vs New Orleans Pelicans. Edge/corner wear, vertical crease at center and crease bottom left corner.  $1200.00\n\n\nC1940 Joe DiMaggio Restaurant Advertising Postcard, unused, excellent condition.  $40.00\n\n1953 Real Photo Postcard view, interior of the Polo Grounds, photographed and produced by George Tinker, unused, excellent condition.  $40.00\n\nC1920 New York Giants Polo Grounds postcard, Helmar Cigarette sign, unused, no creases, very attractive condition, $80.00\n\n\nC1920 Boston Braves, exterior of Braves Field ticket office and entrance, there are a couple different croppings/colorings of this postcard image, this is the more difficult (and colorful) variation.  Unused, corner wear, no creases.  $75.00\n\n1913 White Sox vs Giants, World Tour, game played November 9, 1913 at the Pacific Coast League ballpark Washington Park, Los Angeles.  Real Photo Postcard, likely one of a kind.  No creases, writing on back.  $1000.00",
