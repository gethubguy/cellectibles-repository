      "post_content": "Obviously the ad has been trimmed from this cabinet but the image is just incredible. The scrapbook removal would indicate it was probably never exposed to light so the image is nice and dark.\nA little research on this player shows he\u2019s one of a rather small number of players who literally fell off the map after his playing career ended (mostly due to drinking problems). There is literally no info on him after he was released for the last time and he supposedly ended up homeless and on the streets, very sad but interesting story. Great display piece.\n$OLD\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200402/32e7de3930eacda570e77b598fbb67c4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200402/b9ed4f80a6257a1ce4b5b2b17454500f.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
