      "post_content": "I was wondering if one of you guys could help me out with pricing on these two guys. I used vcp, looked through eBay and the internet and I wasn't really able to find comps on these two in same holder. Plus the only sale I saw in Shaw fwas from many years ago. Same with Quinn. Both are in really nice shape with clean and unmarked backs.  I was happy with the grades from SGC. \nAny help would be appreciated.",
