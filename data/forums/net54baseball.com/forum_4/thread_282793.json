      "post_content": "Pretty low grade Mayo Brouthers . Looks to be touched up in spots at some point in the distant past as is so common on these...thus the low price. It will grade authentic but nothing more. Nice way to get a 19th century HOFer cheap.SOLD\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200507/65cc9206bed7afe17ec27320fe53d761.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200507/9178a2f9f94194ae5631eb1b53355fd0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
