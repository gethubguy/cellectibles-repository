      "post_content": "10 lots of Woodcuts + 3 doubles for $650.  Or, individually priced; see below.\n\nI'll also trade for T206's, which is mostly what I collect these days.\n\nThe 10 include woodcuts of a couple of dozen hall-of-famers, including Harry and George Wright, 1869 Red Stockings - the first professional championship team (includes the entire publication), Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Toronto teams, and many more.  All but one are from Harper's Weekly, 1869-1890's, and are in plastic sleeves, unattached on cardboards, as I received them.  Large as they are, they are difficult to package and expensive to ship, so I'd prefer to sell them as one group and have given a huge discount to do so.  \nBut if you'd like a particular team or player[s], individual prices are listed below.  Big discounts for multiple items.\n \nI bought these from Moushi in 2019-2020.  I am very grateful and indebted to him for his research and scans.\n[I am a dinosaur on the computer.  I was finally able to scan these on my phone, but I still can't upload them here; the system rejects them.]\n\nHere's Moushi's original thread, starting with his nine minute youtube presentation, which shows them all:\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lCiYMXy6O4[/url]\n\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=279344[/url]\n  \nPpff, Venmo, or pay by check.
