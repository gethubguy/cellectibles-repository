Eagerly seeking any DM or SC players or poses I'm missing.  Really hoping someone busts out Nyce from Burlington but happy to add any I need.  N172 or N173s.\n\nThanks Craig",

      "post_content": "Hello Craig,\n\nI picked up my copy nearly 10 years ago, shortly after I moved to Iowa.  At the time I thought about collecting all the Iowa players/poses but quickly realized it would be tough to find all the 1888 Des Moines cards so I've peeled that back to just a singular copy of each of the three teams.\n\nJay's copy of this card is very nice, good contrast.  My copy is a little bit lighter.  Pretty rare to see Burlington cards of Nyce surface but there are others out there.  Keep up the search, I like your chances of eventually being rewarded :)",
