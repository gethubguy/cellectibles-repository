It's a nice card with no creases, just a little corner wear and of course the writing/postmark on the reverse which I actually like. Price is $675 delivered. \n\nThe Cubs postcard is also in nice condition, just corner wear. Price is $450 delivered.\n\nJust about any form of payment is ok. If you have any questions let me know.\n[url]mhgt2833@gmail.com[/url]\nThanks\nMike\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/mhgt/wood/large/6C16A55B-8282-4011-AD7B-69FE99F7C940.jpeg[/IMG]\n1907-1909 H.M.
