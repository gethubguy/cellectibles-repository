I'm hoping to not have to spend too much per card as I'm just getting started.  \n\nWould love it if someone could part with a group of cards, so I'd say I'd be interested in individual cards or groups!  Any player is fine!\n\nStill got a few things to trade as well if anyone is interested in going that route --\n\ne107s - [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=272785[/url]\nm116 Proofs - [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=255222[/url]\nn284 Buchner Gold Coin Ad Pieces - [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=284644[/url]\nm116 short prints and rarities - [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=254859[/url]\nA couple caramel miscuts / upside down backs -\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=278655[/url]\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=282330[/url]\n\n\nThanks in advance and looking forward to some responses!
