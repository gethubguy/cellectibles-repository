      "post_content": "Hello Joe,\n\nI've watched the Detroits pretty close and believe all the 1887 Detroit poses were issued as GQ with exception of Stump Weidman as he had left the team by late 1887.  However, not all the poses have been catalogued.  With their population being so low, many have been lost to time.\n\nIf I go by the 0 number, the following are catalogued as GQs\n\n0487 Thompson\n0488 Thompson\n0489 Twitchell\n0490 Twitchell\n0491 Twitchell\n0492 Ganzel\n0494 Ganzel\n0496 Rowe\n0497 Rowe\n0498 Richardson\n0499 Richardson\n0501 Hanlon\n0502 Hanlon\n0503 Hanlon\n0504 Brouthers\n0505 Brouthers\n0506 Brouthers\n0507 Watkins\n0508 Thompson\n\nSo the missing numbers that are waiting to be discovered are as follows:\n\n0485 Thompson\n0486 Thompson\n0493 Ganzel\n0495 Rowe\n0500 Richardson\n\nThe players that have all their poses accounted for as GQs would be Twitchell (3), Hanlon (3), Brouthers (3), and Watkins (1).",
