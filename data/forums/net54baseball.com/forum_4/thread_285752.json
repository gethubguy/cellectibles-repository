Do you happen to know if there is a digital version of this that I could buy/use just for reference as I cannot seem to find very many resources to identify publishing years?  My apologies if this comes across as a rude question, I definitely do not mean it that way.  I am just trying to learn more.\n\nThank you and have a great Friday!\n\nRobbie",

Publishing years for a specific postcard us not listed in the guide.  The year is typically estimated based upon the type of postcard, prelinen, prelinen white border, linen, chrome, continental along with the view of the ballpark and what features may or not be present.  Such as newer seating, background buildings, auto styles, clothing styles signage, exterior/interior painting..... For real photo postcards the stamp block design is a key for estimating the date the postcard was produced.  Feel free to PM me with any specific questions.  Good luck with your collection.  Thank you.  Jim",
