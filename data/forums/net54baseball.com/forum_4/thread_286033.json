There seem to be more Detroit OJ collectors than any other team and we sometimes knock each other out but it is all good.  Send me email, I may be able to help you out.  Would like to learn more about what you have collected and what your goals are for 19th century Detroits.\n\n[url]detroitwolverines@gmail.com[/url]",
