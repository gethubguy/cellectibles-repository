      "post_content": "Hi - selling the pictured 1888 N162 card of Ed Andrews - really nice appearance on this one.  A spot of pulled paper / paper loss near his chin causes it to be downgraded to a 30.\n\nPrice is $SOLD delivered - PayPal F/F preferred but any of the regular payment methods accepted.\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
