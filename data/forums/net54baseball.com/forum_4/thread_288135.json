I was curious who the \"Stealing Home\" fellow was or was at least, in reference to;  Initially, I thought \"Shoeless\" Joe since he looked to be carrying his shoes, but found a Huggins and Scott Auction with the original comic and the player is named \"Bugs\" Raymond, who pitched for the Giants (through 1911) and died in 1912.  This may tighten the window of the postcard era.  I would surmise post 1911/12 due to his death and a subsequent name removal.
