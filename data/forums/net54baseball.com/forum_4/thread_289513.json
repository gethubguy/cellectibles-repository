      "post_content": "I am just taking a chance here that a member purchased a lot of 3 cabinet photos of Harvard players from the REA  2016 auction.  One of the players was identified as Ernst.  If someone here has it and is willing to part with it I would be interested in buying it, or trading for it if they prefer.\nI am also seeking Harvard related baseball items from 1865 to 1879, including letters, photos, and ephemera.  \nThank you",
