      "post_content": "The postcard is depicting Millbrook Stadium used by the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Ohio State League.  The team was in action from 1909-1915, so it dates from that era.  Billy Southworth was first depicted on a postcard with the Cobblers.  I think its depiction of the industrial/small town feel of the era is great.  There is a color version of this postcard, but this B&W one is exceedingly rare.  SOLD net to me, postpaid in the U.S.\n\n[url]seablaster@yahoo.com[/url]\n\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]",
