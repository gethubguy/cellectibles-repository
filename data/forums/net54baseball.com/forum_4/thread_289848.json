But it is possible I might miss something.  Just being honest, as oversights do happen even though we try not to make them.\n\nPlease make your own determination as to the severity of the flaws.  \n\nI do not appreciate negative surprises with items I buy, and so I do not want you to experience such when purchasing this card.\n\nDescription:\n\nNice, clear image, with decent contrast.\n\nLight crease beginning towards middle of top edge, extending downward towards hands.  Full extent of crease is more noticeable on the back, than it is on the front.\n\nInk on front of uniform. Small oval stain on back. Well rounded corners.\n\nMiscellaneous dark mark(s) along front left border (half way down), and on back.\n\n ***SOLD *** Price:  $200, and I cover shipping via U.S.P.S. Priority Mail. *** SOLD ***\n\nI would prefer payment via Paypal Family & Friends, but would accept check or money order (which must clear before I ship).\n\nFirst person to contact me that they'll take it, and pays for it, gets it. \n\nThanks\nVincent\n.\n.`",
