      "post_content": "This is actually a pretty amazing card - the front looks NM with sharp corners, great centering and a sharp clear image. Very fresh looking with no dirtiness or soiling. The back reveals a small crease across the card about 1/4 of the way down and a little tape mark in the middle. Definitely one of the more beautiful examples I have seen - $9000.",
