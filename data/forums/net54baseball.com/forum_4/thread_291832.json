      "post_content": "Offered here is a photo of a ragtag baseball team . The men look like they are from the 19th Century with the Clothes, Hats, and Mustaches. It could be somewhere around 1900 as well. There are 3 bats, a ball and what appears to be possibly a catchers mask in the picture .These guys dont look like professionals. There is a game going on in the background in the open field which is a nice aspect of the photo. The cabinet measures 6 1/2\" wide x 5 1/2\" high with the image being 4 1/2\" x 3 3/4\" . There are no creases . There is some light spots in the border and on the back. Very interesting item whose date a whereabouts are somewhat of a guess.
