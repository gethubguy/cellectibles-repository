      "post_content": "$225 Full house at the game great sweaters being worn and has umpire behind the pitcher. Cyanotype cabinets r rare and always blue in color and very seldom seen with baseball images especially a game action...I would say turn of the century $225 (has a pin hole at the top) 5 1/4 by 4 1/4...i think they sold a set of the University of Illinois player cabinets in an old Huggins and Scott auction...\n\nThe 1904 sheet music from Univ of Illinois Loyalty Song has the same stadium in it with white wall if not the same pic just different angle...if interested i can email u the pics of that I got online.",
