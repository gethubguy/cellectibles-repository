Excitingly, within days I was able to purchase a collection of the cards I was looking for (thanks Marty).  I've read a lot on the forum but this was my first time venturing out to actually purchase something.  Great experience and I'm glad this site/forum exists for us collectors who want to share our passions and be able to actually obtain the cards we love without the extra cost from places like ebay.",
