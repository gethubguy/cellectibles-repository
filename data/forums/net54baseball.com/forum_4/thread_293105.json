      "post_content": "In a baseball career that spanned 10 years from 1904 through 1914 Jim Byrnes had a major league cup of coffee in 1906 playing 10 games for the Philadelphia Athletics. He went on from there to play for various PCL and NW league teams appearing on the 1910 T212-2 Obak with Tacoma.\nOffered today is pretty special, at least to me. Here is the 1906 Sporting Life Team postcard of the Philadelphia AL team While Jim Byrnes is not pictured among the players the inscription is what I find interesting It reads:\n\n\u201cSept. 3, 1907\nJim,\nHere are your old teammates. How do they look? Guess we get another flag.\n/s/ Unknown\u201d\n\nThe card is postally used with a green Ben Franklin 1 cent stamp and is addressed to Mr. James Byrnes in San Francisco\nAttached is the postcard and his 1910 Obak card.\n I\u2019m asking $400 paypal f/f for the two and am pretty firm.\nEmail ONLY, no DM\u2019s, no posts to this thread.
