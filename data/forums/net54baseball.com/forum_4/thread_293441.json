The backs are printed in either green or blue with a short player bio and career statistics as well as the typical postcard information. Rarities include Jim Konstanty, Elston Howard and Casey Stengel with the scarcest of them all being Gil Hodges. Oversized versions (approximately 9\u201d by 12\u201d) also exist for the Mickey Mantle and Phil Rizzuto and the Johnny Sain card displays an advertisement for an Arkansas Chevrolet dealership.
