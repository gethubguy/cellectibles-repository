      "post_content": "Cabinet by the William Miller Studios in Minneapolis of N172 player Joseph A. Miller during his 1889 - 1891 tenure with the Western Association Minneapolis Millers.\n\nA few tack/staple holes do not really detract from the overall plus condition of the front of this beautiful deckle-edged offering. Clean back.\n\nWill trade for any Old Judge N172 of Joe Miller except 324-2 (stooping, hands at ankles).\n\nEmail to [url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url]",
