I have st least one and will post an image.[/QUOTE]I am a collector of the local history in the town where I live (Hopatcong, NJ). Miss Lotta was a famous summer resident here, building a \"cottage\" (mansion) in a very exclusive community here on the lake around the turn of the century (or shortly before). There's even a boat that does cruises for passengers around the lake called the Miss Lotta, named after her. I actually proposed to my wife on it. As such, I have become mildly obsessed with collecting anything to do with her. Also, now that it's getting harder and harder to find (or afford) any Hal Chase items I still need, I'm focusing my collecting on her more these days. \n\nMike\n\nSent from my SM-G950U using Tapatalk",
