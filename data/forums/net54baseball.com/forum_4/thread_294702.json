      "post_content": "Selling off my N28 complete non-baseball set.  Look back at my previous posts to see that this is legit.  The economy is forcing my hand; I already sold all of the baseball cards several months ago via PWCC.\n\nI am also including the pictured Allen & Ginter Virginia Brights Crop of 1887 pack.  It is in excellent condition, except for some writing on the exterior.  The inner shell is in great shape for the age.\n\nI am asking $1,150 shipped.  \n\nThe cards are raw and low-grade.  There is definitely some trimming on certain cards, including Annie Oakley, and back damage from scrapbooking abounds.  Net54 only allows me to upload low-res photos, so if you email me, then I can provide many more higher-resolution pictures for you to see on your own terms.\n\nEmail is best,\n\nRichard",
