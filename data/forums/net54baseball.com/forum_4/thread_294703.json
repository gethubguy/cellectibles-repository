      "post_content": "Selling off my 44/44 complete non-baseball set of N29 Allen & Ginter 2nd series.  Check my previous posts to see that I collected these several years back.  I sold the 6 baseball cards on PWCC months ago.\n\nThere are several nice graded cards, but by and large it's a low-grade set.  There is some trimming on certain cards.  Plenty of back damage on some cards from scrapbooking, etc.\n\nNet54 only allows me to post low-res photos, so if you email me, then I can send you plenty more higher-resolution photos for you to investigate on your own terms.\n\nI am asking $1,250 shipped.  Email is best method of communication w/me.",
