I am putting together a personal set of all of the Triple Crown winners in history. Here are a few photos of what they look like. If anyone has one available or knows of one, please do reach out. I would appreciate the help.\n\nThanks and be well. \n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=436522&d=1611265403[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=436523&d=1611265467[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=436524&d=1611265505[/IMG]",
