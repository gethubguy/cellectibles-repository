      "post_content": "TRADED I got this 1882 NY Clipper Woodcuts Buck Ewing years ago, but it doesn't really fit in with my collection. Beautiful condition. I've seen it referred to as his rookie card, but I know this isn't exactly a \"card\". No idea what to ask for it, so I'm open to cash or trade offers. Thanks!\n\nSorry for the reflections!\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kFLJrc][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50989542157_bf77810fec.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kFLaQz][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50989432501_a9076dd283.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kFLaHL][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50989432106_10f7cce328.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2kFLaU2][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50989432701_899f90239a.jpg[/img][/url]",
