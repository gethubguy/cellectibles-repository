      "post_content": "Steve, too bad that Sullivan wasn't in uniform.  But then again if he were in uniform, it'd be a heck of a lot more than the $500 asking price, which IMO is more than reasonable.  Anyone want to make a pool on how long this piece is on the BST before it sells?  I'm giving it less than a couple days.  \n\nNice cabinet - Should be an easy sale!",
