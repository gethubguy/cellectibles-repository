Decent colors, light stain bleeding through to front, diagonal crease in upper left corner of cap, tip of mustache missing.\n\nPrice:  $295 firm, postage paid.  Will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail.\n\n\nI would prefer payment via Paypal Family & Friends, but would accept check or money order (either which must clear before I ship).\n\nFirst person to reserve and pay via Paypal buys it.\n\nMy thanks.\nVincent",
