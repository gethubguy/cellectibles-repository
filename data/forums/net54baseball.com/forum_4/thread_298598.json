      "post_content": "FS - Group of five RPPCs of the 1910 Bennington (Vermont) baseball team. I haven't done a ton of research on these, but I do know Bennington was part of the semi-pro Four-City League.\n\nGroup includes a team RPPC, three cards of individual players, and one of the team mascot. I don't believe any of these guys made it to the major leagues, but the catcher Burrington was a star at the University of Vermont alongside battery-mate (and future Red Sox pitcher) Ray Collins. The group of RPPCs also include a few scrapbook clippings from the 1910 Bennington season.\n\nGood condition on all postcards. Fronts are great, with some glue residue and small spots of damage of the backs. \n\nInteresting items for Vermont and northeast baseball collectors.\n\nPrice for group: $SOLD shipped (paypal) \n\nPM or email with interest. \n\nEmail: semloh00 (at) yahoo.com\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger photos:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/nwX8h8r][img]https://i.ibb.co/4FbgBgW/Bennington-Sullivan-Burrington-RPPC-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/bH8wJHX][img]https://i.ibb.co/FsjZVsz/Bennington-Sullivan-Burrington-RPPC-rev-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/N9KYx76][img]https://i.ibb.co/F5z76nb/Bennington-Heath-Mascot-RPPC-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/gdwfY2q][img]https://i.ibb.co/ZSKF9j4/Bennington-Heath-Mascot-RPPC-rev-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/m908BDW][img]https://i.ibb.co/pfQyP0F/1910-Bennington-team-RPPC-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/FgtcTGq][img]https://i.ibb.co/SRpHCq7/Bennington-team-RPPC-rev-sm.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/ZmTqnz0][img]https://i.ibb.co/6Bsj30k/Bennington-clips-sm.jpg[/img][/url]",
