Decent colors, with reverse stain lightly bleeding through to front of card.\n\nThere is a diagonal crease in corner of cap, vertical crease downward from left shoulder, and tip of mustache missing.\n\nPrice: ***SOLD*** $295 firm, postage paid. Shipped using USPS Priority Mail.\n\n\nI would prefer payment via Paypal Family & Friends, but would accept check or money order (either which must clear before I ship).\n\nFirst person to reserve and pay gets it.\n\nMy thanks.\nVincent\n.",
