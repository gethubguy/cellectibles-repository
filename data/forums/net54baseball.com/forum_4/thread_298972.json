If you didn't look closely at the tin, you could easily miss the fact that this was sold by the Imperial Tobacco Company (part of the British-American Tobacco Co.), exclusive distributors for the Goodwin products in the UK.\n\nA little worn in spots, but decent shape. No serious rust issues. Top of lid is the only exterior surface that is a little light. Would be a great companion piece to any Old Judge cards you might have.\n\n[STRIKE]$125 net to me.[/STRIKE]$100 net to me.\n[url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url]",
