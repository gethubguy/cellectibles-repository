      "post_content": "FS: c1908 RPPC signed and annotated with career history by Harry Howell, pitcher credited with the first win in New York AL franchise history with the Highlanders in 1903. Howell is a rare autograph, and this one is a beauty on a Bell & Palfrey, St. Louis RPPC picturing Howell at spring training with the St. Louis Browns in 1908. I can't imagine there is a better signed Howell piece than this one. There is no autograph cert with the postcard but authenticity is absolutely guaranteed forever. \n\nRPPC size: 3.5\" x 5.5\"\n\nPrice: $SOLD shipped\n\nPM or email with interest.\n\nEmail: semloh00 (at) yahoo.com\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger scans:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/wyD1RV8][img]https://i.ibb.co/zsKwrpC/Howell-RPPC-750-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/C0kWrms][img]https://i.ibb.co/5cN27Gx/Howell-RPPC-750-r.jpg[/img][/url]",
