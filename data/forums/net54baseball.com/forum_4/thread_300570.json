Shows the Novelty Cutlery Photo Studio in the lower left corner where (arguably) the set was produced. \nInk mark in the upper left hand corner and \"2110\" in pencil on verso.  Other than that it's in great shape.\n\n$Sold pp/ff I'll cover shipping.  \"I'll take it\" supersedes negotiations.\nThanks for looking.\n_",
