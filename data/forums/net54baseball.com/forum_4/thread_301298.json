Would be nice for someone who has no interest in getting it graded. Would also consider selling it but mainly looking to trade plus cash for a nicer Cobb postcard. PM or email me at [url]pianni89@gmail.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=455807&d=1620042843[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=455808&d=1620042849[/IMG]",
