      "post_content": "I recently purchased these two cabinet cards of Henry \"Farmer\" Vaughn, catcher for the Louisville Colonels and Cincinnati Red Stockings and popular N172 subject, from Hunt Auctions. They were consigned by the Vaughn family. The total was $2135.\n\nI'm keeping the one on the left for my Louisiana card collection. The one on the right is available. You can look through the listings of recently completed auctions with Hunt as there were several other Vaughn cabinets for comparison. [STRIKE]$850[/STRIKE]. SOLD",

      "post_content": "See below for new front and back scans. There is a fingerprint visible on the back along the right edge -- likely belonging to Vaughn himself, albeit nearly impossible to confirm at this point, but it was found by the Vaughn family along with the Souby Cabinet (see above), and these were only distributed to the Pelicans players themselves.",
