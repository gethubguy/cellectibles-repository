You had to send in for the set , consisting of eight pictures of the biggest current names in American sports ( five baseball players , one woman\ngolfer , and two big names from mid-west football )...........I'm told that this exact pose is available on a postcard , or at least a postcard-sized photo , but I'm not finding any ;....Do any of you have one ?..Does such a RPPC actually exist , have you seen one  ? --I would appreciate any leads on where one might be for sale or trade. Thanks.....( P S .....it might not be the exact same white ink  signature or on that exact same spot....)....Thanks for any help , guys\n.\n.\n\n..",
