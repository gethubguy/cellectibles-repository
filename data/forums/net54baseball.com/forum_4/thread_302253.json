      "post_content": "McCormick N172 with a much better than average image for this player. Card is an SGC 10 due to added glue and scrapbook residue.  No paper loss.  On the scarce list and a fighting chance to get into the HOF due to the recent efforts of a sportswriter.  Read: McCormickForTheHall.com. Better scans available upon request.  PM me with your email address. Thanks for looking.\nAngyale\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=30966[/IMG]",
