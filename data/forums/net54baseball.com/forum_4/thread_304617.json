      "post_content": "FS: 1889 E.R. Williams Game cards, all PSA graded.  These are among the higher graded examples in the population report.  VCP does not show a lot of sales of the game cards, unlike the cards depicting contemporary players, which are pretty unique and interesting.  All prices are Paypal, net to me.  Shipping is $3.70 for one card, $4.70 for two, and free for 3 or more.  PM me.  Sorry for the horizontal photos (don't know how to correct that!!).  Thanks!!!!!!\n\n#1 Batter Out at First - PSA 8 NM/M = $125\n#3 Batter Out on Fly - PSA 8 NM/M = $125\n#6 Runner Nearest Home - PSA 8oc NM/M -- have TWO of these - $75\n#18 Error By Infielder - PSA 7 NM = $75\n#21 Wild Pitch - PSA 7 NM = $75",
