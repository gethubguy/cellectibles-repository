      "post_content": "Hi Everyone,\nAvailable for sale is a 1933 Babe Ruth Real Photo Postcard & Matching Photo. Postcard (first photo) is beautiful, not postally used but does have a small amount of writing on the back. Stamp box is DOPS. The matching 6\" x 4\" photo (second photo) also has a small amount of writing on the back. The notes on the reverse of both pieces mention Babe Ruth was photographed with a fellow named Russell in the winter of 1933. An awesome pair in my opinion! I can get some back photos up later today. Price for the pair is \"SOLD\", PM or post if interested and thanks for looking.\nJeff",
