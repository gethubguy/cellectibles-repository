Dont know what to ask for it so i\u2019m considering reasonable offers.  I realize REA is ending tomorrow and I probably should have waited to post it until the auction is over.  Thanks for looking.  For reference, an SGC 86 went for 31k in Heritage about a year ago.  My cards image is nicer but the corners are obviously not as nice.  Pm me with your email for more info.\n\nAngyale\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=26643[/IMG]",
