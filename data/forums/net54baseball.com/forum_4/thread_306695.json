      "post_content": "Some really interesting details. Tom Sharkey who's in a boxing robe is 57 at this point. Jack Sharkey (no relation) in the suit is 28 and in his prime. Pat Maguire is NOT the well-known Irish boxer Paddy Maguire who wasn't even born until 1936. Can't figure out who that Pat Maguire is! May have been some sort of promotion for the Jack Sharkey, Young Stribling fight which happened in Miami shortly thereafter.\n\nInteresting note the original promoter died and the boxing commission appointed Jack Dempsey to replace him. Jack Sharkey (who was actually Lithuanian) Took his boxing name from his two heroes, Jack Dempsey and Tom Sharkey.",
