      "post_content": "Offered here is a very nice 1909 Boston Bloomer Girls Postcard . The Postcard is unused and graded an SGC 3. it looks more like excellent to me. The players are in B B Dark uniforms surrounded by period, vintage pennants, bats and balls. On the bottom it says Greetings from The Boston Bloomer Girls. It has excellent clarity , centering and contrast. Some honest light corner wear is all I can see here. Great item.  \n234.99 plus 6.00 for actual usps shipping with tracking",
