      "post_content": "Vintage 1908 Detroit Tigers \"Our Home Team\" postcard featuring accordion fold out images of the Detroit Tigers, including hall of fame outfielders Sam Crawford and an early career Ty Cobb. The \"Our Home Team\" postcards were believed to have been only created for 5 teams, The Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, St Louis Cardinals, St Louis Browns, and the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers won the pennant in 1908, but were defeated in the World Series by the Cubs. A wonderful and rare unused postcard.  Please note that the green \"Our Home Team\" cover is detached,(see photos for condition as they are part of the description) but otherwise, the postcard remains in great condition for being 113 years old.\n\nAsking $old delivered \n\nyou can email me direct at [url]relicsportsllc@gmail.com[/url]",
