It's on my bucket list and thought I'd check.  Would also be interested in an 1894 N302 Mayo card if someone has one.\nThanks,\nChris\n\n[IMG]https://prewarcardsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/n162-beecher.jpg?w=860[/IMG][IMG]https://cconnect.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1894-Mayo-Cut-Plug-Football-Anson-Beard.jpg[/IMG]",
