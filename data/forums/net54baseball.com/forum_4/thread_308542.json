There are some out there but they are few and far between.\n\nYour most likely option for a Detroit cabinet would be a 19th century cabinet of a Detroit Wolverine, 1881-1888.\n\nOptions include:\nN173 Old Judge cabinets\nTomlinson Cabinets - Portraits & Action Poses, also large format team pics\nAnd several others such as . . .\n  - Gray Studio or Fearnaught's Studio proofs for Goodwin & Co.\n  - Police Gazette\n  - Etc.",
