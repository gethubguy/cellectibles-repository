      "post_content": "Awesome postcard for the first year of Forbes Field. Great Content  where the writer mentions the new stadium and the Pirates to his father. What\u2019s really interesting is that this is postmarked game three of the World Series. The Pirates are in Detroit for game three on October 11. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to believe that the person got this postcard at Forbes Field in game two and sent it! \n\nGreat piece of pirates in baseball history. Cobb versus Wagner and the start of a new era in Pittsburgh. \n\n45 shipped. Pm to reserve. Thank you all. Scott\n\nPS: Red tint is not an issue with postcard!",
