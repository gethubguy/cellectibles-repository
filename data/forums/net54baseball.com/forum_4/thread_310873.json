Mickey Welch, John Ward, Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe\n2. John Ward\n3. Jim Mutrie, Ledell Titcomb, Art Whitney, and a child mascot\n4. Elmer Foster, William Brown, Bill George, Mike Tiernan\n5. Mike Slattery, Pat Murphy, Ed Crane, Gil Hatfield\n\n(As you might guess from the names above, I've been focusing on 19th century New York Giants lately.) \n\nIf you have any to sell, I'm happy to discuss any of these cards in virtually any condition.

      "post_content": "Personally I think these are hugely under valued so I'm sitting on mine and waiting for a time when PSA/SGC/BVG comes up with a larger holder.  If you can slab these pages... My guess is the prices will go up 3-5x current values.  I have 4 Cap Anson pages and feel like these are ridiculously low for such a rare item.  The lithography is AMAZING on these cards.  5yrs ago T205s were the the little brother to the T206 set... Have you seen some of the prices for high end T205 cards lately.... in some cases out pacing Big Brother T206 cards.  A35 album pages will have their day!!!!",
