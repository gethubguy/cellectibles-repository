      "post_content": "Ungraded, but would likely be assessed as a \"Poor\" or \"Good\" example by a third party grader despite its relatively normal appearance. \n\nThe right edge has a somewhat rougher-looking cut than the left edge, but the card still measures the standard 1.5 inches x 2.75 inches. I will refund your purchase price if it is returned to you as having been trimmed. There is a small bit of paper loss on the upper left edge (even with his hat) that is almost undetectable to the naked eye. There appears to be some \"schmutz\" on the right lapel of his jacket. I did not want to damage the card by trying to remove it. As you can see, neither of these issues materially impacts the overall appearance of the card. Very minor rounding to the corners. Rear exhibits minor staining and paper loss from album removal.\n\nI probably didn't do myself any favors by making the pictures so large since it over-exaggerates the flaws. The card really does look pretty decent in person.\n\n$1000 net to me delivered insured ***SOLD***\n\nKevin Cummings\n[url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url]",
