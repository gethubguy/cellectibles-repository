      "post_content": "This postcard has been discussed several times here on Net54, as our own Leon and another member both have one as well.  I believe not many others are known.  It was figured out by members that the gentleman between them is Dick Mayes.  I think it is neat that this one provides more detail in period writing on the back, describing exactly what is going on.\n\nThe borders on this one are trimmed, as it measures approximately 3 1/4\" by 4 3/4\".  Still well balanced and great eye appeal.  The image is just tremendous.\n\nSOLD delivered, net to me, with PayPal preferred.\n\nPlease PM or email me at [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or with any questions.  Thanks and Happy New Year!",
