      "post_content": "A.G. Spalding & said to be Cap Anson I believe, player in Chicago uniform, on the front.  \n\nLooks to be blank backed, even though on the front there is a little icon on the lower right that says \"members of the Chicago Baseball Team\".   So bit of a mystery why this is blank backed.  \nI held it up to the light and no players show through.   \n\nA one-off?  A prototype? A very neat & rare item none-the-less.\n\nVideo on YouTube on these:\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSz_fGxKwnM[/url]\n\n\n$700 or best offer shipped (Check or Paypal F&F preferred)",
