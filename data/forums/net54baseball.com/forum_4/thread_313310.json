The rear has some rusting around the perimeter of the metal base, but the paper insert is present and intact with all the wording legible. Despite its flaws, the pin is quite presentable. \n\nThe Smith is a beauty. No staining, no rusting, clear photo. Smith was one of the first players to reinvent himself in the minor leagues as a field player (for 10 years with 5 teams) after blowing his arm out as a pitcher for 4 years with Cincinnati. Check him out here:  [url]https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smithel01.shtml[/url]\n\nGoar   $275/OBO\nSmith  $575/OBO\n\nNet to me for Insured Priority Mail shipping to you.\n\n[url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url] for questions/comments",
