I had another one for sale a few years back and now it\u2019s time for me to sell this one. I believe there\u2019s probably only maybe 3 to 5 known.\n\nI am currently accepting offers, please contact my email below, serious inquiries only.\n\nRegards,\n\nJeff\n[url]Jeffissurfing@gmail.com[/url]",

I have not been this excited about a card in a long time, and that includes the E107 set.  Field of Dreams is one of my favorite movies, I have been to the field and I love that Moonlight Graham really existed, really only played 2 innings (never batted), really was a doctor in Minnesota and there is really a card of him!",

      "post_content": "This reminds me of the back in the days when people paid extra to have their Sports Collectors Digest issues sent overnight so they could jump on the best deals first. Or when I used to wake up at the break of dawn on Saturdays to hit the Nashville flea market to try and snag the best deals before the other collectors. Or trying to sneak in early at card shows to hit certain dealers first. Its actually kind of fun and exciting that rare and unique items pop up and are gone versus everything going via auctions. Congrats on an awesome card both to the prior owner and to the new caretaker! I love Net 54!",
