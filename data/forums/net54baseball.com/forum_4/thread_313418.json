      "post_content": "Beautiful piece of history loaded with stars of the day, among them Harry Stovey, Gus Weyhing, but especially HOF player and manager Wilbert Robinson. \n\nWith the exception of the unfortunate missing lower right corner, the card is in pretty decent shape for being 134 years old and displays quite well. The card measures 4 1/4\" x 6 3/8\". The blank back has a glue stain from likely having been mounted in a scrapbook, but it is otherwise pretty clean. The well-focused, bust-style images of the players in uniform give a great look at the members of this 19th century American Association team. All fourteen of the players on this cabinet have their own Goodwin & Company N172. Finding and paying for just Wilbert Robinson's card alone would likely cost more than I am asking for this cabinet! A rare opportunity!\n\n$2000 OBO net to me\n\n[url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url] for comments/questions",
