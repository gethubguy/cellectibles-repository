      "post_content": "SOLD: Circa 1884 Old Judge smoking head. Not sure if this is considered a trade card or window display. Size is about 4-1/4\" x 6-7/8\". These seem to be a fairly scarce but a popular item.\n\nCondition is good with some edge wear. Scrapbook glue staining on reverse. Color may be slightly faded, but not sure of that. Still looks pretty great regardless.\n\nPrice: SOLD shipped, paypal f/f preferred. The only other online sale I could find of this particular card in the set was an auction from a few years back at over $200.\n\nPM or email with interest.\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger scan:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/hYDLSv1][img]https://i.ibb.co/3RB4nHY/Old-Judge-Smoker-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/PGxFLtX][img]https://i.ibb.co/7tvjfbM/Old-Judge-Smoker-rev-s.jpg[/img][/url]",
