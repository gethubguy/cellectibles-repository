Shipping with signature and insurance included. \nA very rare card that doesn't come up for sale often, and a tough player to cross off of a HOF collection. Would like to sell here before taking to Ebay. I couldn't get the photos to upload so I attached a link to my flickr account. \n\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/188295891@N05/albums[/url]",
