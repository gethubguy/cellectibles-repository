      "post_content": "I recently won a lot of 13 postcards from Hunt's and only wanted two out of the bunch so I'm throwing in two to make it a lot of 13 again, make sense?  :D\n\nI'm also tossing in the set of 10 oversized postcard set from the \"Through the Royal Gorge\" White Sox of 1914.\n\nI'm not really interested in selling individually as that takes too much time, looking to sell as one lot.\nI also have back scans of each so let me know if you need to see any, most are postally used and from the 1900-30's.\n\nLooking for $400 or best offer.  Shipping on me.\nPayPal F/F or add 3%\n[url]speissig@hotmail.com[/url]",
