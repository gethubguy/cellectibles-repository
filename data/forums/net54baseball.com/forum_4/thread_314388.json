As you can tell, there are a couple of advertisers amongst them and the Home Run card is completely blank.\n\nWe have an additional set of these that is titled, as well as an almost set we would consider breaking up.  \n\nAsking $350 for this exact set, but will consider offers.  I\u2019m available via PM.\n\nI will be posting several other trade cards from different sets and singles (titled and untitled). Here is the link to all the scans and price list.\n\n[url]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16E-zLNz7AgaCfEf67S8a6tgJ89OuEcjt[/url]\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nJeff\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2mZVQdw][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51851371310_ffe2d89c26_b.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2mZUauk][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51851045919_b2d8240bb3_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
