      "post_content": "I recently purchased a large lot of 1980\u2019s postcards of early\n1900\u2019s players.  They appear to be images taken from photos and books.  I think they were made by Jim Rowe or George Brace.  The image quality isn\u2019t great, but it looks like someone wanted a postcard of every player who ever played during this era.  Is anyone interested?  If so, email me at [url]nortonnerd@msn.com[/url] for images.  Thank you.",
