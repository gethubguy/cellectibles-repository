Can\u2019t recall seeing one like this. \n\nSecond is an H804-10 \u201cA Fly\u201d which appears to be an advertisement for a game between Ex-Bay Cities vs First Ward Club in 1883\u2026.an actual baseball game it appears. Card is rougher condition but the advertisement is really cool. \n\nAsking $55 each including shipping.  I\u2019m available via PM to discuss.\n\nThanks!\nJeff\n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2n49aY7][img]https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/51887728586_b97760e920_b.jpg[/img][/url]",
