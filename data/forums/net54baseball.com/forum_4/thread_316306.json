But like I said, what do I know? Anyhoo, the card is beautiful!! And this is a tough HOF'er! The price is SOLD delivered PayPal F&F please. Thank you for checking out my sale.\n\nJoe K\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=506306&d=1646706759[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=506307&d=1646706769[/IMG]",

The label is identical to yours. In my orders it will say Evidence of Trimming if the graders thought it was trimmed. It won\u2019t specify this on the label. Hope this helps! \n\nDavid \n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
