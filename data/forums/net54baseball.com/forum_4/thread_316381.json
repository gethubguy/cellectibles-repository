Foxx was a 3x MVP (first player to do that), 2x Batting Champion, and a Triple Crown winner (1933).  He could hit for power and average - belting 534 home runs, with a .325 lifetime batting average.  Side-by-side, his credentials stack up to Lou Gehrig.\n\nThe corners of the post card were apparently lost to a photo album - still, great eye-appeal.",
