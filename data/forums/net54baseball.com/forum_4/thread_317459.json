      "post_content": "SALE PENDING\n\nFor sale is a H804-17 Blue Green Base trade card from 1887.  Can be dated to that year because of the schedule reverse from American Association Philadelphia Athletics and the National League Philadelphia Quakers.  Card is off center to the top but not miscut.  No creasing or wrinkling but does have a couple of minor discoloration marks on the reverse.  Price is $220 and includes shipping.  Mailed payment (check or money order) is preferred but I will accept PayPal F/F also. Please reserve at [url]old-baseball@sbcglobal.net[/url].\n\n[IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=142&pictureid=33070[/IMG]",
