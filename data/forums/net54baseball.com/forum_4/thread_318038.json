      "post_content": "Offered here 4 Postcards all from the same time period (around 1907 Japan). I had most of the Japanese printing translated\n\n\n\nPostcard 1 is 4 players from the Keio University Team pictured\nThis one is in great shape solid EX to Ex sold\n\n\nPostcard 2 is a team depicting League Champions. Postcard 3 has 3 flags. The far-left flag notes the (league) area, \u2018Tokai area and the printing translates to Aichi Bank Baseball Club, Championship $sold\n Sold\n\nPostcard 3 has one flag that notates league champions with the printing translating to Nagoya Business Baseball game players with a couple of small indentations bottom border\nSOLD\n\n \n\nPostcard 4 has a batter at the plate who appears African American but likely is a very dark Japanese. Hard to say. What is interesting is the advertising in the background on the Canopies is for Beer, Sake and Panasonic (not much has changed as advertising and sponsors were big in Japan too) as it is interesting to see sponsorships in Japan 110 years ago\n89.00\n\nAll appear to be Ex accept where noted on the first postcard. These prices are net prices to me. Please add 5.00 for shipping with tracking. Open to offers for the group",
