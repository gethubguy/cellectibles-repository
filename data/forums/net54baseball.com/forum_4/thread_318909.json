      "post_content": "Offered here is an N86 W. Duke Sons & Co Baseball scene from The Perilous Occupation set from 1888. The card is entitled A Bad Decision By The Umpire, which is printed on the bottom of the card . The scene is an umpire being chased by 4 guys while running off a baseball field. One wielding a bat, likely unhappy with some bad calls. A field and wall are present in the background. This is a card from the 50 scene Perilous Occupation 19th Century Tobacco Set. The set is fairly rare making the desirable baseball example the most collectible. It is a PSA 4 with some edge toning and touched corners. With the cost of grading and the time it takes these days getting a solid graded example is a better option then sending cards in if you are a graded card collectoR \nSOLD plus 5.00 for shipping with tracking net to me",
