      "post_content": "I thought I might start a new thread here asking for collectors of the old judge set who might have duplicate Hall of Fame cards and might be looking to liquidate - I haven\u2019t been lucky enough to add one of these to my Hall of Fame collection but have recently connected with some experienced collectors here who have offered great advice to me on the set/cards. \n\nI occasionally find some interesting ones at auction houses or on eBay, but the eBay marketplace is a little bit of an unpredictable sales experience (to put it nicely!)\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from some seasoned collectors here who might have some thoughts on how to best connect a new 19 century collector to my first or OJ Hall of Fame card.\n\nThanks all\n\nJeff",
