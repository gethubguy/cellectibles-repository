      "post_content": "I have a for sale a PC796 Honus Wagner, which is also known as the Sepia set, and lesser known as the Ben Jordan set. It is in an SGC 50 holder, HOWEVER THE HOLDER IS CRACKED OPEN AND IS TAPED TOGETHER. YOU WILL NEED TO REHOLDER, UNLESS YOU LIKE THE WAY IT IS NOW (WHICH I DO). THE CARD WAS NOT IMPACTED BY THE CRACK. \n\nI am asking $8,000 on this net to me. I think this is fair considering what the last A sold for. Please PM or email me at [url]pianni89@gmail.com[/url] if interested - thanks!!\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=518152&d=1653389928[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=518153&d=1653389933[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=518154&d=1653389938[/IMG]",
