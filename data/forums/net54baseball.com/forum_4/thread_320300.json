I have enjoyed them for a long time but I have reached the end of a couple of projects and it\u2019s time to sell. I have decided to keep the books guides and autographs. I am posting the cards here and some postcards in that section and the photos will go in the memorabilia section. It is not a fire sale and I believe that I have priced things fairly but would be willing to talk about group discounts for large purchases. \n\nThis postcard, which there are only a handful of copies, is in very nice shape and is crystal clear\n\nAsking 1750",
