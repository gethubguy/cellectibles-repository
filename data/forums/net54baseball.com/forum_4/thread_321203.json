      "post_content": "Instead of showing up on time to play for the NY Highlanders in 1907, Hal Chase stayed in California and managed one of the greatest college teams ever, the St. Mary's Phoenix, which went 26-0-1 against top college teams -- and beat the Chicago White Sox and Pacific Coast League all star team along the way.  On St. Mary's roster were future Hall of Famer Harry Hooper and future major leaguers Harry Krause and Ed Burns. Krause won 18 games and had a 1.39 ERA two years later for the A's. \n\nThis is an incredibly rare Chase item, postally used, with just two graded by SGC and PSA combined. This one isn't in the best shape but Chase's images are clear as is Hooper's -- whose first image on a major league card didn't come until two years later in 1909 in the form of a Colgan's Chip. Chase is at the top center in a suit and in the far left of the team picture in the middle of the postcard. \n\nThe other graded example of this card, an SGC 1, went for $9600, over four years ago at auction. This one can be yours for $XXX delivered. Email or PM if interested. \n\n[url=https://flic.kr/p/2nspJkz][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52151043567_6d3318155c_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2nsNNwy][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52155545236_8440cedddb_c.jpg[/img][/url]",
