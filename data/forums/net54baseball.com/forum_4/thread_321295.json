I guess it's 6 one way, half a dozen another - the other mistaken identity cards like the 87 Donruss Opening Day / 90 Donruss John Smoltz for example, I've always gone by the name (Bonds/Smoltz) instead of pic Ray/Glavine, but I wouldn't disagree one bit if someone said it the other way around. \n\nIt does remind me a couple of years ago, Topps called Shane Beiber \"Justin Beiber\" on the back of the card.  A 10 cent card (uncorrected, mind you) went for CRAZY money.  We cardboard crack addicts are crazy sometimes!",

It could have gone either way but I think when you look at how the card was made(first the image went on, then the name plate below) at least for Old Judges it made perfect sense for the image to govern. This is why we decided to continue with it in the Old Judge book. For most cards it doesn\u2019t matter value wise, but the Anson who isn\u2019t Anson should be a different story.",
