      "post_content": "Thanks..... interesting that when I looked up the Giants team roster for 1907 that the middle guy Mertes wasnt on the team that year.... he was traded mid season the year before!  So is the card lineup out of date???? No it is not!!! If you look closely at the bottom of the front, the card is a 1905 issue, but was mailed and postmarked in 1907.  Its fun to collect and research these items.... and as the seller pointed out to me, Mertes was the favorite player of Harpo Marx since he was supposedly \"the only one he could see\" from his look into the field from outside the stadium!!
