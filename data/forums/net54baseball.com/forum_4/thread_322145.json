It is an excellent looking card with all of the eye appeal of a five. It has the two tiny pinholes that will keep the price affordable for more collectors. A truly great value and super pose of arguably one of the best pitchers of all time. Great investment potential because of the value vs the eye appeal.[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20220714/0c84e914c0c55bfeee0c023ffa040e78.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSent from my TECNO LA7 using Tapatalk",

You show a 2.5 and have taken the description from the auction for a different card?\n\nThats not your card, it belongs to a friend of mine and is eBay.",
