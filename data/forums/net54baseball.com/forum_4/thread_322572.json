      "post_content": "I didn't plan on having to sell these Old Judge cards, but an unexpected breakup/divorce is causing me to have to liquidate some of my possessions. The plan was to send these to PSA once they brought prices and timelines back in order, that's why they are in card savers. \n\nNo idea on value, honestly. I hadn't planned on reselling them ever.\n\nSo toss me any offers on any of them. If they don't move, they will head to the bay in auction format. \n\n(pics here)\n[url]https://ibb.co/VDDVf5g[/url]\n[url]https://ibb.co/6H47Hnz[/url]\n[url]https://ibb.co/rQzDqFg[/url]\n[url]https://ibb.co/XJ973tM[/url]\n[url]https://ibb.co/bXS0Ns7[/url]\n[url]https://ibb.co/1Xp7YRJ[/url]\n\n#10 in my pictures: C.
