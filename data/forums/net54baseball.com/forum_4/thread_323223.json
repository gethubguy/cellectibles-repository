      "post_content": "Up for sale is an 1896 Whitehead & Hoag Political Pin of HOF executive Morgan Bulkeley.\n\nThis pin pre-dates the 1908 George E. Wright postcards by a whopping 12 years.  Some consider that postcard to be his \"rookie\" card.  Others might wait a lifetime for an 1890s Brady Cabinet (and then be willing to spend several hundreds of thousands of pennies to get it).  Or, you could pick up this good lookin' pin and be more than satisfied.\n\nSOLD delivered.\n\nPlease PM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.",
