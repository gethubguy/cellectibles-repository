      "post_content": "FS: Rare 1886 MacIntire Studio cabinet photo of Phillies pitching star Charlie Ferguson. Ferguson threw the first no-hitter in Phillies history and was a real star and fan favorite in a career cut tragically short by his death from Typhoid Fever in 1888. \n\nThis photo of Ferguson, along with other MacIntire Studio photos of his teammates, was used for the 1886 Lorillard's Philadelphia Quakers team card. \n\nCondition is excellent. Sharpness and contrast are A+.\n\nTaking this cabinet to another level, the reverse has handwritten retouching instructions by photographer James A. MacIntire, and is signed by him.\n\nSize 4.25\" x 6.5\"\n\nPrice: $SOLD shipped. Paypal or check.\n\nPM or email with interest.\n\nEmail: semloh00 (at) yahoo.com\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger scans:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/QPP799c][img]https://i.ibb.co/K22c66G/1886-Charlie-Ferguson-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/9bbZy5H][img]https://i.ibb.co/R33jQwT/1886-Charlie-Ferguson-rev-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n1886 Lorillard's (for reference only):\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/CHMtCT4][img]https://i.ibb.co/G5tJYbG/1886-Lorillards-Quakers-s.jpg[/img][/url]",

      "post_content": "Now that is one cool cabinet.  Studios such as MacIntire were well known for their craft, to have such notes in the photographer's own hand on a pose used on the Lorillard is super neat.  If this were an 1886 Detroit Wolverine portrait with notation from Frank Tomlinson I'd be at your mercy on price.\n\nGood Luck !",
