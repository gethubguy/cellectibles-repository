      "post_content": "1874 Cabinet Card of the Philadelphia Athletics Wes Fisler (credited with scoring the first run in NL history in 1876). Written at top in light pencil - Ret(urn) to Mr Murnane. Tim Murnane was Fisler's teammate and went on to a long career as the sportswriter for the Boson Globe. This cabinet card was likely what Murnane loaned out for the Globe and other publications to use in their woodcuts of the Athletics.\n\n$2,750. ~ Would also trade for a nice Civil War Confederate image \n\nRob M\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=531937&d=1661708040[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=531938&d=1661708049[/IMG]",
