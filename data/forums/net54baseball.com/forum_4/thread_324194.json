Apparently demand increased immediately after I sold it :-) In any event the registration really bothered me and all the baseball players and stars in my better set were vg/x and clean with good eye appeal. It's now my only set - the other went to REA - eventually I'll get a Kelly in my very reasonable range......\n\nNever makes me feel better that others are in the same boat - Fred I hope you manage to get yours as well.",
