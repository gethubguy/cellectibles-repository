I don\u2019t have my iPad near but it\u2019s white and has the Peerless Bread name with a picture of all the pennants in a circle in the left hand corner and Johnny Evers pennant on right corner . It\u2019s not made of paper I don\u2019t think and has a watermark of Sterling pressed into the material .",
