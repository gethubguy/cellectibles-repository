      "post_content": "Good afternoon everyone, \n\nI'm trying to clear out a few cards and raise money for some new things. Here I have for sale an extremely nice N86 Duke's Perilous Occupations card - \"A Bad Decision By The Umpire.\"\n\nA pretty tough and popular Baseball card to find in what is otherwise primarily a non-baseball set. Card is in extremely nice shape. Clean, no creases or major flaws. There is some little mark on the front of the card that I can't tell if it is pencil, or a print mark, or if it is supposed to be there. Regardless, this is a very nice example of this card.\n\nAsking $200 OBO\n\n[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX6cWMfQGvbS41CIuPBk5QFjmtao6Ihp8ZOu3v0WJL7vcqmlgKKVEooAn4rgi-1I1RUEUyi-4WNePACwmOi32k6Idshv3fS0AI3_NjxlWF0XXwx0FLVHWdobZfVcegmZAkgDpUU-OFuepSCinlubvD9Dw=w767-h575-no?authuser=0[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWyAiKCv7yBRneq0qqnkANBQnNzoCWRtki6pz4bw2dulq2NNmNGIOAqd-fY0QbbXMEk9VD3fG8sCOEf5zJ8gpH_X8DxwsaKYnE-UBYQ-tro4kFok1mI-GuSREBNfJEZWQ23-OkRjGicnn3Pn-kegJll1g=w432-h575-no?authuser=0[/IMG]\n\nI understand that (for reasons that I don't understand) this image may not be showing up for some people.
