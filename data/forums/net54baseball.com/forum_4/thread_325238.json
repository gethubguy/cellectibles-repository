Is it certain that the Varney images depict students at the Minnesota institution?",

      "post_content": "Nothing definitive to suggest that this was the Carleton College in MN other than the relative proximity to Chicago, although I must admit I thought the distance would be shorter than 400 miles.  The person who sold these to me mentioned the MN institution and I had no reason to think otherwise.\n\nSo, I suppose this could be the team from Missouri.  Ironically, Farmington, MO comes in a shade under 400 miles to Chicago.\n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019ve never spent much time researching these.",
