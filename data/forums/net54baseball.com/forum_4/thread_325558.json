      "post_content": "Offered for sale here is an 1889 N165 PSA 5 Base Ball Catcher card from the Games & Sports Series. This one is what you would expect from a recent PSA 5. It has sharp corners excellent color and clarity and is well centered and crease free. A comp I found is in this 2022 Winter Rarities from Memory Lane Auctions where and SGC 4 of the Fielder Card sold for 600.00 plus tax and shipping. \nLot # 537: 1887 Goodwin & Company N165 Base Ball Fielder Games And Sports Series SGC 4 VG-EX\n[url]https://memorylaneinc.com/site/bids/bidplace?itemid=66168[/url]\nThe Base Ball Catcher is a more desirable card from this set in my opinion that includes 4 \"Base Ball\" cards, Fielder, Catcher Pitcher and Batter as noted on the back. I think it interesting that Goodwin printed the word Base Ball as two words.\nNo Longer Available",
