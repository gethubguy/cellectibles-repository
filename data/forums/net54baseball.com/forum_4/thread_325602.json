      "post_content": "Offered here is a great card from a very difficult set.\n\nWhile certainly not as popular as the N172 issue, this is one of Clarksons rookie cards.\n\nPSA & SGC together have graded just 8 of these Ball at Chest versions. There is a PSA 7 out there somewhere but other than that one, this is the highest graded on record.\n\nIt is not often that a quality version of a scarce rookie card of a 19th century Hall of Famer is available. \n\nSee images below. PM with any questions or requests.\n\nPrice? Listening to offers\n\nPayPal preferred. Shipping and insurance is included in the price.",

Lipset called them \"Clarkson Pitcher Chicago\" and \"right arm extended, left arm near side\". I combine these and call them ball at waist, ready to throw and arm outstretched, throwing no ball visible. Nice card.",
