      "post_content": "Hi Everyone\n\nFor a Potential Sale or For Trade (or a Combo) The trade would be for Joe Jackson or Babe Ruth Cards.\n\nI am taking offers for my 1908 American League Publishing Co Ty Cobb Post Card.\n\nI know some do not like when we say taking offers (sorry to those but for this card that is how I am doing it)\n\nBeing Transparent I am also emotional attached to this card as both a Collector and do to its Rarity (less then 6 to 9 known to exist) so it will be hard for me to let go if I do\n\nFeel free to PM me",
