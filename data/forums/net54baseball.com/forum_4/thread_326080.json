Two players? Check. Both players mentioned by name in the label? Check. This card is a veritable cornucopia of variations!\n\nGraded by SGC as 10 - Poor (for light glue stains on the reverse, off-centeredness, and light wrinkles), this card of HOFer Tim Keefe and teammate Danny Richardson still presents quite well. \n\n$2250 net to me for Priority Mail/insured delivery to you. ***SOLD*** \nemail [url]kkkkandp@aol.com[/url] with questions.",
