I look at PWCC's weekly auction every week and their premier auction every time it opens -- as a prewar collector, I rarely find anything to bid on, and I have not bought anything from PWCC since they went off ebay.  PWCC, like Goldin, appear to be a prime source of modern stuff.  This card likely would have done much better in Heritage, REA, LOTG, Memory Lane, Mile High, Sterling, etc.  The card pictured above is a good looking example and someone got a great deal, I think",
