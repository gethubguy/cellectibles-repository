Finished up my T206 hometown Minneapolis and St. Paul set recently (pic attached from my Twitter account just for fun!) and figured it was time to dip my toe into the 19th century. Not looking for anything super high end, but would happily take a look at any Minneapolis or St. Paul folks have available. Thanks!",
