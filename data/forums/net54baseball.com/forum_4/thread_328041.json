Neither buyer paid. eBay continues to get worse.\n\nWill sell it here on the BST for SOLD delivered, with PayPal preferred.\n\nIt has some slight paper loss on the front and a vertical crease on the left side.\n\nPlease PM or email [url]kris.sweckard@sbcglobal.net[/url] to purchase or ask any questions.",
