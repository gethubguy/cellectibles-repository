I sold the two A&G sets but framed the album and I'm quite happy as they're up on the wall to be appreciated. Recently completed the master set of the Kimball's and Kelly the last N162 I need. Coupled with my indian set and world's smokers - I'm just about done except for that damn N43 I need...... Two cards are standing between me and let's say a more meditative state with regard to the hobby I love.",
