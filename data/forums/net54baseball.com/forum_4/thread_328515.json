If you're interested in something shoot me an offer, and I'm sure we can make a deal. The only two postcards that are not available are the 1909 Brush Ty Cobb and the C. 1930's Babe Ruth RPPC. Shoot me a PM if you're interested in adding a sweet postcard or two to your collection!\nJeff\n\n[url]https://imageevent.com/jeffintoronto/baseballpostcards;jsessionid=kwd9uakwh2.cat[/url][/QUOTE]\n\nWow You have a great vintage collection\n\nGLWS",
