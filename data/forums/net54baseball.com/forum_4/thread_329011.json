      "post_content": "So I decided to try to start a collection of H804s. I'm starting with the inexpensive, more common, sets (just to see if I can maintain my interest in them). So far I've got some of the Capadura Cigars (H804-4), a bunch of Merchant's Gargling Oil (H804-7 - though now I see there's a nice full-color variant series), some Corner Clefs (H804-10), and some scattered individuals from other sets.\n[IMG]https://www.oldcardboard.com/o/h/h804/h804-07-gargling/a-1.jpg[/IMG]\nI also have some extras, but again, nothing exciting as I've been focusing on the cheaper end of things.\n\nAfter finishing scouring ebay, now I'm wondering if anybody here has any for sale.\nThanks",

For example, these two are from H807-C by \"Gies & Co\", yet the shading is darker on the figure on the right.\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/N9x2jF1/H804-7C.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAnd here are two I found from H807-A, by \"Clay & Richmond.\" Here, clearly, the one on the right doesn't have the typical \"Gargling Merchant Oil\" ad, and the writing on the baseball player's belt is also totally different, let alone shading differences (especially noticeable on his shoes)\n\n[IMG]https://i.ibb.co/LzQgNPS/H804-7E.jpg[/IMG]",
