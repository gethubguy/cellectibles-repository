      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nbeen a while since I collected baseball cards, but I just had my first book published titled [URL=\"https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/baseballs-union-association/\"]Baseball's Union Association[/URL], and thought it would be neat to get an Old Judge of a player who appeared in the league. \n\nBy my count 60 UA alumni appear in the N172 set.\n\nFred Dunlap would be my number one choice, but am interested in any alumni.\n\nAlso would be interested in the Dunlap N162 as well.\n\nFeel free to message me.\n\nthanks Justin",
