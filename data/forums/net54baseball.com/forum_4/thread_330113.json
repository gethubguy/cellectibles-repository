I have seen examples of this postcard postmarked prior to Ruth\u2019s arrival in Boston. Pretty cool image, nonetheless.\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230110/86614ce00a86d3b5e61f88be4e158ceb.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230110/506a08da6d618ef7f37988d37c598ec9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
