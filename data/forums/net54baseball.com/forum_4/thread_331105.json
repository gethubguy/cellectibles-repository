      "post_content": "It may be a long shot but, as a lower grade collector, these two gems are a little too nice for me. They are NOT for sale, just hoping someone may have the same card in lower grade with decent eye appeal, preferably Authentic or 1 (PSA or SGC but emphasis on eye appeal) and would be interested in upgrading with cash. These cards don\u2019t change hands too often but I did find a Heritage Brouthers SGC 2.5 that sold in July for just under $4K and a Ewing PSA 3 sold in REA a few months ago for $1800. I\u2019m not attempting to cherry pick sales, (I know this has been discussed recently) and I\u2019m not glued to these results. Just concerned with RECENT results (not outdated prices from before things went nuts). If you have other recent sales for comparison I\u2019m all ears. Just hoping there might be a deal that works for both of us.\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230202/22dd8fac3e83132a25e5312daff66791.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230202/c6245fa330546ce59c02a422de4716b6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230202/050a1c53f4efc48e9a1ea6685cbf22e1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230202/e277dca4057885e8eee41ac3db719e14.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
