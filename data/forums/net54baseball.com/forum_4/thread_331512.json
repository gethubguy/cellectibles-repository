The postcard itself may have been produced in 1912.",

Navin Field was built on the same site as Bennett Park where the Tigers had played beginning in 1895 and was also located at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.  \n\nOn the other hand, you would think if it was commemorating that event, they would have mentioned it on the card somewhere.\n\nLove the card BTW Joe.\n\nEdit: Based on the attached picture and where the Flagpole is located relative to the outfield bleachers, the picture sure looks like it was taken at Navin Field.",

(The people in the bleachers are arranged almost identically in the two images, and the debris in the foreground also matches.)  I think that Jim \"Deacon\" McGuire is the balding man in a sweater who has just taken his cap off (second from the right among the Tiger personnel), and he did not join the Detroit coaching staff until 1912.",
