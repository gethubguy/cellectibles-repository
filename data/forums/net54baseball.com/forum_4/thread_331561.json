      "post_content": "Well, the 2nd Mid-Atlantic Get Together + Trade Event will be in my backyard, but it doesn't look like I'll be able to attend. \n\nSo, I wanted to spread out my wares here virtually and show what I would have brought to trade. Not super eager to move these, but potentially interested in trading for any T206 Brooklyn off-backs I need. (I might push in the whole pot for the right T206 Matty portrait.)\n\nThanks for looking, and hope everyone who does attend the event has a great time!\n\n(Terry is no longer available.)",
