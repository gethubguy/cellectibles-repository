      "post_content": "FS: 1884 Providence Grays team supplement from the Sunday Dispatch newspaper (Rhode Island). The supplement has been pasted onto the detached inside back cover of a 19th century scrapbook (1876 patent date), with the top and bottom parts of the supplement cut down to fit the dimensions of the scrapbook. This supplement seems to be quite scarce and I've only been able to locate one other copy, also cut down. As issued, \"Providence Grays\" was in a white section at the top along with the year 1884. Here, \"Providence Grays\" has been cut and pasted onto the main image field. \n\nEarly Grays piece, with Hoss Radbourn, Charlie Sweney, Arthur Irwin and the rest of the team.\n\nIf anyone has any further info about the piece, e.g. exact date of distribution, feel free to post. \n\nCondition is generally good with light staining and foxing. Please see photos below.\n \nPrice: $SOLD OBO shipped. Zelle or paypal G/S.\n\nPM with interest.\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger scans:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/ccKXFWD][img]https://i.ibb.co/Z6R18QW/IMG-0013.jpg[/img][/url]\n<b>\n[url=https://ibb.co/7k2PSk2][img]https://i.ibb.co/WVgZHVg/IMG-0006.jpg[/img][/url]\n<b>\n[url=https://ibb.co/YDWR3WF][img]https://i.ibb.co/rbt7mtR/IMG-0005.jpg[/img][/url]\n<b>\n[url=https://ibb.co/w71mQVG][img]https://i.ibb.co/m07WykZ/IMG-0007.jpg[/img][/url]\n<b>\n[url=https://ibb.co/72SPPZ9][img]https://i.ibb.co/jg8mmQp/IMG-0009.jpg[/img][/url]\n<b>\n[url=https://ibb.co/DWJhdvK][img]https://i.ibb.co/F3r2py7/IMG-0010.jpg[/img][/url]",
