      "post_content": "Picked these up recently, and would love for them to go to postcard/Tiger collector. If anyone knows anything about them - please chime in. I am no where near an expert on postcards. \n\nThey were never mailed, but the owner wrote player names on the back as well as some other notations (years played, position, etc).\n\nIncludes T206 subjects like Donovan, Crawford, Schmidt, Mullin, mcguire, and carr\n\nPrice is $375 or best offer for the lot. Dont hesitate to send offers, i dont know if thats a good price or embarrassingly exorbitant. PayPal FF is preferred.\n\n\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/0af22068f64b5d14403d7f2ed3a17569.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/091bc24e528b9c1fad5bef6966a629af.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/a79706abdd37842a8dd6118e9bb1a04e.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/21e1a1b245970e2cfbfeed8490bbd3ea.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/484a14b1024c4e74c1e3071727fddc71.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/2f5a0cd999cfae363bfddab05a603f6e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/55f5149ccfdda66197d4eeed86c66b22.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/6e77568f516104dc6b94945fffbf170f.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/91f5e1490a8a80bb395e86dcb5687514.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20230301/8edbe60f20e18d4a80b13937e256eef2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

If so, they were very well done.\n\nI'm soooo tempted.....",

      "post_content": "Images originated from 1903-04 as Ed Barrow pictured was their field manager for only those two seasons. Also, includes Crawford which makes sense but a couple of years before Cobb joined the Tigers, thus why he is not included. I agree, 60\u2019s-70\u2019s as date of production looks right. \n\nJust noticed the hand written years on the back, consensus looks to be 1903 is the winner.",
