      "post_content": "FS: 1899 cabinet photo of Tom O'Brien. O'Brien played for the Baltimore Orioles, Pittsburgh Pirates, and the New York Giants---and is known for his early death in 1900 due to complications after drinking seawater as a cure for seasickness. \n\nThe cabinet is an O'Brien rarity. Taken in 1899 in Roanoke, VA, while at spring training with the Pirates. I know of only one other example, sold by Heritage in 2017, with the same example subsequently selling on Ebay.\n\nLandes/Roanoke/VA imprint at lower right corner.\n\nCondition is good. Some light toning. Small nail hole at bottom left. Small strip of light paper loss on reverse. See scans. \n\nOverall size is 4.75\" x 6\".\n\nPrice: $SOLD shipped. Check or Paypal G/S\n\nPM with interest.\n\nThx,\nRay\n\nClick through for larger scans:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/yd11xy3][img]https://i.ibb.co/LYWWstG/1899-OBrien-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=https://ibb.co/q5FNz58][img]https://i.ibb.co/ySB6DSC/1899-OBrien-rev-s.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/N77YtQn][img]https://i.ibb.co/nRRk6Z8/1899-OBrien-Landes.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nFrom SABR O'Brien bio:\n\n[url=https://ibb.co/p2k4TS7][img]https://i.ibb.co/9ndy07D/1899-OBrien-Roanoke.png[/img][/url]",
