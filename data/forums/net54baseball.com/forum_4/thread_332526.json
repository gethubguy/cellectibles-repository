      "post_content": "Unusual postcard of a man at his desk reading The Sun newspaper sporting section with a large headlines of White Sox Win Game along with a team photo.\nPostmarked from San Diego on April 9, 1908.\n\nThough there is no doubt of when the postcard was mailed, the image could be from the 1906 World Series since the White Sox win is so prominent.  Additionally the White Sox first official game in 1908 was April 14th which is  after the postcard was mailed.\n\nPrice $75 Shipped\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/Cd526cdr][img]https://i.postimg.cc/RCLzh8mm/20230305-131724.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/F166t0Lr][img]https://i.postimg.cc/xTjVzRjz/20230305-131738.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/N2KP9jWv][img]https://i.postimg.cc/nr28Ws2r/20230305-131841.jpg[/img][/url]",
