      "post_content": "Picked up a very unique Cobb M101-3 PC a couple years ago raw at The National. Showed it to numerous collectors and auction houses. No one I spoke to including Bill Mastro has ever seen a Sporting News M101-3 with an advertisement on the verso. Last M101-3 Cobb sold at Heritage for $40k+. Recently graded by SGC 1.5 because it has been postally used. Otherwise looks like a solid 3.5. No creases!  Looking for an offer. \nIf interested in pics, please email me...\n[url]Dan@chiprop.com[/url]",
