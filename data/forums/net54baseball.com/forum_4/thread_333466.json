I went on SGC website, and these were the results.   There's been no sales on these cards since 2013 & 2017 in a PSA holder. \n\nHamilton POP 9 and only 1 with the card I have for sale. Hamilton has 6 variations.\n\n\nMcCarthy POP 20 and only 3 W/ St.Louis that I have for sale.   McCarthy has 9 variations.",
