I presume this was part of a team issue but I would like to know if there is a designation number for this postcard. \n\nWould also be curious to know an estimate of value for this item. Thanks in advance for any help.",

At the time I was considering sending this in, PSA was somewhere in their several million card slabbing backlog period, and I could get quicker turn around if I sent in going the sticker route, so that's what I did. I would prefer it in a slab. \n\nIt is for sale, so if anyone is interested, message me. I will post in the BST section.",
