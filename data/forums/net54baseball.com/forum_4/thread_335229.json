      "post_content": "I\u2019m looking for postcards, photos, etc\u2026 of Babe Towne. He\u2019s the only major leaguer from my hometown. He spent most of his career in the minor leagues throughout Iowa and Nebraska, but played a few games for the 1906 Chicago White Sox. I currently have this postcard, but would be interested in anything else that\u2019s out there. Not sure exactly what exists. These were all the teams he played for:\n\n1902 Rock Rapids Browns\n1903 Des Moines Undertakers\n1904 Des Moines Prohibitionists\n1905 Des Moines Underwriters\n1905 Milwaukee Brewers\n1906 Des Moines Champs\n1906 Chicago White Sox\n1907 Minneapolis Millers\n1907 Burlington Pathfinders\n1909 Sioux City Packers\n1910 Sioux City Packers\n1911 Sioux City Packers\n1912 Sioux City Packers\n1914 Norfolk Drummers\n1916 Fort Dodge Dodgers",
