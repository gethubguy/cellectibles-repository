      "post_content": "Old Judge Connor-has to be trimmed. Between 1 1/4 and 1 1/2, but not the latter by 2 1/2 and it measures short top to bottom as well when compared to other Old Judges. No bottom left corner and paper loss next to that lost corner. Paper loss top left and top right corners. Also, corner wear as well bottom right. Crease top left corner. Paper loss to right of inner shoulder between shoulder and bat. Crease from upper left border parallel to mid-upper arm through the mid-upper arm on the left through the body with paper loss to the right of the body. Another crease has two parts with the first one coming from mid-left border through just above the belt into the elbow. Another crease from the left border parallel breaks away from the first in the background just to the left of the belt and goes diagonally across the upper legs to the right border. There is obvious staining on the back, but apparently the card is not skinned. Overlook all these factors, get bombed on your favorite alcohol and a couple other things that can take you to an interesting hallucinogenic level and the card may come out at that point to be high grade. :D Sold\n\nS/h is $5.00 unless you live in California, Oregon or the state of Washington in which cases s/h is $5.50.
