It's also a great read on it's own for both the cards and the players.\n\n...and it's an interesting coffee table book that many visitors have thumbed through and found interesting, even people who have no idea about baseball cards (which is most people who find themselves in my living room).\n\nMy personal want-list for A/G is 15-16 cards and I'm 2/3rd the way there.  Because of that, it's value as a reference for me is minimal, but I can't imagine getting rid of it because of it's all-around information value.",
