      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\nConsidering selling one of my \"really good\" postcards! Available for sale is my 1907 Heimer Detroit Tigers Team Postcard graded SGC 30. Includes Ty Cobb of course! Much tougher to find compared to the HM Taylor postcard with the same photo. One recent sale I found was in 2021 of a PSA 3.5 that sold for $2,640 at Heritage Auctions.\n\nBack is clean on this one, with no writing or damage. Surprised it's not graded higher! Price is SOLD including shipping. PM or post if interested and thanks for looking!\n\n\nJeff",
