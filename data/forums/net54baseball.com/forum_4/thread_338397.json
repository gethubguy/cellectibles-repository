I attended the National Pastime 11th Long Island Classic at Hofstra University in 1994 and it was posted that DiMaggio would not sign Perez-Steele cards as well as a laundry list of other items (ex. pictures with Marilyn Monroe). Purportedly, DiMaggio claimed that some entity (Perez-Steele??) owed him $10K. The Perez-Steele cards print run was 10,000. Perhaps, collectors are just keeping the cards in the boxed sets.\n\nI have 49 of the cards signed, holding out for a public signing with Brett (eventually) and Koufax (unlikely). Initially, I did not like the post cards. I started with one (Maz) for a potential project and I was hooked and started kicking myself for not getting in sooner. From initially passing on the cards, I missed the opportunity of getting quite a few players.  I had a tough time trying to find an unsigned Feller!  Feller may have signed all 10,000 cards. Feller was everywhere. When Palmer signed his card he said \"Ah Perez-Steele, I think I have signed all 10,000 of these.\" Palmer is the new Feller. There used to be a dealer (Jeff Richmond) who set up regularly at Chantilly and sold Perez-Steele and GLAC. I believe Jeff is deceased.",
