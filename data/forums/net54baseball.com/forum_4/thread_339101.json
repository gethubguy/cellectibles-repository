      "post_content": "Up for sale is this 1911 RPPC of Rube Foster's American Giants.  It features Hall of Famer Pete Hill as well as should be Hall of Famer Bruce Petway along with their teammates. Dated on the front and postmarked several days later, IMO the best authentication possible.  SOLD.  I would also consider trades for Deadball Era photographs.\n\nFor more information see this link:\n\n[url]https://chapmandeadballcollection.com/portfolio/1911-american-giants-postcard/[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=584252&d=1691872069[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=584251&d=1691872029[/IMG]",
