Please see the scans for condition but know that most have some back damage or other issues.  I am looking for 1100.00 delivered for the group.  There are actually 48 total cards in the lot but 11 are non baseball (included because the 12th is baseball and the set is best kept together).  Please let me know if you are interested, want better scans, or if you have any questions about the condition.  \n\nAlan",
