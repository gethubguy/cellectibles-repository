Now it is time for it to move on to someone else. \n\nTim used to live in a PSA 2 plastic house but was freed from it long ago. He is still looking quite well after all these years and has a great image for a 19th century Allen & Ginter card.\n\nSee images below to help you form an opinion on condition. PM or post in thread with any questions or requests.\n\nPrice is $OLD\n\nPayPal FF preferred. If PayPal G&S add $10. Shipping and insurance is included.",
