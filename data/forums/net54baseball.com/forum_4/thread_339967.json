      "post_content": "Very nice looking card for a \"1\".  There's some corner and mild edge chipping but nothing that really deserves a grading this low.  No creasing or damage done and the back is mostly clean and entirely damage free!\n\nNeat to offer up a card of a Kansas City player as you don't see too many KC Old Judges appear for sale too often.\n\nAsking $210 delivered.  Thanks in advance!\n\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=587419&d=1693781581[/IMG]",
