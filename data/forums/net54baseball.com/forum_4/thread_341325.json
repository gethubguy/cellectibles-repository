      "post_content": "hi all,\n\nI have two extra White Sox in this set to sell or swap, which are way more difficult than the Cubs.  For some perspective, there are currently 72 Cubs graded by SGC/PSA - an average of about 6 for each player in the set.  But there are only about 2 each graded of the White Sox players (21 total). \n\nMine are \nEddie Hahn SGC2    $350\nFrank Isbell SGC1.5  $300\n\n\nI know it's a longshot, but I'm looking for the Cubs Team card, Sheckard, Comiskey, Davis, Dougherty  \n\nI'll gladly swap for or buy any of those.   \n\nTim",
