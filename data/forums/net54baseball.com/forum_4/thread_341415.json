I had this card once in g or vg (CRS?) but the registration was quite a bit off and it bothered me to look at it. Sold it for around 2100. and haven't been able to replace it since then. All the while the asking prices continue to escalate. Would like to finish the set before the world ends. Just looking with condition/aesthetics in mind and willing to pay up for it.",
