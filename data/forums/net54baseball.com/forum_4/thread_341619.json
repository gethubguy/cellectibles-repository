      "post_content": "This November I am wanting to buy a selection of 19th Century HOFers and right now I am trying to get a sense of what might be available so I can prioritize, as I will not have the funds to purchase everything I want! Below is what I am looking for - my budget will require lower grades, in the 1-2 range. If you have anything you'd be open to selling in November, please send me a DM. Thank you!\n\nChris\n\n\nN28 John Montgomery Ward\nN28 Tim Keefe\nN28 John Clarkson\nN29 Buck Ewing \nN162 Goodwin Dan Brouthers\nN172 Old Hoss Radbourn\nN172 Pud Galvin \nN300 Billy Hamilton\nN300 Amos Rusie",
