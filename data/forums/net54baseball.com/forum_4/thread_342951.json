      "post_content": "For Sale: Two very rare OJs, Jim Banning who is on the top 100 scarce cards in the Goodwin book (8 graded copies) and Cliff Carroll (12 graded copies). Both played for Washington but Carroll had a very solid 11 year Major League career whereas Banning had a 5 year career in Minors but only 3 at bats in Majors (many of scarce cards in the Goodwin book are for players with very short major league resumes). The Banning card is pricier owing to its rarity and solid condition whereas Carroll has paper loss in top corner and crease.  Shipping with tracking and bubble wrap envelope ad $5\n\nBanning $old\nCarroll $old",
