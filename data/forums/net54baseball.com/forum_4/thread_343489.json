      "post_content": "Apparently low grade raw commons with writing on them are worth $2500 apiece as revealed just hours ago in REA. Here's nearly two full sets of high grade Brush PCs, with both Jennings cards. Feel free to make me an offer on any of the cards, keeping in mind the super awesome prices from last night. I'm sure the underbidder will be on this quickly, so PM me today if you want your shot! :)\n\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/calvindog/albums/72157633532602923/[/url]",
