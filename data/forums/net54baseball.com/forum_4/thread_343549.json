The slab also has a few scratches, surface itself is free of creases/wrinkles. \nI still think it's a great card and I'm open to trades. PM with any interest\n\n\n[IMG]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1101648862575333397/1181731054042763304/IMG_4508.jpg?ex=65821fce&is=656faace&hm=5d1b958efacb3f4bd3eb8e4b301dfb0b7d2e399c90c684e687d15234f6f886b5&=&format=webp&width=436&height=581[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1101648862575333397/1181731053099040958/IMG_4514.jpg?ex=65821fce&is=656faace&hm=109035a16dd9669b563084cb893a0b6f7fe96fc589c45febe8953b2b5f3de655&=&format=webp&width=436&height=581[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1101648862575333397/1181731053539438692/IMG_4512.jpg?ex=65821fce&is=656faace&hm=f9bc7164bde857b29872020746633c11ffd593d2f6b7f2c5d92c0b1d253db21a&=&format=webp&width=436&height=581[/IMG]",
