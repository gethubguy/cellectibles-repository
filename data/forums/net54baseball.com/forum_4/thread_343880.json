Have all the Harpers weekly and Leslie Weekly with the baseball woodcuts, many duplicates. Full newspapers in almost every case, a few prints. I am thinking I will be selling those. As an aside I understand that is not what you are looking at, but I am taking advantage of my response to let others know.    Ha!!!\n\nThanks",
