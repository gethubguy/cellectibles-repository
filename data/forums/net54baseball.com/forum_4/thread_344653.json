I\u2019d be most interested in an N300 Mayo or N162. An N172 OJ is definitely out of the budget at the moment. I also have some T206 offbacks if open to partial trades.",

Firstly, post-pandemic prices have become so inflated.  Secondly, it's a relatively rare card to come up at auction at all.  Thirdly, I honestly have not seen one in such raggedy condition, at least for years (if ever).\n\nHonestly, I'd be thrilled to get 5K for it.",
