I had the discussion with SGC 15 years ago when I had it graded that it looked like a botched factory cut but they still wouldn\u2019t give it a number.  The image is superb and the reverse printing is flawless.  $1125 net to me.  PayPal or check.  First PM that says \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d gets the card.",
