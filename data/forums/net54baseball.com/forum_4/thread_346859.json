      "post_content": "Offered here is a N184 W.S. Kimball & Co. Burch Baseball Fielder. It is crease free and has excellent color, registration and centering. It also has square nice corners. It was graded a 2 by PSA due to some discoloration on the back. I am not sure what the discoloration is from as I bought it raw and didn't think the back was too bothersome. There is no paper loss just some toning you can see in the scan that also came from PSA. This was a purchase I made and thought I may want to hold it but in the end I would like to sell it. Since I dont know the value I will leave it as a make me an offer sort of listing (which I have never tried before on the board). It is a great card and someone will really enjoy it",
