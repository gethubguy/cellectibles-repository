      "post_content": "Hello -\nI'm sorry to bother you on your post, but I don't know how to start a thread of my own (I'm brand-new!)\nI have an 8 1/2 x 10 black-and-white photograph of Rogers Hornsby, giving a lecture on hitting to the 1962 Santa Barbara Rancheros (Mets farm team) at Laguna Park in Santa Barbara.  It is signed and dated, but the edges are a bit frayed.  It shows the team sitting on the outfield grass listening to Hornsby, and my father, Gene Lillard, the manager, standing and myself (then about to start my senior year in high school where I earned All-CIF honors, First Team, with a BA of  .423 for the season and .522 in league) kneeling at the right side of the photo.\nI was just curious if you thought anyone might be interested in this photo.\nThanks for any help or advice you might be able to give.\nSincerely,\nTim Lillard",
