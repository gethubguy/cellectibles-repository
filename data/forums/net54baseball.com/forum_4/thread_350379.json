      "post_content": "Original and rare postcard that I acquired out of a collection where it has been for at least the past 20 years. 1914 real photo postcard from the barnstorming world tour of New York Giants & Chicago White Sox teams that also featured other baseball stars. Postcard shows the teams in street clothes at the Vatican in Rome.\n\nForeign issued postcard per the credit and markings on the back. The original owner 100 years ago notated in ink some numbers on the front of the card that correspond to his attempt to identify some of the individauls by writing their names on the back (although he mispelled McGraw's name). It also appers the last few names on the back of the card he did not put numbers on the front.\n\nA few years ago there was a lengthy discussion and effort on this board to identify all the individuals on the card. See that discussion here: [url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showth...hlight=vatican[/url]\nPostcard is in very nice ex/mt condition except for the ink notations on the front and back. 100% original. I have only seen offered for sale a few times over the past 25 years. See scans below.\n\nPrice $1,000 shipped.\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/4mhNCGXT][img]https://i.postimg.cc/9FL47XSz/01.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/5jrNkyd3][img]https://i.postimg.cc/02kMjKVL/20230402-163503.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/LJK42Wsg][img]https://i.postimg.cc/kgD2F33s/20230402-163515.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/LJt9XVqC][img]https://i.postimg.cc/VkTdKGz8/20230402-163559.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/5HfxFFLx][img]https://i.postimg.cc/mrHhJYrF/20230402-163611.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/tZTpBQBw][img]https://i.postimg.cc/gJyjkG8z/20230402-163621.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/d7nJRtjG][img]https://i.postimg.cc/d1cDYh7N/20230402-163904.jpg[/img][/url]",
