      "post_title": "FS 1910 CA Hayward Cubs postcard SOLD",
      "post_author_name": "bocca001",
      "post_content": "For sale is what I believe to be a circa 1910 postcard of two players from the Hayward Cubs, which was a short lived California minor league team. It could be from a different \"Hayward\" team, but the toploader it came with has a note written on it identifying it as Hayward, California. The image on the postcard (i.e., players' faces) is more clear than shown in my pictures. Something about the background is making it difficult to get a clear picture. \n\nPrice is $50 shipped, Paypal FFM. Or best offer.\n\nSOLD",
