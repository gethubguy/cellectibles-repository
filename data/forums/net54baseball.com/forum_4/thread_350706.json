      "post_content": "I'm looking to upgrade my N284 Buchner Gold Coin Tobacco card of Sam Crane, Short Stop, Washington card. I prefer a VGish card with nice eye appeal. The example I currently have is pictured below (please ignore the pics of the Hines card). As you can see, my Crane card was apparently cut from an advertising poster and then glued or pasted onto a thin piece of cardboard.",
