      "post_content": "Hi everyone,  I am looking for a low grade M101-3 Ty Cobb postcard, preferably a 1 or a 2.  Does not matter if it has been mailed.  I'm willing to by outright or trade; I have added a picture of my Cobb/Ruth/Gehrig collection and would be willing to part with some to facilitate a deal.  Also interested in other Cobb postcards such as Dietsch Fielding, Topping, or Max Stein. I will be at the National Saturday and Sunday.  Let me know, what is available, thanks!",
