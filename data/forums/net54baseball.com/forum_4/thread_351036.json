SGC will grade the individual pieces as authentic as you see.\n\nBacks are blank and free from writing, etc.  Wilson's back has part of the postcard design (stamp area, etc.)\n\n\nSGC AU   $60 each\nAbstein \nAdams \nCamnitz\n\nRAW\nMaddox/Leach (player on each side) - $60\nAbbaticchio $45\nLiefield $45\nWilson (rough edge) $40  \n\nI'll make a good deal if you want the whole group!",
