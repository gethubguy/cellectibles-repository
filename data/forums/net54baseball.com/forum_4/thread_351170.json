      "post_content": "A slice of baseball history here - mailed from Chicago on October 5, 1906 - when the Cubs dynasty was at its peak just before running into the Hitless Wonder World Series buzzsaw.  Unfortunately someone has sliced the card a bit on two sides as you can see from the back - but it's still a great piece, and not one of the ones you usually see from this season.  \n\nStaying with me for the moment\u2026",
