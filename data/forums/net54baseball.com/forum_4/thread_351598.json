      "post_content": "Hi - breaking up my SGC-graded 1884 Lawson's Patent Baseball Game set.  There are 36 total cards here.  Back when SGC had a set registry, this was the #1 set on it.  \n\nThese cards are 140 years old!  Hard to believe they are still so affordable for such high grades from this era.\n\nAlso would consider offers for the full set (which has an average grade of 8.67).\n\nCards and grades are as seen below.  I can provide better pics of anything you want to see better. Postage included if it's over $100, or else add $4.  Prices by grade are:\n\nSGC 88:  $60\nSGC 92:  $80\nSGC 96:  $105\n\n3 Strikes SGC 88\n3 Strikes Missed SGC 88\n3 Strikes Out SGC 88\n7 Balls SGC 88  SOLD\nBase Hit 1 SGC 80  SOLD\nBase Hit 2 SGC 88\nBase Hit 3 SGC 88\nBaseman 1 SGC 96\nBaseman 2 SGC 96  SOLD\nBaseman 3 SGC 96\nCatcher SGC 96\nFly Ball SGC 96\nFly Catch SGC 96\nFly Muff SGC 96\nForced Out SGC 92\nFoul Ball SGC 92\nFoul Catch SGC 96\nFoul Muff SGC 96\nGrounder SGC 88\nHome Run SGC 96\nPickup SGC 96\nStriker SGC 96 - all 9 copies are SOLD\nUmpire SGC 96\nValue of Cards Rules Card SGC 88\nWild Throw SGC 96 (There are 5 exact copies of the Wild Throw card, all graded SGC 96, as the original game came with 5 exact copies of the card.  The PSA Set Registry only lists one copy of the card in its set registry.)  1 SOLD, 4 remain\n\nThanks for looking!\nScott",
