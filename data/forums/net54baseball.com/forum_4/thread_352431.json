      "post_content": "I am reorganizing my hobby library and making some of my duplicate publications available.\n\n138 page book from 1983 by Lew Lipset. The back cover has a corner crease, but is in otherwise excellent condition. Binding is tight and there is no writing or highlighting.  \n\nThis is an essential book for any vintage collector's library that covers virtually all of the 19th century baseball card issues in depth.\n\n$SOLD delivered in the US via USPS Media Mail. \n\nPayPal FF, Venmo FF or a check is fine.",
