Dietsche Publisher distributed postcards like this for the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs.  Multiple iterations of Ty Cobb in the set.  Edward Siever had a decent career himself, posting a league-leading 1.91 ERA in 1902.  Plenty of corner wear to this one, but otherwise really clean.\n\nWould be curious if anyone knows how these photographs were taken.  Doesn't look quite natural to me, but does appear to be a photograph.\n\nAsking $60 delivered, PayPal F&F.  Let me know if interested, and thanks for looking!\n\nBrad",
