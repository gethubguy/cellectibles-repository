This is the scarcest image of Rusie and is one of only 2 or 3 known graded copies of this pose, who is one of the toughest HOFers to find in general. Fun fact about Rusie that many on here already likely know, in the twilight of his career, he was traded for a young pitcher... named Christy Mathewson.\n\nAsking $2,000 due to the image scarcity, but open to offers/discussion if anyone is interested. Price is net to me and includes shipping. Thanks for looking, feel free to message with any questions!",
