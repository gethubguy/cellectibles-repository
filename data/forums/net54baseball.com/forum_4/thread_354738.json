      "post_content": "Beautiful and very scarce (granted, most of these are) Old Judge. High end card with a small ink mark on back and tiny dent just above lower left corner (near his outstretched hand). \n\nSGC pop 1 (total SGC pop 4), none higher. \nPSA total pop 2, 1 is higher (an 8 but an old grade and comparing the two you couldn't tell any difference)  \nSOLD THANK YOU including express delivery or 3% discount for Zelle/FF/check. \n\nNew seller to here - member for past 18 months - and have purchased items from a few of you before. Just selling off a part of my collection as I have a slightly different focus now (changes often). eBay user ID is megalodonteeth so you can see feedback. Thanks for looking - Steve",

I love these \"staged action\" shots they came up with for these cards. Then having an image with this clarity is icing on the top. I didn't even know I wanted it until I saw it - then I had to have it :)",
