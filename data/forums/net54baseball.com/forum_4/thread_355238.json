      "post_content": "Jeff: Thanks for the Yencer Weidensaul postcard. Got here a couple of days ago. Who, you might ask, the heck was Yencer Weidensaul? He had a middling minor league career of about a decade's duration; he looks more like a bookkeeper than a rugged deadballer. Yencer (or Yancer or Yenser or Yentzer or Genser or whatever else) was a college teammate of Christy Mathewson. According to the appended death notice he was also Matty's cousin. I have a 1902 Bucknell yearbook and his name kept popping up: captain of the baseball team, business manager of the school paper, Sigma Chi frat boy. In my fantasy world where I've cobbled together cardboard and memories of a visit to Lewisburg following a National in Baltimore some years back this postcard fits in perfectly.\n\n1907 Toronto Maple Leafs\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/sportscardsetc/mischidden/christymathewsonbucknell/large/1907%20Yenser%20Weidensaul%20RPPC.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/sportscardsetc/mischidden/christymathewsonbucknell/huge/Baseball%201.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf I'm not mistaken YW is front-row, second from left\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/sportscardsetc/mischidden/christymathewsonbucknell/large/Baseball%202.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMatty's \"view\" from his gravesite\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/sportscardsetc/mischidden/miscellanybaseball/large/DSC04661.JPG[/IMG]\n\nA notice of YW's death in a Bucknell newsletter in 1950\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/kawika_o_ka_pakipika/sportscardsetc/mischidden/christymathewsonbucknell/websize/June%201951%20Bucknell%20Alumnus%20newsletter.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBonus scan. You could win a bar bet asking what was Matty's major in college.
