      "post_content": "\"Zero\" series n172 Dorgan in an SGC AUT holder.  The card has a neat printing/production error, where the albumen photo when being attached to the stock got folded in the upper left corner, creating uneven borders and a slight shortening of Dorgan's extended arm. \n\nAny sort of a printing goof out of any 19th century set is insanely scarce....I've seen so few from any of the \"N\" issues at all.  \n\nAsking $265 \n\nThanks all!\nBrian\n[url]redmaccie@hotmail.com[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=640951&d=1731867969[/IMG]",
