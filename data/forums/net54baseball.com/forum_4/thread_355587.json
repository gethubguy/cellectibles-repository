      "post_content": "Up for sale is an interesting RPPC of Tony Faeth, early in his baseball playing career.  He is pictured in his semi-pro team uniform (Fairmont) c1911.  The back of the postcard has several publication markings.  Included will be a return letter/envelope from the publication back to Tony from 1941.\n\nTake a look at Tony's SABR bio here:\n[url]https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/tony-faeth/[/url]\n\nFrom what I can see, he was an interesting character, particularly off the baseball field, having bested Dave \"Beauty\" Bancroft in a billiards match and boxing other major leaguers.  While with the St. Paul Saints, he was  instrumental in winning the pennant in the 1924 American Association, finishing with a 15-4 record, and was a key contributor in the championship games against the Baltimore Orioles in the Little World Series.  He even squared off against Lefty Grove during the Little World Series.\n\nFaeth did get a small taste of the big leagues in 1919 and 1920, pitching for the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAsking [S]$95[/S] $75 net to me.  Shipping is on me.  PM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/c1911%20Faeth%20RPPC.jpg[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/c1911%20Faeth%20RPPC%20_back_.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/c1911%20Faeth%20RPPC%20_Photo%20Envelope_.jpg[/IMG]",
