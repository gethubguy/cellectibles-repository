      "post_content": "Exceedingly rare, one of only four baseball related real photo postcards taken by renowned NYC photographer Thaddeus Wilkerson.  \n\nThe postcard is postally used, but the obverse is in great condition.  Using a loupe, you can see details of the spectators in the crowd.\n\nThe price is $2600 delivered in the conus with signature tracking.  Payment is via PayPal \"friends and family,\" personal check, or money order.  I've been on net54 for 15 years and can provide a mountain of references.\n\nCommitment to purchases outweighs any other inquiries.\n\nPlease send a PM if interested. Thank you.\n\n[url]https://www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/postcards/88498/tw[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/postcards/88499/tw[/IMG]",
