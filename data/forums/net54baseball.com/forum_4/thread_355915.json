      "post_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nLooking to sell or trade my 1888 N174 OJ John L. Sullivan PSA 6 (MK). Of the three graded, this is the highest on the PSA Pop chart. Front is beautiful, with strong contrast, especially for a 136-year old card. Mark is on the back as seen in pic. Yours for $2250. In a trade, I'd love to get a similarly priced OJ Spotted Tie with good contrast on the front.\n\nPlease PM if interested. Thanks for looking.",
