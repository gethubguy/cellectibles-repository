Was wondering if you can help me out.  I bought an N43 and it is shiny on the front.  Was hoping you could tell me what to look for for authenticity. \n\nThanks\n\nGeoff",

I will be listing them on eBay in the near future if I can get off the couch.\n\nI have a very nice set missing one card (much nicer than the one currently listed on the bay and all graded - with 24 cards that range from 60 to 80). I'll suppose I would sell for a silly strong offer.",
