      "post_content": "Early 1900s postcard of Ned Hanlon, Durnan, Scholes and Longboat of Toronto, Canada. Corner wear, but the biggest flaw is a break in the paper from the bottom through the glove wrist of the driver. This flaw is also evident on the back of the postcard. The postcard measures 5 1/4 by 3 1/2. Retracted. Found this was a Ned Hanlan and not Ned Hanlon. Following up with another board member from whom I bought this postcard.\n\nBecause of size, the s/h is $7.00.\n\nIf paying by PayPal, please pay by PayPal Gift/Friends and Family to [url]wizard15243@yahoo.com[/url].",
