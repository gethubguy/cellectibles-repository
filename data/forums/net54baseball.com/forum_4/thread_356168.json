      "post_content": "1907-1909 H M Taylor postcard of Donovan, Jennings and Chance-a couple creases which are shown in separate pictures. Also, corner wear. PLEASE NOTE: I have put the bottom left corner cover back in its original flat surface appearance. The strange thing that happened AFTER the surface white tip of the corner (not the whole corner) came off in the tip of my right index finger, it stayed in the lower left front when I put it there. No, I did not use anything to help it stay. Just complete honesty here with both the original picture and the latter picture as well as pictures of the creases. $225.00.\n \nS/h is $7.00.",
