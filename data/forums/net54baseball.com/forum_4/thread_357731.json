      "post_content": "John Ward is one of the more interesting of the 19th Century players.  He is a HOF member, and excelled as a pitcher before blowing out his arm and becoming an everyday player.  He was briefly married to famous stage actress Helen Dauvray (who presented the first WS trophy \"The Dauvray Cup\" which has been lost to history).  Ward was also an attorney and an early organizer of a players union opposed to the reserve clause.  He was the instigator and leader of the Players League rebellion in 1890.\n\nYour card is pose #3 of 9 poses in the N172 set.  The card is from 1889.\n\nHere is my complete pose run for Ward, featuring cards from all 3 years (1887, 1888 & 1889).  There are no known 1890 cards of him during the Players League days (nor any for his team, Ward's Wonders, who became the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in the NL)\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=649837&d=1738594655[/IMG]",
