Will cut a significant deal if you take both.\n\nPSA 4: $SOLD\nPSA 4.5: $4,150\n\nThis is the only photo I have on my computer at the moment, but I am happy to provide additional photos upon request.\n\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=651958&d=1740071282[/IMG]\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel",
