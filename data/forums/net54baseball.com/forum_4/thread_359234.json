Hines was hearing impaired, like my son, and we live in Indy, so we have chosen this to pursue together.\n\nIf you have any of the Indianapolis version, even if you\u2019re not interested in selling currently, would you please share what you have?  Feel free to PM if you prefer not to make it public.\n\nThanks!",
