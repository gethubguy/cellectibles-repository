      "post_content": "For Sale...\n\nThis is a beautiful oversized 1884 John H. Ryder cabinet of Cleveland Blues rookie, George Pinkney. The most notable flaws are staining and chipping on the back from album removal, and an approximately 3/4\" wrinkle on the bottom boarder. One photo shows a standard size N173 proof cabinet in front of the Pinkney cabinet as a size comparison. You don't see many of this size.\n\nPrice: ***(SOLD)***\n\nPayment Accepted: PayPal or Venmo. FF payment preferred but G&S is fine as well.\n\nI can post any other photos needed upon request.\nThanks for looking.",
