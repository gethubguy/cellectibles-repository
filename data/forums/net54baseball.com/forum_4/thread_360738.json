      "post_content": "Up for sale is an absolutely gorgeous Old Judge \"rookie\" of Big Ed Delahanty.  This is one of the toughest cards to find of this great HOFer and has fantastic clarity and contrast.  The technical grade is accurate due to some minor paper loss on the front, which doesn't detract from the image much at all.\n\nThis one is a tough pill to swallow because the last time I sold a Delahanty on Net54, I sold it for $6,500 and it sold at auction a year later for over $50k.  But I could use the funds to pay for a recent REA purchase. \n\n$X,XXX net to me.  My loss is your gain.\n\nPM or email me at [url]h2oya311@yahoo.com[/url] if interested.\n\n[IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1889%20Delahanty.PNG[/IMG][IMG]https://photos.imageevent.com/derekgranger/derekgrangerfirstalbum/websize/1889%20Delahanty%20_back_.PNG[/IMG]",
