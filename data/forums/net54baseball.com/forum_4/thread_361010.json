I\u2019m looking for an IN PERSON CASH transaction in the Northeast. I would consider breaking into two lots, Goodwin and A&G, but not interested in breaking into individual cards. Just seeing if the funds are there for this purchase I have in mind. If not, I\u2019ll survive, so not willing to haggle. Have fun finding these cards offered as a set. \nMost are low grade, a few are raw. Several \u201cAuthentic\u201d holders, some have back damage. Key cards are decent, although N162 Anson has significant back damage. Additional pics by request. Here are a few key cards. PLEASE only inquire if you are serious. This will only be available for a few days, then the window closes.\nPlenty of references here. Thanks!\n\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20250511/e4f6f58e06cd31f4bce19f45dc5c8683.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20250511/0f8fb57bc03e9dd8d2bbe02c6b768003.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
