      "post_content": "I've had these awhile and never made much headway on identifying them - \n\nThe light-colored jersey seems to say \"Winchester\" and the other two have a \"W, \" although in a different font.  The only Winchester team in BB Ref was in Kentucky and existed from 1908-1924 in the Blue Grass League.  T210 Series 6 Old Mill features this league and team.  These guys could be part of the set - \n\nHere's a previous thread:\n[url]https://www.net54baseball.com/showthread.php?t=283721[/url]\n\nI'm happy to let these go to a collector of T210s or other related material. Let me know if you're interested, or make an offer - \n\nTim",
