Calloway led the funeral procession for Berry in 1940. Since then, the graves of both Glasscock and Berry were dug up and relocated to the exit 5 cemetery because of surrounding construction to the Wheeling cemetery in the latter 1960s. Also, buried at the cemetery is an actor from \"Patton\" whose parents were quite wealthy.",
