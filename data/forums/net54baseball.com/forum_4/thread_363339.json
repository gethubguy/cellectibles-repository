      "post_content": "FS 1905 Philadelphia A's postcard postmarked October 10 1905 the day They played Game 2 of the World series vs the Giants. Postmarked in Phila the writer of the postcard mentions the series. \n1905 saw The A's and the Giants compete in only the 2nd World Series. And souvenirs that can be dated to the series are extremely scarce. Hope this finds a Good Home Asking $650 more on Ebay. \n\nThanks for looking",
