I am not concerned with what team the player is on and I am primarily concerned with the condition and resolution of the front photo.\n I guess that makes me \"old school\" with the Old Judges:\n1.  Deacon White\n2.  Pete Browning\n3.  Bob Caruthers\n4.  Tip O'Neill\nI would also like to get Comiskey or Tim Keefe that are more professionally gradeable Vg or better.\n\n-----\nI don't have any 19th Century to sell right now although I would trade some of what I have for the players listed above.",
