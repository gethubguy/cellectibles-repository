I am looking to buy or trade (several nice and rare cards available, including a N172 Connie Mack, an E135 Hornsby rookie, and a W600 Mordecai Brown). If you have one available, please email me. To view my cards, feel free to email me or check my website:\n\n[url]http://www.imageevent.com/crb972[/url]\n\nThanks,\n\nChris",
