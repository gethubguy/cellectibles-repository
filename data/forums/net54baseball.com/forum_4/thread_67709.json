He played for Holy Cross university from 1895-96 and the Cleveland Indians from 1897-99, then for Lowell Massachussetts in 1902.  \n\nAlso looking for any and all Roy Castleton items, played in the PCL from 1909-1913 and also played for Youngstown Ohio before that.  Has Zeenut/Obak etc cards.  I also need a signature as well (only died in 1967 but cant find an autograph).\n\nRhys Yeakley",

Actually, now that I think of it, I could just scan it and sent it on.  It's in my file cabinet at work, so I'll get it tomorrow.  Also, I assume you know there is a book.\nMark",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Dan Bretta\nRhys, If you're interested in American Indians who have played in the Majors there is a really good book that came out within the last two months by Jeffrey Powers-Beck titled \"The American Indian Integration of Baseball\".  It contains a lot of information on Sockalexis.  I recently purchased it for its content on the Nebraska Indians Baseball Club.\n\n[url]http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0803237456/ref=olp_product_details/102-7203759-6848157?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance[/url]",
