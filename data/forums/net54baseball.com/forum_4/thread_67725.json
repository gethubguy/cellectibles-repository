Currently, I'm actively collecting N2, N28, N29, N184, N310, T3, T9, T200 T222, have a decent sized pre 1925 baseball type card collection, tobacco banners, store counter cards, premiums, have 59 or so different tobacco albums.\n\nIn my collecting past I've completed 2 T205 sets and was up to 470 or so different T206s. I also had and completed many sets of non baseball tobacco (the Duke Poor Boys and Civil War General booklets were 2 of my favorites thinking back) They're all long since gone [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/sad.gif[/IMG]. I used to spend a lot of time in flea markets when I was in my mid to late teens (Lancaster County PA was and still is a hot spot for these). Anyway, back in the late 60s or early 70s I bought those other 2 T206 Cobbs I needed at a local flea market on the same day for a grand total of $20 [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG], even then I was happy to get them at that price! I used to pass up all kinds of N172s for peanuts back then because I thought they lacked color and were boring to look at...sortta reminded me of the actor and actress cards I also used to pick up for even less peanuts at the time. Geesh.\n\nI almost ALWAYS have something available for trade if you have something I collect.",
