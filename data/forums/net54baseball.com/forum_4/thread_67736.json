I am doing research on the Chicago Maroons and need any material related to them, e.g., OJs, schedules, programs, tickets, oddball cards, etc. If one of you won lot #40 in the recently completed Lipset Auction, and are interested in selling the Herman Long and Dunn cards, I'm eager to buy. Please contact me at my e-mail: mpeich@comcast.net.\n\n                   Many thanks, Mike",
