No bat in image.  Not exactly sure what game of \"ball\" this is but interesting none-the-less. 3 1/2\" x 4\". SOLD[/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://home.kc.rr.com/ramram/PCL%201.jpg\"]Very interesting grouping of 16 scorebooks, apparently kept by a scout, covering hundreds of PCL games between 1958 and 1969.  Most of the games are Vancouver, Tacoma and Seattle.  Some of the names I recall coming across are;  Brooks Robinson, Willie McCovey, Tony LaRussa, Lou Pineilla, Steve Carlton, Gaylord Perry and many others.  One game even had Satchell Paige pitching (the final game of the season) and I believe he would have been around 60 years old then.  There are also a smattering of professional games he went to including the Yankees/Braves World Series game.  SOLD[/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://home.kc.rr.com/ramram/baseball%20portsmouth%201.jpg\"]c. 1890 image of the minor league Portsmouth team.

He leans on a ring bat and has something white tucked into his belt.  This tintype is in better condition than most tintypes that I have seen but it does have some very light bends.  2 1/2\" x 3 1/2\". SOLD[/URL]\n\n\n[URL=\"http://home.kc.rr.com/ramram/A%20baseball%20team.jpg\"]Late 1870's cabinet card of the \"A\" team.

I am searching for any photos of the Washington Nationals from the 1860's and was wondering if you have any or have ever, in fact, seen any. It seems to me from your posting that you are pretty knowledgable about 19th century baseball images. I have been on a quest for quite some time.\n\nFrank Ceresi\n\n[url]http://www.fcassociates.com[/url]",
