Well, since I am also from Canada, no doubt you will have further expressions of sympathy for me.\n\nHowever, I can assure you (as can all my friends who have met Jennifer) that I came out exceedingly well in this regard.\n\nWith respect to Pop, I couldn't see that gfg.com still had one for sale, but another board member has graciously come to my aid.\n\n\n\nMax",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Max Weder\nMark\n\nIn hindsight, that must have been my subliminal motivation (can I pass it off by thinking I was looking for a card of Hilton Smith?).  However, when I visited the Canadian baseball hall of fame link here [url]http://www.baseballhalloffame.ca/index.cfm?sitename=news&newssub=induction[/url]  , I realize Pop is indeed making it.  It's also good to see local (Vancouver) legend trainer Hal Younker make it.\n\nActually, my spouse really was born in Digby [Pop's birthplace, for those too tired or bored to read the earlier posts on this thread].  She grew up in Bear River, the Switzerland of Nova Scotia, but perhaps better known for its abundance of a certain cash crop.  Her dad played senior league ball in the Annapolis Valley for a number of years, and I thought buying a Pop Smith card with the local connection would assuage her concern about the growing number of cards creeping into the bookshelves.\n\nMax",
