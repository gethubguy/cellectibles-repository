      "post_content": "Posted By: leon\nI have a carton of Duke Cameo cigarettes for sale. It is from South Africa and has no cards in the packs. The 50 packs are the same looking as the other ones that have cards and are extremely ornate.  They go for $100-$150 a pack in mint condition (which these are).  The carton is in fr-gd shape and the coupon is folded, as shipped, but otherwise almost mint. This would make a super display piece.......inquire for pricing......",
