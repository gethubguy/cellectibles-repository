      "post_content": "Posted By: Joshua\n1945 Mickey Livingston Chicago Cubs Vintage World Series Catchers Glove this item is believed to be game used and signed however due to the age of the glove it seems to be faded but you can still see it this would make a nice collectors item theres not another one out there of his. Im asking 600.00 or I would be willing to trade it for another members item. I will be putting the proceeds to huricane relief project that im doing . Any questions please feel free to reach me for photos.<br /> Thanks Joshua",
