I have a dog that looks just like the dog in the picture, and thats probably why this is the only Old Judge card that i really care to own.  If you have this card in a low grade, and would be interested in parting with it for a reasonable price, please send me an email and a scan if you have one.  Thank you very much.\n\nTate\ntate_davis@yahoo.com\n\nEdited to add my email address",
