They don\u2019t come much better than this - only one SGC George Gore N172 card is graded higher. So the story goes, this card was pulled directly from an Old Judge pack by the previous owner. $1200 or I'll use it to trade for a HOFer I need to upgrade.\n\n[IMG]http://members.aol.com/kkkkandp/gore.jpg[/IMG]",
