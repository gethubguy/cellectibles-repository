      "post_content": "Posted By: Frank Wakefield\n\nUPDATE\nTHESE CARDS, PLUS AN N172 DELAHANTY, WILL BE IN BILL GOODWIN'S NEXT AUCTION WWW.GOODWINANDCO.COM \n\n\nI have 2 ungraded N172 Old Judge cards I'm thinking about putting up on eBay... thought I'd see if any of you guys are interested in them first. Both cards are of players in the Hall of Fame.\n\nJohn Clarkson, Chicago batting\n\nAmos Rusie, Indianapolis right hand head high and spelled correctly\n\nI'm looking for about $800 for Clarkson, $1900 for Rusie. $100 off if you buy both. I'll pay all shipping, insurance, and tracking via USPS. \nOr make an offer, if you get close to that money the cards are yours, and eBay loses a fee. I'll send a few dollars to the man who pays for this site out of his own generous, well intentioned pocket.\n\nMy scans of the cards are about 220k, too big to upload, and I am sufficiently pc illiterate to be at a loss for how to attach them to this listing. I am able to attach to emails, and I will email scans to serious buyers. Frank. fwakefield1@comcast.net",
