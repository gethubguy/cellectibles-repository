I know him pretty well and I could tell that he is just teasing a little.  Scott actually made the post first about the W600 Cabinets a month or so ago.  \n\nI think that any seller of these GR8 cabinets would love to have two or three of us battle it out for them.  \n\nI know it's hard to keep track of everyone, and who knows who.   \nBrian Daniels writing pattern is the hardest to interpret.\n\nLeon is pretty EZ to figure out.. When he uses the smiley face [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG] logo that means he is happy and kidding.. When he uses the angry face [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/sad.gif[/IMG] logo he is mean and serious...\n\nJC",
