I'm looking for an inexpensive example or two that I can use to become more familiar with the cards before investing any serious dough into them.\n\nMy only requirements are that they measure out and are not skinned.  Willing to go up to $100 in this first foray.\n\nEmail me if you have any to spare!\n\nThanks as always!\n\nBill",
