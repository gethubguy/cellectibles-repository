      "post_content": "Posted By: barrysloate\nHi Hal- I have an N167 Welch in my November auction. It looks at least excellent but has some restoration. Bid will start low so if you can live with a restored card you will be down to two. Enjoy today's playoff game- I'll look for you behind the dugout. Regards, Barry Sloate",

      "post_content": "Posted By: barrysloate\nFrom what I can see, as well as what the consignor told me, there is a bit of reinking, which you can detect in the hair when you tilt the card under a light, and some paper restoration at the bottom banner where the name is that I am not able to detect. I would advise the winning bidder to leave it as it is. It looks great and removing any work that was done would just make matters worse. I'm starting it at $2500, a tiny fraction of what an excellent copy would ultimately sell for.",
