These are generally regarded as being more difficult than the numbered Boston examples with Lew Lipset suggesting this particular pose is the toughest - Encyclopedia of 19th Century Baseball cards.  Although I must say I've seen a couple of these surface over the last couple years.\n\nI'll start out by saying I was disappointed to have it recently sent back from SGC as trimmed.  Having been in my collection since 1990 without suspicion of any altering, I was disappointed but I trust SGCs opinion over mine after talking with them directly.  My loss.\n\nFar from perfect with dark staining & a pen mark across the chest but still a presentable N172 Kelly.\n\n$500 shipped\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1132108250.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1132108231.JPG[/IMG] \n\nRegards,\nJoe Gonsowski",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Joe_G.\nThe scan is accurate, looks like card when I hold them side by side (scan is much larger to show details).  The mark across the chest looks like ink, certainly left long ago.  Tough for me to say how the staining occurred.  Almost looks like a little tobacco & water got together.\n\nI would offer full refund minus shipping (say one week from receipt) to ensure you are happy with card.\n\nRegards,\nJoe G.",
