Dresses and shoes wear out or are worn only once or twice so there's nothing wrong with a piece of cardboard that can bring us an infinite amount of joy whenever we see it or think about it. \n\nWe NEED cardboard!",

But, I'll give it a shot.  I'd trade it for one of the three shown below:\n\n1) an upgrade to my e90-1 Joe Jackson, I have a PSA1 and would like to get to a PSA 3 or 4, or\n2) a T204 Ramly Walter Johnson, or\n3) a rare back T206 of a HOFer.\n\n\nI realize, I'll need to send you significant cash back to you for 1 above (perhaps 2 if you have a reasonably graded one), but let me know.  I also have an N28 Anson PSA 3, but the situation would have to be \"just right\" to pry that out of my hands.",
