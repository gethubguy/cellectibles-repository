So, I'll start here and if there aren't any replies, I'll pick another subforum, and so on.\n\nActually I've got 2 questions.\n\n1) What, if any, is the standard method of settlement for purchases/sales on the B/S/T forum.\n\nIs it like eBay, where funds are sent first, then the product follows, or is it a matter decided between the people involed in the transaction?\n\n2) With eBay fees, why would a seller use eBay rather than this board to sell an item?\n\nIf this seems like a dumb question, it probably is.
