      "post_content": "Posted By: David Levin\nFOR A LIMITED TIME WE NOW HAVE IN STOCK SOME HIGH QUALITY LOUPES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS CONVIENIENCE. \n\n\nWe are offering two styles of these powerful Loupes. First is a split loop with two 15 power lenses when combined give you magnification of 30. Nothing gets past this one. \nSecond is a single lense loupe with magnfication of 20 times, and it has a built in light and is battery operated.\nThe batter is the same type that runs many watches and it comes with a mini screwdriver for easy replacement as well.\nThe really nice thing about these loupes is the size, so many high power loupes have such small lenses that it is difficult to use them. These are easy to use.\nThank you,\nDavid Levin\n\n[url]http://gfg.com/baseball/loupe.shtml[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://www.gfg.com/baseball/loupes.jpg[/IMG]",
