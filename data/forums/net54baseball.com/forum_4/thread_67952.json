I have bought several types of loupes before as I am sure many of you have.  Always disappointed in what I received!  This time I found a very nice loupe, 30X and bought one.  I liked it so much I went back to get more, and found that they also had 20X loupes with a light, and easy to use.  So, I bought some of those as well.  I am selling these on my website for $22.95 ea.\n\nFor a limited time, I will sell to Members of the board, if you mention this ad for $21.95, and I will pay the postage.  The offer is good for orders through Tuesday Feb. 28.  After that, they will still be available at the great price of $22.95 and you pay the shipping.\n\n[URL=\"https://www.gfg.com/baseball/loupe.shtml\"] \n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/baseball/loupes.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nIf you click on the image above it should take you to the page where  you can order these.  Write in the comments field of the order form that you saw the ad on the Network 54 Board for the discount.\n\nThanks\n\nDave",
