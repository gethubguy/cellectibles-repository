A couple of these have recently popped up on ebay, but I havent had any luck on the bigger items lately.  Was hoping to try and find one in low/mid grade, something in the $1400 and less category if at all possible- the cheaper, the better.  Please let me know if anyone has anything within this price range, or any leads as to where I might can find one. thanks, michelle",
