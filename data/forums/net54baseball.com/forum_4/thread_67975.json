      "post_content": "Posted By: identify7\nI need one OJ more than others - a Maines, St. Paul (or Pauls) pose: hands at neck.\n\nI have never seen a scan of this pose. I imagine that it represents the start of a pitching motion, because other poses display the process of release of the ball.\n\nI realize that you may be at a show, come across a Maines card, and wonder what pose I need. So I will include this description as my login name in future posts, In the hope that you will then remember which pose I need; and maybe work out some deal insuring that the seller will hold the card until I get him his price.\n\nBoy, this is getting long winded, and confusing. If you have to put some money down on the card, of course I will reimburse you and include some extra for the inconvenience (sometimes money at a show can be very important).\n\nAnyway, lets see how this works; I've been looking for this card since the very early '80s - when I got my first two Maines cards from Lipsett. One to go.\n\nWell, I slipped into the phone booth and changed into my new superhero costume - it turned out ok. I wanted it to read Maines/HandsAtNeck, but it comes out upsidedown, but you will know.\nHelp me if you can & I will find a way to reciprocate.",
