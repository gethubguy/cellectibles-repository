In any case, George Streif was the first guy to get 4 triples in a game (Bill Joyce was the other).\n\nSo, I will modify my request to delete this OJ - and you get full credit for simplifying my wantlist!\n\nThank you.",

Even lower grade examples in the $50 - $75 range often are cards which have quite a bit of trimming and no back on them because they perhaps were glued into a scrapbook and had to be skinned out. N172s under $50 are not frequently encountered (by me); but may be an interesting option.",
