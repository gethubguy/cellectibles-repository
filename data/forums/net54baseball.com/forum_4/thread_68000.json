If you don't have the scans I'll resend them tonight.  Marc- I'm waiting on one other person about the Haddock, once I hear from him, I'll let you know.  Please rest assured if you've emailed me I've got you on my radar screen.  Am taking the emails in the order they are received so it may take a little while for me to get back to everyone, but I will.  I'll also update this page tonight to indicate which Mayos have been sold and which are left.  Thanks, Dave",
