Please note the only card with a wrinkle is the Edwards and it runs through the lower left hand corner of the card. The Crocker also has a light indent on the left hand side, possibly from a fingernail. $150 takes home the lot or $50 per card. Please add $5 for shipping. Thanks\n\n[URL=\"http://imageshack.us\"][IMG]http://img119.imageshack.us/img119/8169/n28s3dt.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
