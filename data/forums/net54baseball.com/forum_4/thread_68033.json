The Brouthers is Gd-VG (other than trimming) with a beautiful photo-$1650 shipped. The Anson has a pin-hole at the very top, tiny corner crease at lower left, and small paper loss at the top 2 corners on the blank back, but very good contrast for an Anson-$3950 shipped. Scans upon request. Plenty of N54 and ebay references.",
