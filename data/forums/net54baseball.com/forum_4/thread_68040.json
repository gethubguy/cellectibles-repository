I included large scans but the side of the card in the top right is cut off in the picture (not really like that in real life). All cards present very well and would make a great addition to any collection. Please email me if interested in any and for a better description of them. The Ives which has an ex+ front does have an extremely minor corner wrinkle that only shows through the back. Thanks.",
