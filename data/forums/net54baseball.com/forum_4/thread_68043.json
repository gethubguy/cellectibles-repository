I am not sure what I paid for all of them a few years ago, but I am pretty sure that this is now below cost.  I cannot go any lower than this.  \n\nE-mail inquiries to pmifsud3d@gmail.com\n\nJune 6, 1885 - Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper - \"The Chicago Baseball Club\" - Half page (page no. 253) - Featuring Cap Anson (front/center)\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c322/T206Collector/ChicagoTeam.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nAugust 5, 1882 - Harper's Weekly - \"The Metropolitan Baseball Nine\" - Full page (page no. 493)\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c322/T206Collector/Harpers1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nSeptember 30, 1882 - Harper's Weekly - \"The Providence Baseball Club\" - Full page (page no. 621) - featuring Harry Wright, Charles Radbourn, George Wright and J.M.

It's a little too big to misplace, and the only other possibility is it was destroyed. And why would that be? Always been one of the hobby's great mysteries.",
