Jim also bought a blue light from K-mart so he can have sales. That's after he gets back from the used car lot where he also sells cards.....  Only sells cars that little 'ole gramma drove to Sunday church. \"IT's a great deal.\"  Hopefully we can keep correcting Jim until he get's it...(hi Jim)",

We are assuming I guess that all pose's are on both, N172 and 3's, at this point .  So with all that being said, This is a known common Goodwin & Co. cabinet with a common pose. Just know one has it ... Forsale for $299.\n\nThis all in good fun Jay.",
