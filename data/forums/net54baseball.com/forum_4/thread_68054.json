Has Jamestown, NY on the right side of mount. Very unique piece ex condition $350 Firm\n\nDon't know the team but with the amount of people watching I would assume a major league or minor league team of some sort. Maybe someone knows the stadium (pretty good size stadium for 1886??) Stereoview is dated 1886 and Jamestown, NY?? Call to reserve 614 562 2421",
