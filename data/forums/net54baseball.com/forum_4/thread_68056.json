      "post_content": "Posted By: Jon Canfield\nRecently I came across a Lone Jack tin in a little better condition than this one here so I'm offering it up for sale or trade.  I really don't have any price or trades in mind - just figured I'd see if there is any interest.  The tin, overall, grades probably around a 3.  The top and sides are all very legible and the overall eye appeal is great.  The sides are actually in much better condition than the top.There are no major dents in the tin, only a little \"indentation\" on the top.  There is NO outer rust and the inside is is in good shape.  The hinge works perfectly - the tin opens and closes without problems.  The tin dates from the 1880's and is produced by Carroll, which as we all know, produced this N370's.  Although it is unlikely the cards were packaged in this tin (as opposed to the cigarette box configuration), this tin dates from the exact time period as the issue and would be a wonderful addition to an early collection.  (Take in mind that less than 5 Lone Jack cigarette boxes are known to exist and all are wouth well over 4-figures).  If you have any offers, feel free to email me.\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1155141056.JPG[/IMG]",
