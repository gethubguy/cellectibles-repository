Feel free to check out the other B/S/T threads for other type cards I currently have for sale. Anything that doesn't sell will make its way to eBay eventually. Prices include shipping and handling. Insurance, if desired, will be a bit extra. Payment options are PayPal, International Money Order or Bank Transfer. Scans available on request. First come first served, so react quickly!\n\n----- Tim Keefe  -  N28 - 1887 Allen & Ginter  -  GAI 2  -  $475.00 \n----- John Clarkson  -  N284 - 1887 Buchner Gold Coin  -  SGC 60  -  $1,450.00",
