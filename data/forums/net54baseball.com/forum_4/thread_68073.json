      "post_content": "Posted By: Paul\nI've upgraded my N172 O'Rourke and now have this one for sale.  It has a crack extending across the photo.  The cardboard backing is not cracked, but has a light crease in the same spot as the crack in the photo.  There is also a chip in the surface layer in the left border, right at the crack, and another chip in the surface layer in the lower right corner.  The photo quality is pretty nice for an Old Judge.  \n\nThe price is $465 postpaid.  One of the cheapest Old Judge Hall of Famers you'll find -- and it's not even Tommy McCarthy.  Please email me at both pstewart@kmob.com and pch103@yahoo.com.  Thanks.\n\nPaul\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1156479410.JPG[/IMG] \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1156479436.JPG[/IMG]",
