N302's usually pop up on eBay sporadically but you can count on at least a dozen per year in more acceptable shape than this one.  \n\n[url]http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=019&item=290030987142&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&rd=1[/url]\n\nIf you have the change, Joe Colabella always has a great selection. \n\n[url]http://www.joecolabella.com/[/url]\n\nAs you know these are tough cards in any condition and harder to find than their N300 counterparts.  Best of luck (that your wife doesn't catch you).",
