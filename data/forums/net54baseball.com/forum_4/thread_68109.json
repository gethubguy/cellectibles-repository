As I stated in the email, I just settled on the sale of my house, and as you can guess, I had a very hectic weekend moving out.  Your tin went out via prioirity mail on Wednesday, and you should recieve it anyday.\nSorry for the delay.  I should have emailed you on Wednesday after I sent it but it slipped my mind.  And I honestly only received 1 email from you, and to that one I replied immediately.",
