      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhys Yeakley\n(2) 100% Original photographs of Ted Kennedy (the pitcher from 1884-86).  He was one of the greatest pitching prodegies of the early 1880's and was a fine major leaguer as well as one of the most interesting people ever to play the game.  After baseball he invented baseball gloves, ran a baseball correspondance school for a time and died very young in 1907.  He is also pictured in the Old Judge set.  These photos date from his 1904 stint as the majors first ever hitting coach with the St. Louis Browns and he is in FULL UNIFORM and a great pitching pose.  I have (2) different available and they measure about 5X7 each.  Scans available upon request and I have provided a link to his SABR biography below.\n\nYour choice for $325 each or both for $600 shipped.  \n\n<a href=\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=873&pid=7432\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=873&pid=7432</a[/url]>",

The link takes you to his biography as he was a pretty neat character that most people probably do not know about.  These are Rare Cyanotype photos which were popular from around 1898-1907 or so.
