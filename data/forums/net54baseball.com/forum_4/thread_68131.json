Nice, glossy, virtually flawless surface with no creasing or wrinkling anywhere.  Very slight corner wear is all that really keeps this card at a \"3\".  The back is mostly clean and entirely damage free as well.  \n\nAsking $625 delivered or would accept partial trade as well.  Any questions, feel free to ask!\n\n***Card has been sold.  Thank you for the inquiries***\n\n-Brian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1162600888.JPG[/IMG]",
