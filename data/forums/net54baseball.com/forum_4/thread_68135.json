      "post_content": "Posted By: Marc S.\nMastro [and most major auctions] basically put their auctions up online before making it available to the public.  A dedicated [e.g. nerdy freak] collector can just follow the lot numbers and manually change the url address for each specific lot.  So it is not user friendly, but the auction is definitely up.\n\nAs an example, you can check the following URL\n\n[url]http://www.mastronet.com/index.cfm?action=DisplayContent&ContentName=Lot%20Information&LotIndex=66975[/url]\n\nIf you really want to see every lot in the current auction, it would probably take you a few hours of just changing URLs.  That said, you can change in groups of 25 or 50 to get a feel for the general category you are surfing in.\n\nAnd, for what it is worth, the link above is to a Just So Burkett card that was discussed on Net 54 at great length in the past.  I did not specifically save any URLs for the Mayos, I just remember seeing them.  And I have nothing consigned to this auction.\n\nAlso - my suggestion is just to be patient.  I imagine that a preview of the auction will be up on Monday at noonish, although I don't know that for a fact.\n\n~ms",
