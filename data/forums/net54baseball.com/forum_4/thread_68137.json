These are Babcock's Moral, Instructive, and Amusing Toy books, published in New Haven by S. Babcock.  I have one of the books with writing inside the front cover which dates these to 1853.  (the book with the date is not one of the two that I am trading) One of the woodcut panels on the front cover appears to be kids playing baseball.\n\n$25 each includes shipping and 100% satisfaction money back guarantee.\n\nThanks!  \n\nRick\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/babcock.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/babcock001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/babcock002.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/babcock003.jpg[/IMG]",
