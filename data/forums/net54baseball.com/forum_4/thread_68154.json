Perhaps you might have better luck if you let everyone know how much you have to spend.  If you happen to get 10 offers for Connor cards then you may consider the offer a tad bit generous.   In the past few months I've seen two Connor cards sell for less than a grand.  Each had some pretty big issues though.  I figure you might find a decent one for about $1200+",
