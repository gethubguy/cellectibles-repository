      "post_content": "Posted By: Dave Levin\nDave did it again.  We picked up a beautiful lot of Old Judge cards that have never previously been offered to the hobby.\nMuch like the Oregon find, we were contacted by the children of a 93 year old woman who was in possession of her fathers childhood collection.  \nJ. E. Woodward of Greenville Ill collected these as a 12 to 14 year old boy.\nThe grand daughter never knew he was a card collector as they were never shown to her.  Most likely these cards spent many years in a cigar box, not seeing the light of day.\nThere are many nice cards, some tough hall of fame players, lots of cards from teams a little farther west.\nAll of the card images are up at my site: https://www.gfg.com/oldjudge/if1.shtml\n\nHere is a sample:\n\n[IMG]https://www.gfg.com/oldjudge/sample.jpg[/IMG]  \n\n\nI do not have them all priced yet, I am working on it, if you see something you like ask for a price.\n\nThanks\n\nDave",

Not really interested in the price. \n\nWasn't it quite a rush (70's talk) to see the cards on the kitchen table or wherever when you walked in. Did they come from the attic or basement. I take it the 93 year old guy died.\nunbelievable find.  Any others cards with this you did not get? etc....\n\n\nfill us in",
