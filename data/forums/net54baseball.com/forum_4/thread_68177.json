      "post_content": "Posted By: Zach Rice\nI am now open to accepting offers on my N36 card of Yellow Flower. These are very difficult cards and have some of the best images of any set produced in the 19th century. This card is no exception. It suffers from minor corner wear, a black mark along with a smudge of dirt on the back and some white residue, and wrinkling that goes vertically from the top to the bottom of the card. The wrinkling can not be seen in the scan and can only really been seen in person with tilting the card in the light a certain way. I am open to any offers and also trade. I am mostly interested in series two of both the T209 and T210 set. Thanks.\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/n36yellowflower.jpg[/IMG]",
