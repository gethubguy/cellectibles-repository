I'm not sure why the qualifier except it may have some faded mark ? on back between oarsmen and rifle shooters list. If it is, its hard to see and not obtrusive at all. The front is very clean and evenly rounded corners with NO creases.\nReduced to 575.00 shipped and Insured\nThanks for looking\nJerry\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1167844379.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1167844475.JPG[/IMG]",
