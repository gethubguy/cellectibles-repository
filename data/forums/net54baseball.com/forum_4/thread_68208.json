Come on guys, there's a card on ebay right now that's not nearly as nice as any of these three and that will get bought for more than I'm offering these for.\n\nI'll also trade for anything on my Old Judge want list in a similar condition.",

I believe Kevin already marked the cards down, two SGC30s & an SGC10.  Not bad prices for graded OJs, just not on my want list.\n\nBest Regards,\nJoe Gonsowski",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Dave\nYou are right Joe, I meant that they were relatively common within the N172 set, but compared to other cards they surely aren't. I rarely buy graded Old Judges so I am not that familiar with the currrent market prices. I defer to collectors like yourself who are more knowledgeable about the 19th century issues. I just recently started collecting the N172 cards, and am still learning as I go",
