      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\nTerrific looking card.  No creases, edgewear or significant staining.  The corners are mostly sharp as well with only slight touches.  There is a qualifier on the card due to a pinkish looking printer's line on the back of the card towards the top.  The back also exhibits some very mild toning.  Overall, still a very attractive piece though.  Asking $285 delivered.  \n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com",
