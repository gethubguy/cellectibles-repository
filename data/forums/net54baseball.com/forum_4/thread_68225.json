Some of you may know me from all the 1911 E94s I have been selling off over the last 3-4 months (ebay id: baseballcardinvestments).\n\nI am currently looking for an 1887 N28 Cap Anson in PSA 6, 7, or 8. If anyone has any leads, let me know. Thanks.\n\nDon\n\nPS - I have a few other items I am looking for right now (e.g., T206s) and will post on the appropriate board.",
