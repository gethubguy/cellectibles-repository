I will pay all shipping except on the 2 banners. Those I plan on giving to Mailboxes etc for packing/ shipping and charging the buyer 1/2 the total cost. First come, first served.\n\n\n[URL=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/For%20Sale/n162_glass397.jpg\"]N162 Jack Glass[/URL] SGC 40 [URL=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/For%20Sale/n162_glass398.jpg\"]photo 2[/URL] [URL=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f92/vwtdi55/For%20Sale/n162_glass396.jpg\"]photo 3[/URL] One of the nicer SGC 40 Glasscocks you'll see. If you tilt the card, you can see some diagonal surface \"wrinkling\" starting at Jack's left calf extending towards the lower right corner of the card. This is not visable looking at the card straight on. An SGC 40 example just sold in Goodwin's auction last night for 1710 plus juice, this one is nicer.
