      "post_content": "Posted By: Preece1\nI am looking for an 1887 Four Base Hits card of either Ward, Keefe, Welch or Clarkson.  I will trade 1894 Ned Hanlon Alpha or Wilbert Robinson Alpha + Cash.  Or just all cash.\n\nIf you are not interested in selling or trading, I would still like to see a scan of the card that you have if possible.\n\nI will pay a nice cash reward for introducing me to a collector that has one of these cards if I am able to successfully buy the card.",
