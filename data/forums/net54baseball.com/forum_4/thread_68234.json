      "post_content": "Posted By: Keith\nHello guys,\n\nI have the following 3 baseball photographs for sale.\n\n1.  1890s Indoor Baseball team photograph - $225 obo\n2.  1880s to 1890s McGranville NY team photo $120 obo\n3.  late 19th - early 20th century BPI small team photo $60\nEmail me at kjjavic@aol.com if you have interest.\n\nIndoor baseball photo:\nsize is of board is about 15 by 12, photo is about 8 x 10.\nThe players names are listed on the bottom of the photo.\n1 of the players listed is Wm Reidy, who I believe is Bill Reidy who played professional baseball from 1896 to 1904.  Reidy grew up in the Loraine,OH area.  I found a YMCU associated with the railroads companies of Ohio founded in Cleveland in 1879.  The major railroad company in Cleveland was the Cleveland,Lorain, and wheeling railroad Co.  One of the bigwigs of this railroad co. was Decatur Axtell who resided in Loraine OH, and who had a son named Frederick Axtell born in 1873 (F. Axtell in photo?).  The Quigley family was one of the founding families of Loraine, and 2 Quigleys are in the photo.  I believe this photo dates to around 1891 with Reidy and Axtell being about 18 year old.  \n\nMcGranville photo:\nsize of board is around 12 by 9, and the photo is about 8 x 10.  \nThe photo has a fellow in the back row in a nice bib style jersey.\n\nBPI photo:\nboard is 5 x 6, photo is about 4 x 5. \nThe players wear uniforms with BPI on them.  Possibly a Baltimore Polytechnic Institute team photo?  There is a rug in front of the players thats says something Avery.  I cannot make it out for sure.  \n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/IndoorBaseball1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/IndoorBaseball3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/IndoorBaseball2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/mcgranvillelow.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/bpi.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/BPIcloseupMed.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
