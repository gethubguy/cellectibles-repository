      "post_content": "Posted By: Eric\nI would like to purchase maybe a couple Old Judge N172 cards.  I don't own any, but would love to get my hands on some just to say that I have them.  They don't have to be graded, nor in the best shape.  Actually almost any condition will do as long as the picture is not completely faded out and as long as there are no significant pieces missing.\n\nIf you have any, email scans and your asking price to:  kremocolyzarc@hotmail.com\n\nI have PAYPAL funds available.  If that doesn't work for you I can also send a check.  I'm not looking for anything that will break my bank account.  Thank you in advance and I hope to deal with you.\n\n\nEdited:  \"Low end\" in the title was meant to describe the quality in the cards I was looking for.  I took it out for clarification.\n\nEdited:  Changed the title.  I am no longer looking for N172 cards for the time being.  Thanks for the help guys. \n\n-Eric",
