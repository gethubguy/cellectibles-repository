      "post_content": "Posted By: scott brockelman\n I have for sale a 1889 Levi A. Gold CDV Cabinet Card- Cincinnati Reds Baseball Team-15 players pictured- all portrait shots- incl. Bid McPhee, Aaron Stern(Pres), Jim Keenan, Lee Viau, Elmer Smith,Tony Mullane, Hick Carpenter, Bug Holliday, George Tebeau, Hugh Nicol, Kid Baldwin, John Reilly, Ollie Beard, Manager Gus Schmelz and another player on bottom right whose identification is faded, could be  Harry Stern(Sec) or player Billy Earle, might be Duyea as well. All of the players are identified in very small text below their photo.\n\n Looks vg with some spotting- had some pencil writing on left border which has been erased and leaves an impression only, not visible with the naked eye and a pin hole at top,which has been fairly neatly reclosed.\n\nOverall a very attractive early piece of Cinc. Reds baseball history. Team cabinets such as these are fairly scarce, this is an early professional team. the equivalent cards of these players would be over $10,000. A chance to own the entire team. \n\n***********PRICE REDUCED************\n$4,500 cash or desirable trade material considered.\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.auctionhawk.com/upload/sb1/2991352-MVC-335F.JPG[/IMG]",
