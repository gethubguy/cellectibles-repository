      "post_content": "Posted By: Americas Arts\nAmericas' Arts L.L.C. is a private art dealer who recently was asked to handle a 19th C. lithograph, approx. 16.25\u201d X 10\u201d, identified as a Supplement to the Baltimore American, May 22, 1888, and published by Forbes Litho. 1896 Boston, MA.  \"The National Game of Base Ball.\"  You can see from the three photos that the piece has some damage to the extreme corners, but nothing at all on the main image or interior of the print.  Color and consistency across the paper is very high.  From a standpoint of 100+ year old ephemera, I would describe it as in Very Good (+) condition.\nWe have discovered the following data from the 1995 Maine Antiques Digest concerning a similar piece, in an auction more than 10 years ago.\n\nLive Baseball Auction Brings Over $100,000\nHunt Auctions, Exton, Pennsylvania \n by Lita Solis-Cohen\n\u00a9 1995 by Maine Antique Digest\n. . .
