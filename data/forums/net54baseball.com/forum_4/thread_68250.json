      "post_content": "Posted By: Keith\nUp for sale I have a 1893 newspaper from Philadelphia called \"Sporting Item\".  It has numerous articles about baseball, boxing, crew, horse racing, and numerous other sports.  Only a small article on football - if there was more football content I'd be keeping it.  There are 4 pages (well actually 2 back and front)\n\nSome of the focuses of the baseball articles are the St Louis Browns signing Caruthers, the possible retirement of Fred Pfeiffer and Walter Wilmont (the article states that Pfeiffer thinks there is more money in red eye than baseball and might take a job in the liquor industry - however according to a little research, i don't think either player retired until a few years later - they sound a little like brett favre to me), articles about Ward and Delehanty and much more.  There is also an interesting article which discusses the rising player salaries, and the fact that all of the ball teams lost money the previous season.\nOverall a neat step back in time.\n\nI am asking $200 for the paper.\nemail me at kjjavic@aol.com\n\nthanks\nKJ\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/front.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/back.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/pfeiffer.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/pf2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/ward.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/delahanty.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://photobucket.com\"][IMG]http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n193/kjjavic/roster.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
