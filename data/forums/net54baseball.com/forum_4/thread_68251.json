      "post_content": "Posted By: Dylan\n8x10 photo backed on cardboard (i have little experience in photos) of Minor league team issued in 1893, as i was told by Jim Manos. Team name, \"Brooklyn Edison\" shown on uniforms of players. Upper right hand corner is missing small piece. There is a seperation running through the middle of the photograph which can be seen. If the photo was backed with new cardboard the split could be eliminated I imagine. The image is sharp, and the photo is overall pretty clean. There are no pen/pencil markings and almost no creasing. The imperfections are pretty much outside of the image of the ballplayers except for the split. A high resolution scan can be emailed. Any reasonable offer wont be refused. email at bgspsa1@yahoo.com\n[URL=\"http://img80.imageshack.us/my.php?image=emailhr8.jpg\"][IMG]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9601/emailhr8.th.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
