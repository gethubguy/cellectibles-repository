      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\nTerrific looking card. No creases, edgewear or significant staining. The corners are mostly sharp as well with only slight touches. There is a qualifier on the card due to a hard-to-see pinkish looking printer's line on the back of the card towards the top.  Overall, still a very attractive piece though. Asking $285 delivered. \n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1174697687.JPG[/IMG]",
