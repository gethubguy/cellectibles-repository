The magazines contain hundreds of woodcut ads, including ads for Reach Baseball Guides, Spaldings Athletic Rules, Peck and Snyder Baseball Badges, and Peck and Snyders Mail Order Catalogue.  The hardcover binding is in bad shape, with the front page competely loose.  The cover measures approximately 11 1/2 x 16.  \n\nPaypal is preferred, but checks and money orders are fine.\n\n$45 shipped.\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lawsons001-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lawsons002-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lawsons003-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lawsons004-1.jpg[/IMG]",
