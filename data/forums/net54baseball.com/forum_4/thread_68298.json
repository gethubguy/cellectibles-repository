      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian C.\nIt's amazing this has survived; a score card of a baseball game between the \"Cincinnatis\" and the \"St. Pauls\" in Hot Springs, Arkansas. It dates to 1890 or 1891 based on the players listed. Bid McPhee got a hit in the ninth. It's in remarkable condition. There's a fold from left to right across the middle, and an incorrect date of 1903 written in small print in light pencil on the otherwise blank back. This is surely a one of a kind piece. $285.00.\n\n[IMG]http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j154/bcampf/scorecardfront.jpg[/IMG]",
