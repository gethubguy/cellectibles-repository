      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nGood Morning, Collectors:\n\nI am now asking $3,500 on a VERY COOL and VERY SCARCE 1886 J. Wood Studio Cabiet Card of HOF Great, Tim Keefe, which has been authenticated and encapsulated by SGC. This image of Keefe is the same one used to produce his extremely rare 1886 NY Giants Rookie Card and this collectible was actually issued prior to the Keefe Giants Rookie Card. \n\nPlease review scans of the front and back of the card for condition. When will you ever get another chance to purchase an 1886 Keefe graded card???\n\nIf interested, please e-mail me at: vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/TKeefe.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/TKeefeB.jpg[/IMG]",
