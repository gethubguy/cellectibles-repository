Unfortunately I wasn't the original submitter of the card so I'm unaware of the reason.\n\nI purchased the card approx. 3 years ago already in its GAI slab, and upon receiving it judged the left edge to be trimmed. It's also possible a couple other edges may have been lightly trimmed, though the borders are good size all round and all advertising etc. unaffected. Card presents as a good size Old Judge.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nRegards\nDaniel\n\n\nEdited to add extra explanation",
