I will be adding additional baseball memorabilia over the next few days, including Japanese 1911-ish postcards, an 1880's cricket buckle, gorgeous 1920-ish W&D baseball suit (truly suit quality).\n\nHere's the current list, but look for more additions - about 40 more items to add.  Thanks, Scott\n\n[url]http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ25QQsassZrunscott[/url]",
