      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nGood Morning, Collectors:\n\nI am now asking $350 on a VERY COOL and VERY SCARCE 1889 Chicago Base Ball Currency picturing HOF Greats, Albert Spalding & Adrian \"Cap\" Anson along with the other members of the 1889 Chicage team. As all of you Hall of Fame collectors surely recognize, there are very few career contemporary collectibles of Albert Spalding and this piece would make a great addition to an advanced Hall of Famer collection. The sponsor's name on the Currency is Adolph Hilb \"Rochelle's One Price\" Clothier along with the 1889 date. Please see scans of the front and back of the currency for condition details and I will mention that there is a tear that goes through the piece just to the right of the 1889 on the front and it has been expertly repaired but is still visible.\n\nIf interested, please e-mail me at: vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/ASpalding.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/ASpaldingB.jpg[/IMG]",
