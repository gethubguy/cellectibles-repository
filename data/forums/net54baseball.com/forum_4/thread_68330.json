      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nUp for sale is a beautiful 1898 Cameo Pepsin Pin of Hugh Jennings graded a PSA 6 and pictures the HOF'er on his earliest known collectible other than the unique copy of his 1894 Alpha Photo Engraving card, of which only one copy is known to exist. A great piece for those HOF RC collectors out there and currently a 1/1 as no other copy has ever been graded by PSA!!! I am asking $1,750 for the Jennings pin and the first e-mail I receive that says \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. Thank you for your interest.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/HJennings.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/HJenningsB.jpg[/IMG]",
