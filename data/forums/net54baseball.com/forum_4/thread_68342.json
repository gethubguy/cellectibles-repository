General (or One Star General for all you civilians [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]).  However, if you want it, you can have it for $500 (inludes shipping with Delivery Confirmation).  This will be basically what I have in this card.  Only selling due to a recent large purchase.  Please e-mail me at joejackson1919@comcast.net if you want the card.  Thanks for looking!\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1186081740.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1186081752.JPG[/IMG]",
