      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nUp for sale is a beautiful 1898 Cameo Pepsin Pin of Bid McPhee graded by PSA and displaying the best image of any Cameo Pepsin Gum Pin that I have ever come across. PSA has given the pin a technical grade of \"1\" due to back damage/rust and the absence of most of the Whitehead & Hoag label found on the back of the Cameo Pepsin Gum Pin. A great piece for those HOF RC collectors out there as the only other career contemporary piece picturing McPhee by himself is the very scarce and highly expensive 1887-90 Old Judge card. Currently, this beautiful McPhee Pin is a 1/1 as no other copy has ever been graded by PSA!!! I am asking $3,000 for the Bid McPhee Cameo Pepsin Gum Pin and the first e-mail I receive that says \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. Thank you for your interest.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BMcPhee.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BMcPheeB.jpg[/IMG]",
