      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nGood Evening, Collectors:\n\nUp for sale is a very scarce 1895 Mayo Cut Plug Ed Delahanty HOF card which has been professionally graded a PSA 2 by the leading third-party authenticator in the business. As you HOF collectors know, there are very few career contemporary cards of Delahanty and his Mayo card is certainly one of his two most popular along with the Old Judge. Please review enlarged scans of the front and back of the card for condition details.\n\nMy sale price on the Delahanty card is $3,750 and the first e-mail that I receive that states \"I'll take it\" will be the new owner of this treasure. My e-mail address is: vguerrerobb@yahoo.com.\n\nThank you for your interest and good luck!\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/EDelahanty.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/EDelahantyB-1.jpg[/IMG]",
