About 3/4\" shorter than a N173, same width as a N173.  Nice picture of several ring bats and a nice catcher's mask to boot!  This crew looks like a bunch from Gilligan's Island [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]  Paypal preferred.  Thanks for looking!\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1187456263.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1187456277.JPG[/IMG] \n\n$350 Delivered.  Was sold to me as being a Harvard team from the late 1870's.  Not sure if it is or not but definitely a team from around the Boston area.  Roughly the same size as a N173.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1187456306.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1187456320.JPG[/IMG]",
