I am interested in buying or trading for this N172 Latham pose if available. I have checked the inventory already of Dave Levin and Bruce Kasarda. If you have the card in stock or know where to find one let me know. Thanks.\n\nDave \n\n[IMG]http://i231.photobucket.com/albums/ee150/Bagger77/N173_Latham_Proof.jpg[/IMG]",
