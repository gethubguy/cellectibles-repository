      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian McQueen\nHere's a really attractive example of an n43 available for sale or trade.  I'm not sure why the qualifier exists however my best guess is that the spot of residue on the front would be the reason for it.  Aside from that, the card is in terrific shape.  Mostly sharp corners, no creases/wrinkling and the back is clean and damage free.  Below are some cards from my wantlist that I could use and I would trade very generously for many of these items.  I am open to other trade ideas or would sell the card directly for $1100.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian\nredmaccie@hotmail.com\n\ne103 Tenny or Chance\nz11 Halla, Arlett, Fullerton, Miller (need 1912 too), Lindsay and Seaton\ne90-3 Hahn or Payne\nt209 BE Thompson\nd322 Mascot, Forbes Field, Dreyfuss\nt209-1 McGeehan or Fullenwider\nany 1918 Zeenut              \n1909 Obak Horizontals              \ne90-1 - Bill Sweeney Shean             \nt204 - Archer Gessler Pelty Paskert Tenney Bransfield Elberfield Morgan       \nm116 Karger, Coveleski, Foster, Frill, Hughes, Krueger, Mitchell, OHara, Perring, Ray, Seymour, McConnell (chi) or McQuillen (Cin)              \ne102 Doyle (batting) e102 Miller (fielding) or Schmidt             \nt205 Gray (stats on back) Moran Wilhelm (\"suffe ed\") Latham Leifeld          \ne97 Steinfeld             \nt207 Kuhn Donnelly Pelty Ragan McCarty Peters Bauman Works Mogridge Kling Downey Tyler W.
