      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nUp for sale is a beautiful 1898 Cameo Pepsin Pin of Bid McPhee displaying the best image contrast of any Cameo Pepsin Gum Pin that I have ever come across. A great piece for those HOF RC collectors out there as the only other career contemporary piece picturing McPhee by himself is the very scarce and highly expensive 1887-90 Old Judge card. I am asking $2,000 for the Bid McPhee Cameo Pepsin Gum Pin and the first e-mail I receive that says \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. Thank you for your interest.\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BMcPhee-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BMcPheeB-1.jpg[/IMG]",
