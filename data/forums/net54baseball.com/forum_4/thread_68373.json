I would consider only Detroit N173 Cabinets, Tomlinson Detroit Cabinets, possibly any N172 Detroit Players that I need. Proof would be valued at $5000.00 plus. Is this a realistic possibility?\n\nThanks joe\n\nTy Cobb, Spikes flying!\n\n\nMy MILFORD97@AOL.COM EMAIL IS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW. Someone emailed me and I could not read the note before aol went down, Please resend the email to\n\nJMAPLES0871@CHARTER.NET\n\nThanks Joe",
