Game was between Boston and Philly.  SOLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal 1860's Team Silk ribbon from the Erie Baseball Club.  Name of DW Tuttle 1st Base.  These were used essentially as uniforms before teams had their own uniform specs.  Erie was a high level club from the era but I know nothing of this particular player.  Nice condition.  $1500\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1189125586.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1189125678.JPG[/IMG]",
