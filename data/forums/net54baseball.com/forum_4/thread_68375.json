The newspaper contains a 4x6 Woodcut of \"John Montgomery Ward, The Famous Short-Stop, New York Baseball Club.\"  There is also a short article about Ward. The woodcut is in nice shape, although the magazine has some pages that have come apart from the binding, and some of the pages were not cut apart at the printers.\n\n$75 shipped.  Price reduced to $49.  PayPal is preferred but not required.\n\nThank you!\nRick\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lesllies001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/lesllies.jpg[/IMG]",
