      "post_content": "Posted By: Rick McQuillan\nHi,\nI have Harper's Young People Magazine from May 5, 1885.  The front cover of the magazine is a woodcut advertising for Lawson's Patent Base-Ball Game with cards.  The cover and the pages are starting to come loose from the binding, but overall this is in nice condition.  The magazine is filled with articles, woodcuts, and ads, including an ad for Spalding Brothers Sporting Goods.\n\nPayPal is preferred but not required.  $80 shipped.  Price reduced to $59.  Will trade for ungraded lower condition T205's and T206's.\n\nThanks, Rick\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/bbphotos015.jpg[/IMG]",
