      "post_content": "Posted By: Rick McQuillan\nHello, I have an 1880's \"The Youth's Companion\" magazine.  The magazine is not dated, but judging from other that I have seen this appears to be from 1886-1888.  The magazine is bound with brown tape, and has some writing on the front cover.  Some of the pages are torn along the fold where the magazine was folded.  The interesting thing about this is the ad for a baseball game.  The ad doesn't mention Lawson's, but the pose and the style is similar to Lawson's.\n\nPayPal is preferred but not required.  $60 shipped, or will trade for lower condition T205's and T206's.  PRICE Reduced to $39 shipped\n\nThanks, Rick\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/bbphotos011.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/bbphotos.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g9/buymycards/bbphotos012.jpg[/IMG]",
