R. ROYER confectioner. There have been a few of these turn up along with a few other issues with the back stamp. Let me be clear it is not a genuine N172, however no one knows exactly when these were made, perhaps early in the 20th century or much later. I am selling it as a novelty piece $49\n\n2. mayo cut plug metal tobacco tag, pretty nice for one of these SOLD\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3659957-DSC01297.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3659958-DSC01298.JPG[/IMG]",
