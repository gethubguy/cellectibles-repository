      "post_content": "Posted By: ramram\nEarliest known set of baseball cabinet cards.  Eleven individual images of the 1869 Kearsarge Base Ball Team of Concord NH.  Each player is indentified lightly, in pencil, on the otherwise blank back.  Nine of the players have their position lightly noted in pencil on the front of the card.  These cabinet cards (4\" x 6 1/2\") still retain the red border and overall look of the predecessor CDV cards during this transition period when CDV's lost popularity to the new, larger cabinet cards.  Extremely rare, if not unique, to still have the entire set of an early baseball team. \nRob M.
