I hate to give that kind of hedge on a listing... I shined the blacklight - nothing glowed and nothing looks fishy.  If someone feels otherwise - let me know.\n\n\nAnyway - a great baseball image for $95.\n\nEmail with any questions.... and if you would like a better front / back scan - I can do that tonight and send it off to you.\n\nedit to add:  It measures approximately 4\" x 5\".\n\n[IMG]http://www.internetville.com/images/albums/userpics/10001/1800sball2.jpg[/IMG]",
