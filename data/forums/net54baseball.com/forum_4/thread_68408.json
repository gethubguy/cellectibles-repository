Anyone know who won that lot?  I have plenty of trade material in lower and higher grade including the following \"arms folded\" pose of Thompson (great card with a little back damage just like the cards in the Mastro lot).\n\n<CENTER>[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1192066067.JPG[/IMG]</CENTER>\n\nMy wantlist wouldn't be complete without listing the following items as well.\n\nN172 Lady Baldwin\nN172 Pete Conway\nN172 Pretzel Getzien\nN172 Deacon White\n\nDetroit cabinets (Tomlinson, N173, etc.)\nDetroit Gypsy Queens, etc.\n\nBest Regards,\nJoe Gonsowski",
