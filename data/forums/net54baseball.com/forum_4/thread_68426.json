My only\ncriterion for condition is that the card have most of the advertising elements intact, ie, name & team, Old Judge, copyright line, goodwin, etc...Otherwise the cards can be trimmed, torn, faded, creased, taped, holed, re-backed, rodent-nibbled, etc. \n\nMy budget for these 3-5 cards is $100-$200. Is this possible?",
