Not sure if this is part of a card game or was designed for children to play like they owned a General Store. Extremely early \"game\" that features among many things a Base-Ball (two words) for sale for 25 cents. The rest of the cards are very interesting, odd how a pound of chocolate cost $1.00 then, and still can be bought for about the same, shows you how far we have come. Other items include a Doll, Hobby Horse, Oatmeal, Coffee, Tea, Silk Hat, and my personal favorite A Monkey (only $1.00). The cards have some creasing but display very nicely. The backs are pretty clean with no damage (they are a light pale blue color). A few of the cards were colored with crayon or colored pencil long ago, kinda adds to the charm to me. If interested you are purchasing the group as a whole, would be willing to trade for items I have interest in.  $125 for the grouping \n-Rhett\n[IMG]http://starsofthediamond.com/bbgame.JPG[/IMG]",
