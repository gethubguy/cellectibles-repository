I have been rethinking my collecting habits and with the rising prices of the cards I am interested in I do not find as much pleasure in the hobby as I used to. I am keeping the Paul Hines stuff but all the others on the site are available. Please email me your best offers and I will respond in order. Thank all of you for the help with my collection over the years.\n [url]http://s228.photobucket.com/albums/ee75/Cincycards/[/url]\n\nTom",
