The quick skinny....I got it years ago from my my Dad's long time barber Lyle Simmons (who is in his 80s). His mother (Bessie Hartman) was Jimmy Sheckard's wife's (Fannie Eaves) sister in law. The book came to Lyle through his mother who got it from Sheckard's wife. All these people are from Columbia PA where Sheckard was born. Theres nothing in the book to support any of this, but thats the story I got when I got it about 10 years ago.\n\u00a0\n$260 delivered.",
