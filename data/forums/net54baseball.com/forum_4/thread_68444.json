This card is as nice as the SGC 20/FAIR one with back damage that sold on ebay the other day (item #190172854564) for over $1000.\n\nWould prefer to get something off my want list in trade, but I am open to other reasonable offers.\n\nkkkkandp@aol.com\n\nN172 Old Judge Players \u2013 Charlie Bastian, Thomas Burns, Mike Griffin (arms folded or batting), Frank Hankinson, John Harkins, William Hoover, Michael Hughes, John Kelly, Harry Lyons, Kid Madden (arms folded, bat next to rock), Jim McGarr (with umpire), Charlie Reipschlager, Taylor Shaffer, Leon Viau, James White, Ed Williamson & mascot\nN172 Old Judge Teams - Hartford, Jersey City, Lowell, Mansfield, Wilkes-Barre\n\n[IMG]http://members.aol.com/kkkkandp/welch.jpg[/IMG]",
