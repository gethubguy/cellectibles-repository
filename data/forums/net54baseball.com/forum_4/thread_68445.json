      "post_content": "Posted By: Casey\nGreat cabinet of 1885 Harvard Baseball captain Samuel E. Winslow.  Winslow was the team captain for Harvard's greatest team in 1885 that went 27-1.  He was also best friends with the author Earnest William Thayer who wrote \"Casey at the Bat\".  At one time, Thayer even claimed that Winslow was the inspiration for the Mighty Casey!  Winslow went on to serve in Congress and a long distingushed political career.\n\nThe cabinet is in fantastic shape with no dings, creases, writing, etc.  I will also include the research materials I received from Harvard to help me identify the photo as Winslow.\n\n$250 delivered. \n\n[IMG]http://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa299/cmoore330/H.jpg[/IMG]",
