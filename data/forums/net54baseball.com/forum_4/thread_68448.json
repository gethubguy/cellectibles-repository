      "post_content": "Posted By: Dave\n I am selling five lower condition Old Judges. $250 + $4.50 shipping for all five. Email me for pictures. \n players include:\nPeeples + Henderson double player card; bottom right of card is missing, and there are 2 pinholes in the top. Picture is great though on this rare double player example. \nHenderson P. Brooklyn facing camera throwing ; good condition with rounded corners and slight bit of paper missing at bottom left corner border area\n\nCline Sioux City; Fair condition paper missing at bottom right, faded picture, scuffing. still a hard to find team affiliation.\n\nSmith S.S. Brooklyns trimmed and likely rebacked, but the picture quality is outstanding\n\nMiller C. Pittsburgh Good condition but shows signs of trimming at bottom, slight ding at top center border, excellent crisp picture of Miller holding bat with hands at hips\n if you are getting started in to collecting Old Judges this is a good starter lot",
