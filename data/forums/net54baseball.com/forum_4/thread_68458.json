While spelling errors are not that unusual in the Old Judge set, none is close to being as pronounced as this one. This is your basic random letter accumulation. A very scarce and unusual card with corner wear and a name handstamp and writing on the back.----$1000. Please email me  for scans at oldjudge@gmail.com\n\nThanks!",
