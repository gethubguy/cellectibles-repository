      "post_content": "Posted By: scott brockelman\nI have 2 framed baseball team original photographs for sale.\n\nThe 1st is a late 1800's approx. 10\" x 8\" albumen photo on a larger mount in a period frame. The players all wear uniforms with Walker on them, except one which appears to say Macomis Bros?. Normal Bat, Ball & Glove display. The photo appears very nice with good contrast and clarity, it does have 2 old pinholes which I did not even see until removing it from the frame. Appears to have original glass as well. I would say this item has all been intact since made. $149 delivered. SOLD\n\nThe 2nd is an early 20th century small panoramic photo approx. 17\" x 8\", in what appears to be the original frame. The players are probably a school or town team and all have Lincoln on the jerseys. $49 delivered. SOLD\n\nScott\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716800-DSC01897.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716801-DSC01898.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716802-DSC01899.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716803-DSC01900.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716804-DSC01901.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3716805-DSC01902.JPG[/IMG]",
