Please check them out.  Here is a link:\n\n[url]http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=130189298330&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT&ih=003[/url]\n\nThese are all ungraded cards.

If you have things for sale on ebay, or other auctions, we do have a seperate category, about 5-6 below this one, for auction sales...ebay and others.....In the future if you could be so kind to put them in that category we would appreciate it...and it's part of the rules. No big deal we just try to keep things somewhat organized........good luck with them....",
