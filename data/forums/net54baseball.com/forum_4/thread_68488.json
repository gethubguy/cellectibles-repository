The gentleman I got it from gave me some more items in our trade so I will keep it and sell as is nice image of a potential future hofer. Please ask for a scan, it is a neat piece as he is in a baseball uniform/sweater. Thank you Leon for the info and Javan for your honesty. $250  \n\nFurthermore, I am told this piece was sold at 19th Century Auction house for $350 before the hammer 5 yrs ago.",
