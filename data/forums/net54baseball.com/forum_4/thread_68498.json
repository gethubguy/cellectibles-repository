I see for the very next thread that you are interested in a Bobby Mathews, so maybe you've changed your mind already.  If you do decide to sell, I'd certainly be interested in quite a few that you have, but sadly can't buy the whole lot.",

This is not a distressed sale or I would have given it to Mastro or Huggins & Scott, Lelands, Goodwin, Sloate, or some other reputable company.....I will upate the board if it will be sold together, piecemeal, or not at all, in the next few days.
