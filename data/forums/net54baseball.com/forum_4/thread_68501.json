Of course I still have cash available. While I do have quite a few Paul Hines cards already I am interested in others and possible upgrades. I am also looking for an N172 Jack Farrell tagging (yes you guessed it, Paul Hines is the one being tagged).\nI am also interested in Hunkey Hines N172's so please let me know what you have. \n\nThank you,\n\nTom",
