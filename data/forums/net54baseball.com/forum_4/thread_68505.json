      "post_content": "Posted By: leon\nMini Auction Rules\u2026..\n\nThese mini auctions will run approx. 2-4 days.  The Buy it Now price is just that. First one to email or post that they want it at the BIN price gets it. Other than that offers can be sent to leonl@flash.net. I will post the best current offer as quick as possible. If you don\u2019t see your best offer posted then I haven\u2019t seen it.  When the \u201cauction\u201d gets down to 2-3 folks I will make sure each person left has an opportunity to raise the offer.  Everyone should have a chance in this fashion. IF you are a serious bidder you will have an option to say \u201cno, that is more than I care to pay\u201d, before I close the auction.  I am offering Net120 terms on each card with a NON \u2013 REFUNDABLE 20% down payment, due within 2 weeks. If you want to pay by paypal then you need to add 3% to your payment(s). No credit cards can be accepted. NO RETURNS UNLESS I MAKE A MATERIAL MISTAKE.  All cards include guaranteed delivery via USPS REGISTERED MAIL.  Shipping, handling, and the tape I use are all FREE.  If I don\u2019t know you then I will ask for a few hobby references. I reserve the right to not accept any offer for any reason. I reserve the right to not sell any card for any reason. I reserve the right to change the rules at any time. I will try to give an indication of when the bidding gets to a point where the card will definitely sell. That being said I want to sell all of the cards that will be listed. Email me or call me with questions.  My cell phone number is 214-282-4943. I have it on almost all of the time and you can also leave a message. I will call you back. I can supply hobby references too [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG] ALL BIDDERS AND WINNERS WILL BE HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE\u2026..Good luck to all\u2026\n\nSOLD   \n\n[IMG]http://luckeycards.com/pn167ewing.jpg[/IMG]",

Some things can sell themselves without all of the hype we so commonly see.  \n\nI have made a decision to let this go until Tuesday evening, 2-5-08. I will be contacting anyone that has put a bid in on it at that time to go ahead and get final bids/offers and a winner will be determined at that time. thanks to all who have had interest and who have placed bids.....",

      "post_content": "Posted By: leon\nFirst of all this card did trade at 55k. So that is the price it was sold for....otherwise, it would still be live in auction. Thanks again to all bidders and the trust they had in me to put in relatively large bids. Even with a very slight glitch at the end it went very smoothly. I think everyone involved was fine with the way it was run. Everyone had equal opportunity to win it and Net54 shows we have the best audience in the industry again!!!! IN major auction, even at 15% commission to the buyer, this card would have cost $63,500 (after buyers premium)......Be ready for a better mouse trap in the future [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG].....\n\nThe provenance is that it most likely emanates from one of the true hobby pioneers, Walt Corson. I got this from ebay from Corson's best friends son, Jeff Lowe. Jeff's dad was Corson's best friend, James Lowe. Corson was a very good friend of Jeff Burdick of ACC fame and the grandfather (to me) of US card collecting. Corson was also an original inductee in the Card Collectors Hall of Fame. I think it's kind of neat knowing the history of the card for the last 50-60 years. I don't know where Corson got it though.....Also, after I won it on ebay I think we had a record number of folks our chatroom talking about it..I think it was 27 people in there......best regards",
