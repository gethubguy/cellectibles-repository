To date, this is the only example graded by SGC and one of the highest graded N338-2s. This card presents near-mint but suffers from a wrinkle in the bottom left corner. \n\nMany rank the rarity of the N338-2 set greater than the N690 Kalamazoo Bats (non-Giants and Mets) set and just under the N370 Lone Jack set. \n\n\nZach Rice\nZacharyrice@sbcglobal.net\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/Net54HessFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/mzm55cards/Net54HessBack.jpg[/IMG]",
