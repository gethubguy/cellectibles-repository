      "post_content": "Posted By: Lee\nOffered here is a really nice N172 Jerry Denny Old Judge, GAI 3. This card may be graded by GAI, but I believe they got it right on this one, a definite candidate for a crossover. There are no creases, only a few fine wrinkles on the back, no writing or paperloss, no aleration of any kind. The image is strong. Only minor edge and corner wear, which is consistant with a 4. The price is $230, scans are below. Please e-mail me with any questions or to buy the card.\n\nThanks,\nLee H\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1203276367.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1203276386.JPG[/IMG]",
