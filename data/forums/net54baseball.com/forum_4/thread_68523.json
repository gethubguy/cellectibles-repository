      "post_content": "Posted By: Phil Garry\nUp for sale tonght is a very nice 1888 Allen & Ginetr N28 Buck Ewing HOF card graded an SGC 10. Card presents quite nicely for the grade (see scans below) and the major issue is some paper loss on the front of the card over the \"York\" in Buck's uniform but does not detract tremendously because of the pastel colors of the card. Back of card has some staining but print is very ledgible. Sale price on this beauty is $200.00 dlvd. and the first person to e-mail me and say \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: vguerrerobb@yahoo.com\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BEwing.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/BEwingB.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThanks for your interest",
