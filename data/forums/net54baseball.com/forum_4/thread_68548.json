This beauty has been graded an SGC 40 by the strict graders at Sportscard Guarantee Company. This is 1 of only 3 of these cards ever graded by SGC. My asking price for this card is $800.00 dlvd. The first person to e-mail me and state \"I'll take it\" is the new owner. My e-mail address is: vguerrerobb@yahoo.com. Thank you for your consideration.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/PGalvin.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s120/bcbgcbrcb/PGalvinB.jpg[/IMG]",
