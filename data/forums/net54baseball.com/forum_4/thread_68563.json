I would like to own at least one just for the sake of having a piece of major league baseball history from kentucky.  If anyone has any low grade examples of any Louisville players they would like to sell please let me know.  I will have some extra money within the next few days so if you could email me scans and price's I would appreciate it and try to get the money together to send a money order as soon as possible.\n\n\nThanks William.  Email is wacturer@hotmail.com",
