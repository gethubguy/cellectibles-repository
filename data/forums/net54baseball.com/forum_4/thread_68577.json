Poor condition due to an apparent fire that broke out in the card's upper left corner.  Fortunately tiny firemen arrived in time to spare the rest of the card.  \n\n\n2) N172 Geiss, Chicago --- SOLD\n\nImage presents much cleaner and crisper in person.  My scanner and I are going to have to have a little talk.  \n\n\n\nemail:  boboinnes33@gmail.com\n\nthanks, \nAnthony Stephenson\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q82/boboinnes/geiss.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q82/boboinnes/Fogarty.jpg[/IMG]",
