      "post_content": "Posted By: Jonathan Rundlett\nThis item is page 9 from the \"Goodwin Tobacco Baseball Album: Champions 1888\".  It features 4 hall of famers from the 1888 World Champion New York Giants including Mickey Welch, J.M. Ward, William \"Buck\" Ewing and Tim Keefe.  This album is one of the earliest redemption pieces as it was forwarded to people who collected 75 tickets from cigarette packs in 1889.  \n\nPlease let me know if interested.  I can forward scans to anyone interested.",
