      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nI am going to keep a few of the cards in the photos but the graded cards listed below are available for sale if interested. Some of the raw cards may become available, but I will wait until I have them before I try to sell any of them to better evaluate condition.\n\nPrices are somewhat negotiable and please keep in mind that I do not yet have these in hand and the prices that are listed are based only on the scans provided. That being said I will not likely raise any prices but some may go down if there is unseen problems such as any back damage but as they are graded somewhat low if the card front appears really nice the back probably has some sort of damage so it would take something significant to change the price too much. Many of these cards present well for their grade.\n\n\nHenry Boyle (SGC 1.5)  $150\nCalifornia Brown (SGC 1)  $120\nSid Farrar (SGC 1.5) Father of Famous Opera/Film star Geraldine Farrar $200\nBill George (SGC 1)  $150\nGil Hatfield (SGC 1)  $150\nJack O'Brien (Brooklyn-Outdoor) (SGC 1) $175\nJohn O'Brien(Cleve) (SGC 1.5)  $150\nDanny Richardson (SGC 1)  $150\nCub Stricker (SGC 1.5)  $175\nSy Sutcliffe (SGC 1.5)  $150\nCount Weber (SGC 3)  $250\n\nPhoto 1:\nFarrar/Hatfield/Boyle\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/rea1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPhoto 2:\nSutcliffe/Weber\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/rea2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPhoto 3:\nRichardson/Jack O'Brien/George\nStricker/Brown\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/rea3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPhoto 4:\nJohn O'Brien\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/rea4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAlso available for sale are the following that I have in hand.\nFrank Wells (SGC 1.5) $165\n[IMG]http://www.geocities.com/rhettmatthew_37/n172wells.JPG[/IMG]\n\nBill Sowders (was GAI 1.5 due to back crease, but has been liberated from tomb-great image) $175\n[IMG]http://www.geocities.com/rhettmatthew_37/n172sowders.JPG[/IMG]\n\n\n\nemail directly to: rhettyeakley@netzero.com if interested.\n-Rhett",
