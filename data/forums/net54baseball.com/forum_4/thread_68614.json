      "post_content": "Posted By: Tony Andrea\nCirca 1880's-1890's cabinet photo of an unidentified black baseball player. Decked out with a nice hat, ring bat on shoulder, and ball in hand. It's extremely tough to find any baseball related items from this era that include black players and this ones a beauty. Overall size is 4-1/4\"x6-1/2\" and it's in wonderful condition. \n$685.00 delivered. Insurance & shipping on my dime. \nPlease email me if interested at andreatny@qwest.net \nThank you, Tony\n\n[IMG]http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/andreatny/africanamercabinet-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEdited to add trades welcome in header. Thx, Tony",
