Magazine articles, boxscores, newspapers, photos or anything that contains info.  Also still looking for a pitching pose N172 with clear image and the ever elusive N173 cabinet.  Even if you don't want to sell I would interested in any images you may have of him or the early AA Louisville teams. \n\nAlso...do any autographs exist of lesser known players in the Old Judge set?Does anyone know where one would look for such material.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks, \n\nPaul",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhys\nPaul\n\nAutographs from some of the Old Judge guys exist (I have maybe 10-15 different on my website for sale), however they are completely hit or miss.  I have never seen or heard of a Stratton signature and your best bet would be to try and contact other family members.  For example, exactly one Bob Allen (Old Judge Guy) signature was known to exist until his estate was uncovered last year.  Now there are a handful so that everyone who REALLY wants one can get one.  There was not a single Tony Mullane signature in the hobby but due a small stash of papers from his estate being found in a trash can at the Cook County Probate office, now there are roughly 15-20 examples.  It takes something like that to find some of these guys.  I would venture that only about 25%-35% of the Old Judge players have a known signature of them out there in hobby, but probably 85%-90% have a signature somewhere in an attic or in family scrapbook etc.\n\nRhys",
