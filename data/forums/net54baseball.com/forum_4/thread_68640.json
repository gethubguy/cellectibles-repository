      "post_content": "Posted By: Brian H (misunderestimated)\nI bought this recently but I have a Mayo card of Pfeffer as well as raw OJ I am getting graded (which I will probably also sell).  Looking it over closely I think the grade is fair -- the centering is terrible,  the corners are rounded but there are no creases and the back is very clean.\n\n\nBIO : Fred Pfeffer was the 2nd Basemen for the Chicago NL team (N/K/A \"the Cubs\")for several  years throughout their dominant period in the 1880's.  He was quite a character and he was one of the players Chicago team-owner A.G. Spalding took on his celebrated \"World Tour\" and his first-hand account in letters provides much of what is known about what it was really like.\n\n\nXXXXX -- includes insurance/shipping etc.\nPaypal accepted -- first to contact me accepting these terms at bhodes@rcn.com has priority.  \n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214186239.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214186289.JPG[/IMG]",
