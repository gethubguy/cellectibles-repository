I have never even seen(or heard of a set) that had 4 of the same Ad Backs. \n\nI'm on my way to Iraq, So I'm selling some things that will help me smooth over the transition to get me over there...... \n\nI have a little bit of money into this set, but I'm only interested in finding it a good home and recovering what I have into it.\n\nIf your at all interested, please email me at:\n\nirishdenny17@yahoo.com \n\n\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/52hvg5\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">[url]http://tinyurl.com/52hvg5</a[/url]>\n\n\nFirst one to strike a deal with me, its theirs!\nTHIS IS THE AD BACK ON ALL OF THEM!\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1213758241.JPG[/IMG]\"> \n\nLife's Grand,\nDenny Walsh",
