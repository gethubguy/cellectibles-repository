Denny, (Jerry, that is) was among the top 3rd baseman of the era and Fred Pfeffer was among the top 2nd basemen of the era and a mainstay for the Anson-led Chicago White Stockings (NKA -- the Cubs) . \n----------\n* edited to clarify that Pfeffer is in the Mayo set -- not Lyons\n edited second time to reflect new pricing\n* edited third time because (as someone graciously notified me) I confused Jerry Denny with Denny Lyons (again).\n\n [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214788511.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1214788546.JPG[/IMG]",
