      "post_content": "Posted By: Jon Canfield\nI have up for sale an outer shell for Kimball's \"Superlative Cigarettes\".  While this outer shell is missing its inner slide, the outer shell is in near perfect condition with a mint 1883 tax stamp (with undated overprint)on back.  This would be a perfect to compliment your N184 card or set (See Dave F's card for sale below!).\n\n$40.00 shipped.\n\n[URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=front1.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/front1.jpg[/IMG][/URL][URL=\"http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/?action=view&current=back1.jpg\"][IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/back1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
