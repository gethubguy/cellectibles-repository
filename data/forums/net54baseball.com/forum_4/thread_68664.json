      "post_content": "Posted By: Jared\nI'm looking for a low-grade N162 baseball player card.  I'm flexible on condition, so long as the player's face is clean (pinholes may be fine) and there's not major paper loss on the front (don't care so much about the back).  I'm looking to stay in the $150-300 range.  Raw or graded, but my preference is SGC.\n\nThank you very much!  Please post or email pics to: jarharrington@yahoo.com.",
