This tin dates from the 1880's and is made by the same company (Lone Jack) that produced the baseball cards.  However, I want to note that the cards came in cigarette packs, not tobacco tins although the graphics are identical. (see the photo of the cigarette pack for comparison which is NOT for sale) - tin is $50.00 shipped.\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/IMG_3365.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/jon_canfield/Cigarette%20Packs/LoneJackclose.jpg[/IMG]",
