      "post_content": "Posted By: leon\nUp for sale is one of the very 1st minor league cards ever produced (that we know)......There are a total of 3 cards known in total, from the whole set......The last one went publicly for around 18k+, 2-3 yrs ago. As far as I know the other 2, besides this one, are tied up in collections and not likely to see the light of day very soon... $29,000 delivered or trades +- cash or best acceptable offer.......They don't get much more rare than this ....\n\n[IMG]http://www.luckeycards.com/pnunc1886hancocksclothing.jpg[/IMG]",
