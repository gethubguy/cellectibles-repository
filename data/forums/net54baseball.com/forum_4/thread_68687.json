      "post_content": "Posted By: David Seaborn\nMy wife and I have been blessed with the arrival of twin girls.  While this has pleased me to no end, I've decided to sell what I feel is one of the nicest 19th Century baseball cards I've ever owned.  The resolution and contrast are incredible.  Take a look at the scan provided.  \n\nI will be venturing out a bit trying an auction format here on the BST, similar to what Leon has used in the past.  The auction will start at $6,500.  Bidding can be in any $100 increment over the current bid.  The current bid price will be raised $100 over the 2nd highest bid, just like if this were on eBay.  You may post your bid here or email me if you wish to remain private.  I will regularly update this page with the current bid.  The auction can end at any time if I receive an offer of $14,000 cash or cash/trade equivalent that I accept.  The initial phase of the auction will end at 1:00 PM EST on Sunday, August 3rd.  At that time the high bidder will win the card if 15 additional minutes go by without a new, higher bid.  If there is a new bid, the 15 minute clock restarts.  I will post any private bid amounts received via email on that day to keep this page current.\n\nThe winning bid price includes insurance and shipping through USPS reigstered mail.  Most of you know me, if not please feel free to contact Leon (or any other hobby reference), or take a look at my eBay feedback (id= oldoriole).  Please feel free to email me with a bid or with any additional questions (oldorioles@aol.com).  Thanks again, Dave Seaborn\n  \n\n[IMG]http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/2271/n370lonejackbushongsgc5yr8.jpg[/IMG]",
