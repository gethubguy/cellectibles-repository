It has been rebacked, which accounts for the reduced price of $500, shipped.  This is probably the cheapest Mickey Welch card you will ever find -- certainly for one with so nice a picture.  First one to email me at pstewart@kmob.com saying that they'll take it gets the card.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1217701586.JPG[/IMG]",
