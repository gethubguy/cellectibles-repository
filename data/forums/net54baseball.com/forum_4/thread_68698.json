Topps purchased a few of the originals to be inserted in the last couple years of their Allen and Ginter current issues.  Great looking front but back has writing and paper loss.  Asking $275.  Paypal add 3%.\n\nThanks.\n\n[URL=\"http://s244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/?action=view&current=caruthers2.jpg\"][IMG]http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/caruthers2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=\"http://s244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/?action=view&current=caruthers3.jpg\"][IMG]http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/caruthers3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/?action=view&current=caruthers4.jpg\"][IMG]http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/caruthers4.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=\"http://s244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/?action=view&current=caruthers1.jpg\"][IMG]http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/shawnstclair/caruthers1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]",
