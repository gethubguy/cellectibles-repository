I'd prefer SGC20 or under or raw and would really prefer a Chicago player. (I like to keep type cards limited to either Cubs or HOF.) Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",

It is in a SGC 20 holder, it wouldn't normally be for sale, but it seems to be just what you are looking for, so I'll make an exception. Let me know if there is interest or not.\n-Rhett\n\n[IMG]http://www.geocities.com/rhettmatthew_37/flintn284.JPG[/IMG]",
