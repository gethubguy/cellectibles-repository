      "post_content": "Posted By: ali_lapoint\nwhat i have here is very rare. it is a small CDV printed by the CD Frederick studio and has been authenticated by SGC as an 1860s period piece. the front of the CDV has the images of 100 of the Union Army's generals, officers, and admirals. every image is visible and unobstructed. amongst them is #55, Abner Doubleday. what makes this item even more rare and unusual is that the back of the CDV is not blank, but has a checklist of 1-100 identifying every image on the front. US Grant is also amongst those present. there are a few light creases and a light purple stain on the back that does not in any way interefere with the checklist or printing. to my knowledge it is the only one of its kind. i am looking for $1000 OBO. of course scans available upon request. e-mail with any and all questions.",
