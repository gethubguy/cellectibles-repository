Harrington replaced Lincoln's manager and along with him came 5 players that were on the Oshkosh roster.  Apparently Oshkosh really benefited from this move as that 1887 team looked pretty formidable.",

Both cards definitely look legit....(the other back is blank so I didn't post it)...Remember these are resized so exact dimensions need to be obtained from the seller....They are NOT in proportion to each other, size-wise....I think they might both be similar in size?\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1221230504.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1221230886.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1221230901.JPG[/IMG]",
