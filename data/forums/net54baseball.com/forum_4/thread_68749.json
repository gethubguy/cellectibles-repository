I was seriously considering going after this when I saw it earlier this week but your feedback scared the hell out of me.\n\nDo you care to comment why you have 7 negs and 2 neutrals on just 84 transactions?  Many of us here have zero to a handful of negs on many thousands of transactions.  So that kind of service doesn't make us feel confortable.\n\nWhat's the deal?",

Here's what the seller posted on the auction:\n\nOn Oct-16-08 at 06:52:28 PDT, seller added the following information:\n\n\nhello, I have gotten a few question concerning my feedback issues. I want to ease everyone's mind.. The past negative feedback came in a time when I was newly diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. it was a hard time for me. I took time off from selling on eBay to get health in order.\n \nsince I do have the negative feedback, eBay an PayPal have made it so I do not get paid on my auctions until YOU leave me positive feedback. So you really have nothing to worry about. I will not able to access your payment until YOU leave me positive feedback. \n \nSo, please bid with confidence.",
