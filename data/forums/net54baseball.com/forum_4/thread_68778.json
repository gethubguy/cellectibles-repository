The home page gives info on ordering and contact info and easy access to lists of all cards.  I had been selling on ebay (over 800 positives and 1 negative) using the user-id the-met-franchise.  Due to recent changes in ebay policies I have decided to sell using other computer and sport card magazine resources.  Web address is [url]http://mywebpages.comcast.net/paleymets/index.htm[/url]\nI'm listing this in all appropriate sections of this forum.",
