I am trying to hunt down two N172s for my pre-1920 Toronto collection.  I already have Serad, but have yet to even see scans of the other two, Buster Hoover and Deacon McGuire.  If you have either for sale (or can even provide decent scans of them), I'd love to hear from you.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard.",
