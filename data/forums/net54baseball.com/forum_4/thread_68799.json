      "post_content": "Posted By: Kevin Cummings\nGreat opportunity to knock a couple of Old Judge toughies off of your lists.\n\n\n\nTim Keefe - This card is the proverbial triple threat. It's a Hall of Famer, a two-player card (tagging Danny Richardson) and a horizontal pose all rolled up into one. Graded SGC 10 (POOR), it presents way better than the technical grade. Picture is strong, but the back is rather stained and has two wrinkles (as manufactured) in the cardboard backer. The wrinkles do impact the front of the card, but not appreciably. $850 delivered. If you bought these three OJ types separately, it would cost at least that much.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1228223105.JPG[/IMG] \n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1228223125.JPG[/IMG]\n\nBilly Serad - Scarce Toronto version. SGC 40. Picture is a tad light, but when was the last time you saw a Toronto Old Judge on ebay? When the Old Judge book comes out, go through all 2,426 cards pictured and see just how few Toronto cards there really are. [S]$325 delivered.[/S]SOLD!\n\n\nHave huge scans to email. Will consider trades for items on my Old Judge want list.",
