      "post_content": "Posted By: scott brockelman\nI am selling a cabinet that I have had in my collection for many years. A Pach Bros. photo of Dudley Dean, who was a 1st team All-American footbal player in 1890 for Harvard and Captain of the 1893 Harvard Baseball team. Much can be found on the internet about his playing days.\n\nExceptionally clean and glossy as made yesterday. The back is equally clean and has only a 3 digit penciled numeral which is probably a Pach Bros file number which is common on their cabinets.\n\n$900 delivered,\n\nScott\n\n[IMG]http://members.auctionhawk.com/sb1/3841414-img243.jpg[/IMG]",
