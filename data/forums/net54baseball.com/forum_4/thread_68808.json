Apparent on the scan of the back is a horizontal crease.  Not sure how it would grade, but it's still a beautiful N172 example of a potential HOFer.  SOLD!!\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nCraig\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1229297644.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1229297673.JPG[/IMG]",
