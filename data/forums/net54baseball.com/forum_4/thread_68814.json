      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nI am in the process of adding many items to my &quot;Pre-War For Sale&quot; page of my website. I have added a group of 22 N172's including some tougher players to the page. I will be continually updating the page over the next 2 weeks (as I will have a little extra time with the holidays)--so be sure to check back often. All the N172's include front and back scans so you can see what you are getting. Email any questions to  rhettyeakley@netzero.com \n\n\nFor Sale Page:\n[url]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/forsale.html[/url]\n\n\nAlso check out the other sections of my website, as there are many non-Pre-War Baseball items for sale also.\n\n\nWebsite Homepage:\n[url]http://www.starsofthediamond.com[/url]\n\n\nShipping will generally be around $5 regardless of # of items purchased--if the item is large in size it may be a bit more, however. Again, emails should go to rhettyeakley@netzero.com\n\n\nSome OJ's included in the sale:\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172burnsfb.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172traffleyfb.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172hendersonfb.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172peeplesfb.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172williamsonfb.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/n172oneilfb.JPG[/IMG]",
