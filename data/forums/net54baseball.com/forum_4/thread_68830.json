The grading is for corner wear and writing on the back. I find the writing on the back to be quite interesting, though. Someone, from long ago, kept track of Keefe's playing days on the back.\n\nIf you buy Old Judge cards for the corners, pass on this one. If you buy Old Judge cards for picture quality, this one is outstanding. You will be very happy with the picture quality on this one. It is very nice. The price of the card is $155, which includes insured shipping.\n\nIf you would like to buy the card, you can send me an E-mail at:\n\ncy@cyscards.com\n\nHere are the scans to view the front and back.\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/oldjudge/picsb/ojkeefeb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.cyscards.com/oldjudge/picsb/ojkeeferb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThank you.\n\nCy\nwww.cyscards.com",
