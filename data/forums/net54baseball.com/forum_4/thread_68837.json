I am really looking for a low grade or Authentic common to buy for a friendly price.  Please let me know, and/or email me scans/prices.\n\n\n\nThanks - Rob\n\n\n\n\nCheck out some of my collection!!!\n\n\n\nwww.myspace.com/robbiefrizzle",

      "post_content": "Posted By: Fred C\nRob,\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Make sure that the example you obtain is &quot;full card&quot;, not a card with the ad trimmed off the bottom.  Also, try to make sure that it is not skinned.  I've seen a lot of examples availble that may be inexpensive but they are also not great candidates to be a type card in a personal collection.  Also, pick an OJ that has a clear and clean (dark) image.  You'll be much happier with a nice example than a poor one.  You may have to pay a few dollars more but it will be worth it in the end.  Good luck!",
