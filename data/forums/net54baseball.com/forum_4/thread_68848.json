      "post_content": "Posted By: Anonymous\nMost likely a one-of-a-kind image of Manager Mutrie and some of his 1888 NY Giants players.  This is an 8x10 albumen (image portion is 6x8\u00bd). $950   \n\nNote - Just in case there is any confusion, CDV's and cabinet cards are also albumen images.  They (CDV's and cabinet cards) obtained their names because of their mass-produced, standard sizes.  This image is being called by its basic albumen name because it is larger than a cabinet card and the mount is not typical of an imperial cabinet card (an over-sized cabinet card), although one might call it that.  It is, however, very much a period image.  This type of image was not what one would expect of a mass-produced image and was probably made available only to one, or a few, of the players in the image.\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232126369.JPG[/IMG] \n\nStereoview of some soldiers in baseball poses.  Back of the image has old pencil inscription &quot;Encampment at Water Gap&quot;. $Sold\n\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232132171.JPG[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1232132184.JPG[/IMG] \n\nA neat view of the stereoview can be seen here (thanks Jimmy L.):\n\n[IMG]http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/8958/stereoanimtest2dz1.gif[/IMG]\n\nThanks,\n\nRob M.",
