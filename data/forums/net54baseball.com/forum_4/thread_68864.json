      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nI am currently accepting offers on an extremely RARE N175 Gypsy Queen (LARGE) John Ward card. \n\nThe large versions of the N175 Gypsy Queen's are legendary hobby rarities, with very few known examples in existence. They rank up there with other 19th century rarities  (Four Base Hits, K-Bats NY & Mets, etc.). The small N175 are tough in their own right but the large N175's are on a whole different level in terms or availablity.\n\nThe good news on the card is that the photo clarity is extremely nice and crisp, there are no tears or damage to the photo portion, and the card is an extreme rarity.\n\nThe bad news is that a long ago collector has trimmed the top &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; and the Goodwin at the bottom. The card is also partially skinned (meaning there is still some thickness overall but not to the extent as it was issued).\n\nI have scanned the item below next to a &quot;typical&quot; Old Judge card to show the difference in size.\n\nAs stated, at this point I'm currently accepting offers on this item, as I have no problem keeping the item in my collection and I am also not quite sure what the market is on this item.  Please email at rhettyeakley@netzero.com if you are interested. \n\n\nPhotos:\n[IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1233627909.JPG[/IMG]  [IMG]http://www.network54.com/Realm/tmp/1233627927.JPG[/IMG] \n\nFor reference here is a complete N175 Large Ward currently available online (though obviously in much nicer and &quot;complete&quot; condition):\n[url]http://www.legacyrarities.com/item.php?item=61[/url]",
