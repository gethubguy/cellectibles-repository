Am I wrong?\n\nMy apologies to anybody who gets annoyed by seeing this exact post in every section of the B/S/T, but I wanted to make sure that it gets seen by as many people as possible. \n\nIt seems that there are more and more of these posts every day. If you want to sell me something, show it to me, and tell me how much you want for it. That's all I ask. \n\nBest regards,\nDoug",
