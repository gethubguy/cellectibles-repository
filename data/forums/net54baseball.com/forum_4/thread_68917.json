I am looking for any low grade louisville old judge player regardless if it is graded or not.  I am from kentucky and still live here and I would just like to own one of them.  I will probably attend the national in cleveland to try and find one but who knows if they will have one or not.  This will be the last time I will have any spare money for a while so if anyone has won they would be willing to sell please email me.  Thanks for all your help\n\nWilliam\n\nemail is: wacturner@hotmail.com",

But, William Turner should have first shot at them, unless of course, he doesn't answer his email.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nFred\n\nCOWLESF@AOL.COM",
