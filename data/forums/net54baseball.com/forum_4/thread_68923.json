      "post_content": "Posted By: Jim\nI received the book that was the prize in the Net54 contest.  I absolutely enjoyed this publication with its history of the cards and the numerous pictures.  I have only owned one OJ in my life and that was for only about 2 weeks.  As soon as I complete several sets that I am working on, I plan to start picking up some OJs.  The time period and the cards themselves are intriguing.  It is the era of baseball that I know least about, and I look forward to learning more about this period through the work of the dedicated authors of this fine resource and from the cards themselves.  Thanks to the authors, Leon, and Net54 for providing an opportunity for me to learn more about this long lost era of baseball history.  If you are a fan of Old Judge cards, this book is an absolute must.",
