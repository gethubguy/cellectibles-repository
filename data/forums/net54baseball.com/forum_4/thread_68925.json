      "post_content": "Posted By: Sean\nok ths is kind of silly. It took me 25 years to get my first old judge cards.; I now have 3, yet two of them are the SAME Shorty Radford card!\nWas hoping someone out there might have a similar situation and want to trade. You can have your choice. My only stipulation is that I don't want a trimmed card. My preferences are outdoor poses, detroit, brooklyn, or chicago but I'll take what i can get [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]\nThe graded one is a little light and has the corner issue. The ungraded one is real nice but it has paper on it. Please help me out [IMG]https://www.net54baseball.com/images/happy.gif[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t85/milkit1/shortyradford.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t85/milkit1/shortyradfordback.jpg[/IMG]",
