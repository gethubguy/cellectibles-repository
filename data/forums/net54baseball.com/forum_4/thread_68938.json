      "post_content": "Posted By: Rhett Yeakley\nThe Winkelman pins are a 1909 issue, the 1919 date listed in the SCD is a mistake, they just accidently put a &quot;1&quot; where a &quot;0&quot; was supposed to be. The cool thing about Baerwald is that when he played in the Major Leagues he went by the name John Bell.\n\n-Rhett\n\nAlso not for sale, but your best bet with the items he is pictured on is the E254 Colgan's Chip, he is a fairly common minor leaguer in that set.\n[IMG]http://www.starsofthediamond.com/e254baerwald.JPG[/IMG]",
