    "post_content": "Hi all, \n\nRecently started a common cub project. Goal is to get 1 tough tough back of each cub player. Currently, I have a Kroh, Pfeffer, and a Sheckard no glove. If anyone can help me obtain the others that would be awesome. Have plenty of trade options, and am willing to pay market as well. Please let me know if you have anyone!\n\nemail:kaufmannb14@gmail.com\nPhone:219-218-8414\n\nThanks!",
