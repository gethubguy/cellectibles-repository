I'd like to trade it for one of a couple things (+/- cash as needed):\r\n\r\n-T227 Cobb (Miner\u2019s or Honest Long Cut) in PSA/SGC 2-3  \r\n-T206 Cobb Green or Bat Off in PSA/SGC 1-1.5 with high front eye appeal, plus cash\r\n-E95 or E90-2  or Cracker Jack Honus Wagner PSA/SGC 1-2 \r\n-1934 Goudey Hank Greenberg or Lou Gehrig PSA/SGC 4+\r\n-Other offers in that vein, worst I can say is no.
