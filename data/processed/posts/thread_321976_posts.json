I'm willing to compromise on condition, and whatever I get in return does not have to be t206 - so if you've ever wanted to transmogrify a t201 (or whatever) into a t206, now's your chance.\n\n\nTinker\nEvers\nChance\nGeorge Davis\nAddie Joss\nElmer Flick\nHome Run Baker\nJack Chesbro\nRube Waddell\nJimmy Collins\nSam Crawford\nWillie Keeler",
