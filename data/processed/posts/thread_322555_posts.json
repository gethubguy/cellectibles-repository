Nice as a PSA 3 maybe a 4\r\n\r\nPSA A Authentic Altered grade comes from someone touching up a spot in top left hand corner with red ink/marker. I\u2019ll also call out a slight crease at his forehead that is barely noticeable on rear of card but only goes from left edge to middle of Cobb\u2019s forehead. See closeup pic for red touchup. Centering and registration are excellent with good color too.\r\n\r\nSOLD or reasonable offer. Payment via PP F/F with free shipping. \r\n\r\nNot looking to trade on this one. \r\n\r\nThanks",
