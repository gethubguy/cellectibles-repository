If you have anything and would be willing to talk trade, please reach out.  I think I am real easy to work with, and talking trade is fun, even if nothing comes of it.  I bet I've made around 300 trades with net54 members.\r\n\r\nI also have three Speaker Cycle 350s that I could trade as I long as I keep one (SGC 2, PSA 3, PSA 4).",
