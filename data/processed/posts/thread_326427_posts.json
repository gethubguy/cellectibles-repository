    "post_content": "Available is about 25% of the t206 set and includes HoF, SL and commons in PSA slabs.  Most are in the 4-5 range but others fall on either side of that with some 1-2s and a few 6s.  Mostly common backs but there are a few Sovereign, Polar Bear and Old Mill sprinkled in there.  These are duplicates for me which is why they're available.  \r\n\r\nI have what is available on the registry and can be found in the link below.  No prices there but I'm happy to send you a complete list of asking prices if you send me an email at [url]tbrambo@yahoo.com[/url].  Prices on the sheet are asking, are net of any fees and include shipping.\r\n\r\nI've added a few scans but certainly not the 120 or so that are available.  \r\n\r\nIf you PM me (which is fine), I can't send you the .pdf so please email me and I'll get you the full list of what's left.\r\n\r\nHere's the link (with scans)\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/psasetregistry/baseball/t206-sets/1909-11-t206-complete-player-image-set-no-wagner-doyle-n-y-natl-plank-magie/publishedset/514650[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!",
