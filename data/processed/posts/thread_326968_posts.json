I'm around 460 or so and have almost all of the biggies.  \r\n\r\nIf you have PSA 2s ONLY (no qualifiers, no half grades, no SGC, etc) from the list and are looking to sell them, please let me know what you have w/price. \r\n\r\nPlease PM anything you may have and we can go to email if there's a deal to be had.  I did have my email address but I may have picked up a scammer with the cards they are sending from the list.   \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!",
