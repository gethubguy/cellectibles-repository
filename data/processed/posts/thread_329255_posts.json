    "post_author_name": "drazz5",
    "post_content": "I recently saw a video online of a jeweler who set himself a goal of turning $400 into a $100K piece of jewelry via the sale or trade of incrementally better pieces of jewelry. \n\nThis idea is reminiscent of the \"One Red Paper Clip\" challenge that was popularized many years ago. For those who aren't familiar, in 2005 a man by the name of Kyle MacDonald started with a large red paper clip and was able to make a series of trades over the course of a year that ultimately left him with a new house. I have found myself bored with my collecting recently, and for some reason, the video I recently saw piqued my interest. I thought this would be a fun (and difficult) experiment to apply specifically to the card collecting community. Being a t206 collector myself, $400 to $100K *roughly* translates into a John McGraw (Portrait with Cap) card to a low grade Eddie Plank. That being the case, I will make a low grade Eddie Plank my end goal for this exercise (outrageous, I know).\n\nThe criteria I have set for myself is pretty straight forward - I will start with my John McGraw card, and will trade or sell each subsequent card for a card of greater value. Being that I need to upgrade with each trade/sale I make, it obviously takes a very specific collector with specific needs to make each trade mutually beneficial. That being the case, I  have no idea how this will go, or how long it will take. I will keep this thread updated as my trades progress. \n\nSo without further adieu, please see the below McGraw for the very first card up for sale/trade.",

This is why I stressed the importance of finding the right collector(s) in my initial post. If a guy has been looking for a specific card forever, and I am able to provide him that card, I imagine he would be willing to give me a card that might be slightly higher in value to fulfill a specific collecting need that he has. If I fill a need, I would view a trade like that as mutually beneficial rather than \"ripping someone off\".\r\n\r\nBut to your point, this is going to require some creativity, especially since a Piedmont McGraw is not particularly special in any way. I expect I will have to do a lot of sideways trades to get unique back combos or branch out to other card types as you mentioned. \r\n\r\nAll part of the fun of this experiment. I know it will be challenge, but to be clear I have not idea if it will actually work.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

    "post_content": "I think this concept would work if you included trade+cash. So if you have the McGraw plus $50, maybe someone selling a $300 card that hasn't sold in two/three/four months might be inclined to take the offer. Then you have a $300 card, and you add $50 again, etc.\n\nAt some point, you would need to up the cash amount to $100, say once you start trading $1k/$2k level cards. And at some point you would need to up the cash amount again to $250 when you get to $10k level cards.\n\nPeople may not feel ripped off in this type of scenario because it would fall close enough to a 10% - 20% off sale value. Most sellers usually have 10% wiggle room to negotiate. \n\nSent from my SM-G9900 using Tapatalk",
