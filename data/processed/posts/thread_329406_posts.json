Will offer at $1450 F&F including priority shipping\r\nAdd 3% for G&S\r\n\r\nThis is the one and only card graded EX with none others graded higher for this brand/series/factory at SGC or PSA\r\n\r\nThe top pop PSA card sold this past April at Heritage for $1,500 and IMO this copy presents better on centering, corners and has deeper coloring\r\n\r\n[url]https://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball-cards/singles-pre-1930-/1909-11-t206-piedmont-350-460-42-george-mcquillan-with-bat-psa-ex-5-pop-one-none-higher-for-this-brand-series-factory/a/50053-53300.s?type=DA-DMC-VCP-Sports-50053-04142022[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks and Happy Holidays!\r\nWayne",
