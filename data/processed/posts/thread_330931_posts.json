    "post_content": "Presentable copies of the Jake Beckley and Vic Willis portraits.  I suspect the Willis has color added, thus resulting in the AA designation.\r\n\r\nSOLD. Payment via personal check, M.O., or PayPal \"gift\".  References available, just ask.  Commitment to purchase outweighs any ongoing negotiation.  I'd also gladly trade them for beaterish commons I need.\r\n\r\nPlease PM if interested.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nOther prewar cards including T206, T210, Ruth cards, and postcards:\r\n\r\n[url]www.collectorfocus.com/collection/seablaster[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83249/beckley[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83250/beckley[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83252/willis[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.collectorfocus.com/images/show/seablaster/t206/83253/willis[/IMG]",
