    "post_content": "Did anyone in here pick this Charlie Carr Sweet Cap factory 30 up over the weekend?  There was a grouping of 8 cards that I believe were cut from the same sheet - they all have similar top miscuts and backs that are centered the same way.  I had all of them in my cart, but when I went to purchase, someone had bought the Carr already.  These came from the \"Ohio find\" on ebay.\r\n\r\nI would like to reunite Carr with the rest.  It would be a shame that these cards stayed together for 100+ years only to be separated.  Let me know if you have any leads.\r\n\r\n [url]https://www.ebay.com/itm/145011542296[/url]\r\n\r\nAny opinions on the cards is welcome as well - I tend to think they are cut from the same page...  They look to be from the top of the sheet as well, since no name is found on the top.",
