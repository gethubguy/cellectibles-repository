    "post_content": "Ok, lets try posting this one again with some measurements and additional photos.  My other post had photos that were too large.  Sweet Caporal 150, Factory 30 back.  This card is slightly oversized in both directions measuring just over 1-7/16\" wide and a tad over 2-5/8\" tall.  No scuffs, creases or wrinkles.  Great color.  Some corner wear that is obvious/visible in the scans.  It is at least a vg, more likely a vg+.  In days past it would have been a solid vg/ex.  I don't play the grading game as I know what I'm looking at, but I did discount the price in case the new owner wants to send it to PSA or SGC themself for grading.  Asking $5,750 (net to me) obo, delivered, or best reasonable, serious offer.  Check, cash, paypal, postal money order, or a combination accepted for payment.  Doesn't matter to me.  Also, I can send you many references on this board upon request.  PM or email me to reserve.  Thanks for looking,\r\n\r\nAngyal\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=35780[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=35781[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=35784[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=35783[/IMG][IMG]http://www.net54baseball.com/picture.php?albumid=150&pictureid=35782[/IMG]",
