    "post_content": "*T206 Near Set Break!*\r\n\r\nI'm breaking up my mid-grade PSA set representing approximately 350 cards from PSA 2 to 5, predominantly 3-5.  I aimed for strong centering and good eye appeal, so they are generally quite nice looking.  Good mix of HOF, SL, SP, and commons, though I think a higher ratio of commons may be left.  Mostly common backs, though there are lots of OMSL.\r\n\r\nEverything is listed and priced in a spreadsheet here: [url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cv4ByQLdUxsh2wkATC378crUbbU3NFwrSa-PsN4a9KQ/edit?usp=sharing[/url]\r\n\r\nEmail: [url]vettejayk@aol.com[/url] to discuss\r\n\r\nTo ballpark as a baseline: PSA 3 $120; PSA 4 $175-200; PSA 5 $300.\r\n\r\nLink to PSA Set Registry (most cards listed): [url]https://www.psacard.com/psasetregistry/publishedset/574511[/url]\r\n\r\nLink to ebay store for pictures (approximately 2/3 of the cards listed and marked \"set break\"): [url]https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p3692&_ssn=vettejayk123[/url]",
