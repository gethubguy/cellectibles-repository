The three players are:\r\n\r\nAl Bridwell\r\nLefty Leifield\r\nPaddy Livingston\r\n\r\nWould prefer raw. The back brand / condition does not matter but would prefer decent eye appeal on the front. Not picky with variation either. Please PM me with what you may have available if you're looking to sell.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
