Figured I\u2019d solicit the group to see if there\u2019s any from my list available out there.  I\u2019ll take any grade on the rares but probably not interested in cards with major paper loss - creasing may be acceptable.  Here\u2019s the cards I\u2019m looking for:\n\n-Barbeau: Carolina Brights\n-Bliss: EPDG\n-Charles: Sweet Caporal\n-Gilbert: Old Mill\n-konetchy near ground: piedmont/sweet cap 460 series or hindu???\n-Phelps: Ab350 or BL350\n-Rhodes: Ab350, BL350 or cycle\n-Willis Throwing: piedmont or sweet cap 460\n\nLet me know if you have anything!\nPaul Curlee\n915-449-7623\n[url]Paul.curlee1@gmail.com[/url]",
