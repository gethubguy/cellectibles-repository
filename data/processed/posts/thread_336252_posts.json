    "post_content": "FS: T206 Nap Lajoie Throwing - Old Mill SGC 2.5 - SOLD (or best offer)\r\n\r\nI'm collecting the set without regard to back, so this card doesn't fit my collection as much as I assume it might for others.  Based on the pop report, I think this is a fairly tough combo for Old Mill collectors.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to cash offers, I'd also potentially be interested in a trade for the same card in Piedmont/Sweet Cap back in similar grade (2-3, PSA or SGC), plus a reasonable cash kicker that could be negotiated.  \r\n\r\nAny questions, please feel free to reach out.",
