It was in dad and my collection for around 2 decades - we somehow got INSANELY lucky to find one that we thought MAY be brown listed on eBay - before it was as popular as it is today.  I had already been wrong around half a dozen times at this point \u2026 but was definitely not wrong once the card arrived.  I only traded it to Ryan Bc he had a dupe BOM for our collection.  I have zero concern about its authenticity and apparently SGC agrees.  So for those who want a \u201cHank and Scott\u201d pedigree rareback - this is your chance :)\r\n\r\nHappy collecting everyone.",
