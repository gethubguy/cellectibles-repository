To be honest, I'm not in a real hurry to sell it and based on it's eye appeal alone, I'm getting pre \"Seller's Remorse\" if in fact that is a thing?! lol\n\nI'll keep this up until midnight Eastern tonite. If it has not sold, I'll take it down and keep it a little longer. No pressure, just facts! :) Thanks",
