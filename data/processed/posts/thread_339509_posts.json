Given the volume, in an effort to minimize back and forth, I am looking to pay the price from the PSA guide (path at bottom). If you have cards that fit the criteria, assuming I don't already have that card, I am willing buy it/them off of you at the price listed below. \r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/priceguide/baseball-card-values/1909-11-t206-white-border/1055[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\nTaylor",

I looked up a few and just as an example, it's saying a cy young portrait psa 2 would be 1300. If anyone is selling one for under 2300 (a full 1k over \"book\"), I'd love to see it.",
