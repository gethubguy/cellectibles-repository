    "post_content": "I would also give consideration to sending to an auction house such as Robert Edwards Auctions or Love of the Game Auctions, among others.  With a card like that you should be able to auction it off without paying a seller's commission.\n\nAlso keep in mind that not all PSA 3s are created equal and some will sell for a slight premium over others based on color, registration, centering, lack of stains, lack of creasing, etc.\n\nSelling here on BST is all good and definitely a good option, but one problem with a fairly inexperienced seller is you have to either roll the dice with an auction here, or list it with a \"buy it now\" price which can be tricky to price correctly with limited experience and knowledge.  I would give consideration to selling here as a live auction, but check with Leon the moderator first or read the threads in the auction section to get the best idea on how to do it.\n\nI have also seen examples where someone offers a card here for sale for X amount of dollars, it does not sell, but then they list it with an auction house and it sells for significantly higher than they were asking outright on the BST.  An auction creates that competitive bidding where you commonly see the highest prices.\n\ngood luck with the sale",
