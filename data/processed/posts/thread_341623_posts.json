    "post_content": "This November I am wanting to buy 1 or 2 big T206 HOFers and right now I am trying to get a sense of what might be available so I can prioritize, as I will not have the funds to purchase everything I want. Below is what I am looking for - my budget will require lower grades, in the 1-2 range. If you have anything you'd be open to selling in November, please send me a DM. Thank you!\r\n\r\nT206 Ty Cobb Green\r\nT206 Ty Cobb Bat On\r\nT206 Ty Cobb Bat Off\r\nT206 Cy Young Bare Hand Shows\r\nT206 Cy Young with Glove\r\nT206 Christy Mathewson White Cap\r\nT206 Nap Lajoie Portrait\r\nT206 Nap Lajoie Throwing\r\n\r\nBacks not important for these cards. \r\n\r\nChris",
