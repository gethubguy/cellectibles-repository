    "post_content": "I am looking for the following players, with these specific backs. Low grade is preferred - these are for a binder set:\r\n\r\nEd Abbaticchio (Brown Sleeves): EPDG\r\nHowie Camnitz (Arms Folded): EPDG\r\nTommy Leach (Portrait): Hindu\r\nLefty Leifield (Pitching): Hindu\r\nNick Maddox: Carolina Brights or Cycle 350\r\nDeacon Phillippe: Carolina Brights or Cycle 350\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have anything. I only need one of each back. So if I were to find an Abbaticchio EPDG, I would no longer need the Camnitz. \r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide. \r\n\r\nChris",
