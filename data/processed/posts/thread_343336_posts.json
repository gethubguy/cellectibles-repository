    "post_content": "Just bought a large collection which had a ton of Bowman and other reprint sets.  Included was the 523 ct. 1983 Renata Galasso Capital T206 Reprint set.  This is the set without the perforated edges and has \"CAPITAL REPRINT\" on the baks of each card.  No comps on eBay but I feel I saw a few go last year for ~$100.  Any interest/comps/info?\r\n\r\nFWIW set is nice and in 18 pocket pages.  If interested PM me with your email and I can email pics.  If I don't receive any interest I will post on eBay next week.\r\n\r\nThanks",
