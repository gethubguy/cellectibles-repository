I collected a purchase yesterday through a member on the site, and want to see if anyone here has a few cards to help me complete my first small T206 run. I have 4 of the 6 horizontal cards from the set and need two more to finish it off. If anyone has a Pattee or Mullins graded or non graded I would be very interested in buying.  Thanks for the help, and I look forward to seeing some of your cards.",
