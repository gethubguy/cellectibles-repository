I\u2019m not real proficient with posting pictures on here, so if you\u2019re interested in either send me a PM and I\u2019ll email or text you some pics. \n\nMordecai Brown (port.) Piedmont 350\u2026\u2026$275\n\nJoe Tinker (port.) SC 150/30\u2026..$300\n\nThe Tinker is nice\u2026..it was formerly in a SGC 1 holder but is now raw. I can include the flip. It has a nipped corner, hence the previous grade. It was also part of the Joe Garagiola collection and is labeled accordingly.",
