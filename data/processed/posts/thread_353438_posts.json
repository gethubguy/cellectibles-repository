    "post_content": "Does anyone have lots available of multiple rough/low grade raw t206\u2019s? I\u2019m starting a very long term build of the set and would like to get a nice jump on the commons. I\u2019m not picky on condition as this is definitely a budget build.  I\u2019m more than ok with rips and tears and paper loss, etc. would prefer if a card is ripped in half that there at least be both pieces of the card:D . But if anyone has a nice stack that they want to just move in bulk, I\u2019d love to take a look.",
