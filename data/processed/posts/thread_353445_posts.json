Currently, I am about 1/3rd of the way there. Given the volume, in an effort to minimize back and forth, I am looking to pay the price from the PSA guide (path at bottom). If you have cards that fit the criteria, assuming I don't already have that card, I am willing buy it/them off of you at the price listed below.\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.psacard.com/priceguide/baseball-card-values/1909-11-t206-white-border/1055[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTaylor",

Rather, this is the community trying to help and point out that the information you are referencing is badly out of date and thus may not be the best resource in your pursuit of the monster. No one here is crass or snarky by any means and we all ideally share our knowledge to help fellow collectors. \r\nAs Mantle77CA pointed out look at the current REA prices ending tonight.",
