    "post_content": "Good morning, \r\n\r\nI had this group of T206 Commons, and minor star is available for sale as a large lot but wasn\u2019t able to move it so I am now breaking up the lot and selling individually\r\n\r\nI know a lot of us participate here and several Vintage Facebook pages so you\u2019ll probably see this post a couple of times but I wanted to let folks know they are cross posted so sales may occur here and there.\r\n\r\nFYI, I\u2019ve priced these using sold prices for grade 2 of each card as a reference point.  I realize these are not graded, but I have submitted many cards from this collection for grading recently, and the average grade received was too, so I thought that might be a logical anchor point for pricing.\r\n\r\nOpen to offers, of course. But like always, anyone who claims as sold will supersede any ongoing offers or negotiations. I think most of us know that drill pretty well.\r\n\r\nToo many pictures to post individually so here\u2019s a link of all 140 or so cards. Several have already sold this morning, please reach out or post here for any claims or questions.\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n[url]https://photos.app.goo.gl/CibGi7CjLc1HmqAx8[/url]",
