PayPal or Zelle.\n\nI would consider trade for Piedmont 42 HOFers that I need. I also need a Cobb Bat On and Crawford Throwing to finish off my HOFer set. Looking for SGC 3-4 holders for Cobb and Crawford. I\u2019m not picky on P42, just trying to put a couple more together. As always a cash take it has rights to that card if a trade isn\u2019t finished first.\n\nJimmy Collins SGC 4 P350- $435\nMcGraw no cap SGC 3.5 P150- $360\n\nWaddell SGC 3 P350- $$$0ld\nBeckley P350 SGC 3 P350- $$$0ld\nChase Blue (super sharp, spot of paper loss on back) SGC 3 SC350/30- $$$0ld\n\nThanks,\nBob\n\nPM me with any questions.",
