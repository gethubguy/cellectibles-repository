He comes both in the 150 and 350 series and while pops are relatively the same I almost never see the 150 come up for whatever reason. None presently for sale on ebay (there's 1 350).\r\n\r\nA PSA 2 did $183 last night in Goldin.\r\n\r\nSold here or via PM trumps any offers or on going negotiations. Price is net to me and delivered. Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\n$100 ***SOLD***\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53407252124_4b3d2d458a_c_d.jpg[/IMG]",
