    "post_content": "Looking to move my Tolstoi Bill Burns. This is a near impossible back for Burns. I believe there are a total of 6 graded between PSA and SGC. That number also does not take into account crossovers, so it is most likely closer to 4-5. Looking for 200.00 net on this one. If you\u2019re interested, shoot me a PM and I will email or text you pictures.",
