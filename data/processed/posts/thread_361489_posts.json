Looking for VG or VGEX.\r\n\r\nI have a Bender Trees with a P350 back in a PSA 4.5 holder and a Bender No Trees EPDG in a SGC 3. I could trade those, my other HOFers in my other recent post, cash and trade or cash.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you would part with. This card comes with some fun backs, so hopefully some will part with one.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your Sunday,\r\nBob",
