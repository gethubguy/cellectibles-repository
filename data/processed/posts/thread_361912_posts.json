    "post_content": "Available for sale are the following cards:\n\nT-206 - Frank Chance Yellow Portrait [Piedmont/SGC \"4.5\"] - SOLD\nT-206 - Mordecai Brown Portrait [Piedmont/SGC \"1.5\"] - SOLD\n\nThe Brown has deep red background and terrific eye appeal.  The prominent flaw relates to a small amount of paper loss on the back of the card to the right of \"The Cigarette of Quality\".  I am not a professional grader, but I believe the small amount of paper loss on the back takes this card down a whole technical grade.  This is a card where the eye appeal exceeds the technical grade.\n\nIf you want to purchase either card:\n\n1. The first person to post \"I'll take it\" will get the card. This post will secure the card in front of anyone else who may be in communication with me regarding that card.\n2. Email me at [url]jmanners51@gmail.com[/url] by putting the name of the card in the subject line and your address in the text.\n3. Remit payment by PayPal (PPFF - the price above is NET TO ME).\n4. I don't have easy access to a Post Office so please allow up to 5 days for me to get to the Post Office to mail the card.",
