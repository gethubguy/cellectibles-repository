The corners are really nice for the grade.  It's clearly an older grading model that really penalized you for a miscut, even though the name on top is desirable. There is a scratch on the front of the Bell slab.\n\nPlease note: I have over 150 graded T206 cards available.  I'll be listing them here, but email me at [url]jcotgreave@gmail.com[/url] if you'd like a list.\n\nIf you want to purchase any cards:\n1. The first person to post a full price offer on this thread will get the card.\n2. Email me at [url]jcotgreave@gmail.com[/url] and let me know which card(s) you want.\n3. Remit payment by PayPal - FF or venmo.\n4. Cards will be shipped within 2 business days.",
