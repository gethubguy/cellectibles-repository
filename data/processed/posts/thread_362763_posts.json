The Evans craze seems to be over but this is still a VERY difficult card to find in an off back. Currently one Tolstoi FS on eBay. \r\n\r\nFront is nice. Great color. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE AT SOME POINT POST ENCAPSULATION A SMALL PIECE OF THE BACK FLAKED OFF AND YOU CAN SEE IT STILL IN THE HOLDER. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to price for what I think a 1.5 EPDG would go for. Common back 1.5\u2019s seem to do about $115. \r\n\r\n$215 ***SOLD***\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://www.flickr.com/photo_download.gne?id=53340691088&secret=483362e43a&size=c&source=photoPageEngagement[/IMG]",
